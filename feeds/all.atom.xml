    <title>Copilot lied</title>
    <updated>2026-02-21T14:47:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, with &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html"&gt;my experiment with
Copilot&lt;/a&gt; having settled down a
little bit, I thought I might try and use the result for another little
experiment. For a long time now I've maintained a (currently lapsed)
photoblog. It was always very much tied to &lt;em&gt;"the site formerly known as
twitter"&lt;/em&gt; and, since I fully erased my account after the site turned into a
&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Nazi bar&lt;/a&gt;, I've not done anything
to update how it gets populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got to thinking: I have a full backup of all the images in a couple of
places; perhaps with a bit of coding (and some help from "the AIs") I can
revive it using &lt;a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;BlogMore&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tinkered for a wee bit and mostly got something going (albeit I'm going to
have to do some work to back-port the actual dates and times of some earlier
images, and there's a load of work to do to somehow pull out all the tags).
But then I hit a small hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building BlogMore I made the decision to let it write both the code
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the documentation. It documented a couple of features I never asked
for, but which seemed sensible so I never questioned. On the other hand
neither did I test them at the time (because they weren't important to what
I needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the exact reason I added this warning at the start of the
documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-warning"&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition-title"&gt;⚠️ Warning&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlogMore is an experiment in using GitHub Copilot to develop a whole
project from start to finish. As such, almost every part of this
documentation was generated by Copilot and what it knows about the
project. Please keep this in mind.

From what I can see at the moment the documentation is broadly correct,
and I will update and correct it as I work through it and check it myself.
Of course, I will welcome reports of problems or fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this warning in mind, and with the intention of working through the
documentation and testing its claims, I decided to test out one of the
features when building up the new photoblog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas with this blog I keep all the posts &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/tree/main/content" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in a flat
structure&lt;/a&gt;,
this time around I thought I'd try out this (taken from the
Copilot-generated BlogMore documentation):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlogMore is flexible about how you organise your posts. Here are some common patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat structure&lt;/strong&gt; (all posts in one directory):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;posts/
  ├── hello-world.md
  ├── python-tips.md
  └── web-development.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Files can be date-prefixed (e.g., &lt;code&gt;2026-02-18-hello-world.md&lt;/code&gt;) and BlogMore will automatically remove the date prefix from the URL slug. The post will still use the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; field from frontmatter for chronological ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organised by date&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;posts/
  ├── 2024/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   │   └── hello-world.md
  │   └── 02/
  │       └── python-tips.md
  └── 2025/
      └── 01/
          └── web-development.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organised by topic&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;posts/
  ├── python/
  │   ├── decorators.md
  │   └── type-hints.md
  └── web/
      ├── css-grid.md
      └── javascript-tips.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the hierarchy approach, especially with dates, seemed ideal! I'd drop
the actual images in such a hierarchy, and also drop the Markdown posts in a
parallel hierarchy too. Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set it all up to do that, fired up &lt;code&gt;blogmore serve&lt;/code&gt;, visited the URL
and... &lt;code&gt;No posts yet&lt;/code&gt;. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I checked the code for BlogMore and, sure enough, despite the fact the
documentation was selling me on this handy way to organise my posts, no such
feature existed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an experiment &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/issues/129" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I then asked Copilot what the heck was going
on&lt;/a&gt;. Much as I expected,
rather than coming back with an answer to the question, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/130" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it went right ahead
and fixed it instead&lt;/a&gt;. Which is
fine, that's where I would have taken this, but I do wish it would answer
the question first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-note"&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition-title"&gt;ℹ️ Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine I could get an answer to the question if I took a more
conversational route with Copilot, rather than writing the question in an
issue and then assigning that issue to it. I must remember to try that at
some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, unsurprisingly Copilot flat out lied&lt;sup id="fnref:21-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the documentation. I'm
not in the least bit shocked by this and, as I said, I fully expected this.
But it was amusing to have an example of this turn up so early in the
documentation, in such a glaring way, and in a way that was so easily fixed
(really, it was just a swap of
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Path.glob&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Path.rglob&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I play with this more it's going to be fun to see what other bold claims
turn out to not be true; or perhaps even the reverse: what neat features
lurk in the code that haven't been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:21-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, as I mentioned yesterday, that's an anthropomorphism. Folk who
take such things as an indication that you don't understand "AI" might
want to think about what it is to be a human when communicating.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:21-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Five days with Copilot</title>
    <updated>2026-02-20T15:46:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="another-itch-to-scratch"&gt;Another itch to scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2026/02/19/a-new-engine.html"&gt;I mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I've been a happy
user of &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; for a couple or so years now, but
every so often there's a little change or tweak I'd like to make that
requires diving deeper into the templates and the like and... I go &lt;em&gt;"eh,
I'll look at it some time soon"&lt;/em&gt;. Another thought that often goes through my
head at those times is &lt;em&gt;"I should build my own static site generator that
works exactly how I want"&lt;/em&gt; -- because really any hacker with a blog has to
do that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... I've had free access to &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub
Copilot&lt;/a&gt; attached to &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;my GitHub
account&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, and I've hardly used
it. At the same time -- the past few months especially -- I've been watching
the rise of agents as coding tools, as well as the rise of advocates for
them. Worse still, I've seen people I didn't expect to be advocates for
giving up on coding turning to these tools and suddenly writing rationales
in favour of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, suddenly, the idea popped into my head: I should write my own static
site generator that I'll use for my blog, and I should try and use GitHub
Copilot to write 100% of the code, and documentation, and see how far I get.
I doing so I might firm up my opinions about where we're all going with
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements were going to be pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be a static site generator that turns Markdown files into a
  website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be blog-first in its design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should support non-blog-post pages too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be written in Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should use Jinja2 for templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have a better archive system than I ever got out of my Pelican
  setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have categories, tags, and all the usual metadata stuff you'd
  expect from a site where you're going to share content from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the requirements would drift and expand as I went along and I had
some new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kick things off, I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;my repo&lt;/a&gt;,
and then opened Copilot and typed out a prompt to get things going. Here's
what I typed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a blog-oriented static site generation engine. It should be built in
Python, the structure of the repository should match that of my preferences
for Python projects these days (see https://github.com/davep/oldnews and
take clues from the makefile; I like uv and ruff and Mypy, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is written in markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All metadata for a post should come from frontmatter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should use Jinja2 for the output templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, rather than get very explicit about every single detail, I
wanted to start out with a vague description of what I was aiming for. I did
want to encourage it to try and build a Python repository how I normally
would, so I pointed it at &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;OldNews&lt;/a&gt; in the
hope that it might go and comprehend how I go about things; I also
doubled-down in the importance of using &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mypy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this was... &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;actually
impressive&lt;/a&gt;. As you'll see in that
PR, to get to a point where it could be merged, there was some
back-and-forth with Copilot to add things I hadn't thought of initially, and
to get it to iron out some problems, but for the most part it delivered what
I was after. Without question it delivered it faster than I would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some early issues where I had to point out problems to Copilot included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order of posts on the home page wasn't obvious to me, and absolutely
  wasn't reverse chronological order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Footnotes were showing up kinda odd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main index for the blog was showing just posts titles, not the full
  text of the article as you'd normally expect from a blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing terrible, and it did get a lot of the heavy lifting done and done
well, but it was worth noting that a lot of dev-testing/QA needed to be done
to be confident about its work, and doing this picked up on little details
that are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="an-improvement-to-the-markdown"&gt;An improvement to the Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside: during this first PR, I quickly noticed a problem where &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904192942" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I was
getting this error when generating the site from the
Markdown&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error generating site: mapping values are not allowed in this context
  in &amp;quot;&amp;lt;unicode string&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 3, column 15
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just assumed it was some bug in the generated code and left Copilot to
work it out. Instead it came back and educated me on something: &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904197313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I actually
had bad YAML in the frontmatter of some of my
posts&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, by the way, wouldn't be the last time that Copilot found an issue with
my input Markdown and so, having used it, improved my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-major-feature-from-a-simple-request"&gt;A major feature from a simple request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem I ran into quickly was that previewing the generated site
wasn't working well at all; all I could do was browse the files in the
filesystem. So, almost as an offhand comment, in the initial PR, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904205550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I
asked&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we get a serve mode please so I can locally test the site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like that, it went off &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1/changes/3449eec9b4df88e66eec0f6bba4369926ff1389e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;and wrote a whole server for the
project&lt;/a&gt;.
While the server did need a lot of extra work to really work well&lt;sup id="fnref:127-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the
initial version was good enough to get me going and to iterate on the
project as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-main-workflow"&gt;The main workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having kicked off the project and having had some success with getting
Copilot to deliver what I was asking for, I settled into a new but also
familiar workflow. Whereas normally, when working on a personal project,
I'll write an issue for myself, at some point pick it up and create a PR,
review and test the PR myself then merge, now the workflow turned into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an issue but do so in a way that when I assign it to Copilot it has
  enough information to go off and do the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for Copilot to get done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the PR, making change requests etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make any fixes that are easier for me to fix by hand that describe to
  Copilot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the first step had some sub-steps to it too, I was finding. What I
was doing, more than ever, was writing issues like I'd write sticky notes:
with simple descriptions of a bug or a new feature. I'd then come back to
them later and flesh them out into something that would act as a prompt for
Copilot. I found myself doing this so often I ended up adding a "Needs
prompt" label to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/setup-standard-labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;usual set of issue
labels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this made for an efficient workflow, and one where I could often get
on with something else as Copilot worked on the latest job (I wasn't just
working on other things on my computer; sometimes I'd be going off and doing
things around the house while this happened), but... it wasn't fun. It was
the opposite of what I've always enjoyed when it comes to building software.
I got to dream up the ideas, I got to do the testing, I got to review the
quality of the work, but I didn't get to actually lose myself in the flow
state of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I've really come to understand during those 5 days of working on
BlogMore was I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; missed getting lost in the flow state. Perhaps it's
the issue to PR to review to merge cycle I used that amplified this, perhaps
those who converse with an agent in their IDE or in some client application
keep a sense of that (I might have to try that approach out), but this feels
like a serious loss to me when it comes to writing code for personal
enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-main-problems"&gt;The main problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's fair to say that I've been surprised at just how well Copilot
understood my (sometimes deliberately vague) requests, at how it generally
managed to take some simple plain English and turn it into actual code that
actually did what I wanted and, mostly, actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my experiences over the past few days haven't been without their
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-confidently-wrong-problem"&gt;The confidently wrong problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we all recognise that, with time and experience, we learn where
the mistakes are likely to turn up. Once you've written enough code you've
also written plenty of bugs and been caught out by plenty of edge-cases that
you get a spidey-sense for trouble as you write code. I feel that this kind
of approach can be called cautiously confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Copilot&lt;sup id="fnref:127-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, however, I often ran into the confidently wrong
issue. On occasion I found it would proudly&lt;sup id="fnref:127-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; request review for some
minor bit of work, proclaiming that it had done the thing or solved the
problem, and I'd test it and nothing had materially changed. On a couple of
occasions, when I pushed back, I found it actually doubting my review before
finally digging in harder and eventually solving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that this took time and was rather tiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also times where it would do the same but not directly in respect
to code. One example I can think of is when it was confident that Python
3.14 was still a pre-release Python as of February 2026 (&lt;a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it
isn't&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem alone concerns me; this is the sort of thing where people
without a good sense for when the agent is probably bullshitting will get
into serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-tries-too-hard-problem"&gt;The tries-too-hard problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variation on the above problem works the other way: on at least one
occasion I found that Copilot tried too hard to fix a problem that wasn't
really its to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I was asking it to tidy up some validation issues in the RSS
feed data&lt;/a&gt;. One of the main
problems was root-relative URLs being in the content of the feed; for that
they needed to be made absolute URLs. Copilot did an excellent job of fixing
the problem, but one (and from what I could see only one) relative URL
remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110#issuecomment-3928257463" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;asked it to take a
look&lt;/a&gt;
and it took a real age to work over the issue. To its credit, it dug hard
and it dug deep and it got to the bottom of the problem. The issue here
though was it tried too hard because, having found the cause of the problem
(a typo in my original Markdown, which had always existed) it went right
ahead and built a workaround for this one specific broken link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I'm a fan of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Postel's
law&lt;/a&gt;, this is taking
things a bit too far. If this was a real person I'd tasked with the job I
would have expected and encouraged them to come back to me with their
finding and say &lt;em&gt;"dude, the problem is in your input data"&lt;/em&gt; and I'd have
fixed my original Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here though it just went right ahead and added this one weird edge case as
something to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is something to be concerned about and to keep an eye on too. I
feel there's a danger in having the agent rabbit-hole a fix for a problem
that it should simply have reported back to me for further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-never-pushes-back-problem"&gt;The never-pushes-back problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I did find unsurprising but disconcerting was Copilot's
unwillingness to push back, or at least defend its choices. Sometimes it
would make a decision or a change and I'd simply ask it why it had done it
that way, why it had made that choice. Rather than reply with its reasoning
it would pretty much go &lt;em&gt;"yeah, my bad, let me do it a way you're probably
going to find more pleasing"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example of this is one time when I saw some code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;some_property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;blogmore.utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_utility_function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of imports in the body of methods &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; there's a
demonstrable performance reason. I asked Copilot why it had made this choice
here and its reply was simply to say it had gone ahead and changed the code,
moving the import to the top of the module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see plenty of people talk about how working with an agent is like
pair-programming, but I think it misses out on what's got to be the biggest
positive of that approach: the debate and exchange of ideas. This again
feels like a concern to be mindful of, especially if someone less
experienced is bringing code to you where they've used an agent as their
pair buddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-overall-impression"&gt;The overall impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm at the end of the process, and using the result of this experiment
to write this post&lt;sup id="fnref:127-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I feel better informed about what these tools offer,
and the pitfalls I need to be mindful of. Sometimes it wasn't a terrible way
of working. For example, on the first day I started with this, at one point
on a chilly but sunny Sunday afternoon, I was sat on the sofa, MacBook on
lap, guiding an AI to write code, while petting the cat, watching the birds
in the garden enjoy the content of the feeder, all while chatting with my
partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not a terrible way to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I said earlier, I missed the flow state. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;
getting lost in code for a few hours and this is not that. I also found the
constant loop of prompt, wait, review, test, repeat, really quite
exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As best as I can describe it: it feels like the fast food of software
development. It gets the job done, it gets it done fast, but it's really not
fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the process I have a really useful tool, 100% "built with AI",
under my guidance, which lets me &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be creative and build things I
do create by hand. That's not a bad thing, I can see why this is appealing
to people. On the other hand the process of building that tool was pretty
boring and, for want of a better word... soulless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this I have about 24 hours of access to GitHub Copilot Pro left.
It seems this experiment used up my preview time and triggered a &lt;em&gt;"looks
like you're having fun, now you need to decide if you want to buy it"&lt;/em&gt;
response. That's fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I'm left trying to decide if I want to pay to keep it going. At the
level I've been using it at for building BlogMore it looks like it costs
$10/mth. That actually isn't terrible. I spend more than that on other
hobbies and other forms of entertainment. So, if I can work within the
bounds of that tier, it's affordable and probably worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm not sure about yet is if I want to. It's been educational, I can
100% see how and where I'd use this for work (and would of course expect an
employer to foot the bill for it or a similar tool), and I can also see how
and where I might use it to quickly build a personal-use tool to enable
something more human-creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though I think I'm a little better informed thanks to this
process, and better aware of some of the wins people claim, and also better
informed so that I can be rightly incredulous when faced with some of the
wilder claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it'll help put &lt;a href="https://raindrop.io/davep/public-46742255/search/sort=-created&amp;amp;perpage=30&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;search=%23AI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;some of my
reading&lt;/a&gt;
into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:127-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly I &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/issues/117" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;uncovered another
bug&lt;/a&gt; while writing this
post.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:127-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:127-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep saying Copilot, but I think it's probably more correct to say
"Claude Sonnet 4.5" as that's what seemed to be at play under the hood,
if I'm understanding things correctly.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:127-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:127-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course that's an anthropomorphism, you'll find plenty of them
in this article as it's hard not to write about the subject in any other
way; it's an easy shortcut to explain some ideas&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:127-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:127-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually I'm writing this post as I always do: in Emacs. But BlogMore
is in the background serving a local copy of my blog so I can check it
in the browser, and rebuilding it every time I save a change.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:127-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>A new engine</title>
    <updated>2026-02-19T19:20:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html"&gt;about 2 and a half years
now&lt;/a&gt; this blog has been built
with &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
&lt;a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;BlogMore&lt;/a&gt;; a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I'd
love to hear about
it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... that's a blog post to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took lots of notes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>OldNews - A terminal-based client for TheOldReader</title>
    <updated>2026-02-11T17:23:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="OldNews" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/oldnews-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly can't remember when I was first introduced to the idea of
RSS/Atom feeds, and the idea of having an aggregator or reader of some
description to keep up with updates on your favourite sites. It's got to be
over 25 years ago now. I can't remember what I used either, but I remember
using one or two readers that ran locally, right up until I met &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Once I discovered that
I was settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time moved on and I moved from platform to platform, and wandered into
the smartphone era, I stuck with Google Reader (and the odd client for it
here and there). It was a natural and sensible approach to consuming news
and updates. It also mostly felt like a solved problem and so felt nice and
stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, of course, I was annoyed when Google killed it off, &lt;a href="https://killedbygoogle.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;like so many useful
things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happened I dabbled with a couple of alternatives and, at some
point, finally settled on &lt;a href="https://theoldreader.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;TheOldReader&lt;/a&gt;. Since
then it's been my "server" for feed subscriptions with me using desktop and
mobile clients to work against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... I never found anything that worked for me that ran in the terminal.
Given &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/terminal.html"&gt;I've got a thing for writing terminal-based
tools&lt;/a&gt; it made sense I should have a go, and so
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;OldNews&lt;/a&gt; became my winter break project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reading an article in OldNews" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/reading.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written it as a client application for &lt;a href="https://github.com/theoldreader/api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the API of
TheOldReader&lt;/a&gt;, and only for that, and
have developed it in a way that works well for me. All the functionality I
want and need is in there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move subscriptions between folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark read/unread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read articles (that provide actual content in their feeds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there's no support for starring feeds or interacting with the
whole "friend" system (honestly: while I see mention of it in the API, I
know nothing of that side of things and really don't care about it). As time
goes on I might work on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all of my other terminal-based applications, there's a rich command
palette that shows you what you can do, and also what keyboard shortcuts
will run those commands. While I do still need to work on some documentation
for the application (although you'd hope that anyone looking for an RSS
reader at this point would mostly be able to find their way around) the
palette is a good place to go looking for things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The command palette" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/command-palette.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus there's a help screen too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The help screen" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/help.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If themes are your thing, there's themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Available themes" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/themes.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Gruvbox" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/gruvbox.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Textual Light" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/textual-light.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nord" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/nord.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a small selection, and there's more to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the cosmetic front there's a simple compact mode, which toggles
between two ways of showing the navigation menu, the article lists and the
panel headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Not compact" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/not-compact.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Compact" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/11/compact.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OldNews has been a daily-driver for a wee while now, while also under active
development. I think I've covered all the main functions I want and have
also shaken out plenty of bugs, so today's the day to call it v1.0.0 and go
from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a user of TheOldReader and fancy interacting with it from the
terminal too then it's out there to try out. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/oldnews/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPI&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that
has &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and running with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;oldnews
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed using
&lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tool&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;oldnews
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; installed you can use &lt;a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;uvx.sh&lt;/a&gt; to
perform the installation. For GNU/Linux or macOS or similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-LsSf&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uvx.sh/oldnews/install.sh&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or on Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;powershell&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-ExecutionPolicy&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ByPass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-c&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;irm https://uvx.sh/oldnews/install.ps1 | iex&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, run the &lt;code&gt;oldnews&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is useful to someone else; meanwhile I'll be using it more
and more. If you need help, or have any ideas, please feel free to &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;raise an
issue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/discussions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;start a

    <title>Solidarity, Empathy, and Patience -- thinking about code reviews</title>
    <updated>2026-02-04T13:50:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="so-i-saw-this-video"&gt;So I saw this video...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A chiral crystal" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/04/chiral.jpeg#centre" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death Stranding, along with its sequel, is my absolute favourite video game
ever, and probably one of my favourite pieces of fiction ever too; I've
watched and read a lot about the game (not to mention I've &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORDJd_VYhF74e6Mapf8oHp8i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;played both
releases a ton
too&lt;/a&gt;).
A good few months back I was watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_GhSXMMJp0E?si=dGxAJlgLi5BBKCkM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a video about the making of the first
game&lt;/a&gt; and during the
video, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_GhSXMMJp0E?si=z6FKH_FNfFMEozAe&amp;amp;t=1635" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;around the 27:20
mark&lt;/a&gt;, the narrator
says the phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the game's core values of solidarity, empathy, and patience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stood out to me. There was something about that phrase and what it
meant given my experiences in Death Stranding and Death Stranding 2; it
spoke to me enough that I jotted it down and kept coming back to it and
thinking about it. It was a phrase I couldn't get out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time I was also doing a lot of thinking about, and
note-writing about, code reviews. Although I've been working in software
development&lt;sup id="fnref:198-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:198-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for a few decades now (I started in July 1989), I was quite
late to the whole process of code review -- at least in the way we talk
about it today. This mostly comes down to the fact that for a lot of my time
I either worked in very small companies or I was the only developer around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, thinking about my own approach to reviews is something I've only
really been doing for the past few years. I've made personal notes about it,
read posts and articles about it, I've had conversations about it; my
thoughts and feelings about it have drifted a little but seem to have
settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of that phrase from the Death Stranding video crept into this
thought process, as I felt it nicely summed up what a good code review would
look and feel like. Weirdly I also realised that, perhaps, the things I like
and value about Death Stranding are also the things I like, value, and want
to embody when it comes to code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big selling points for me, with Death Stranding, is the
asynchronous multiplayer aspect of it; the reason Kojima calls it a "Strand
type game". I have my game, I have my goal, but other people can indirectly
affect it, either doing work in their game that leaks into mine in a
beneficial way, or by leaking into mine in a way that I have to clean up.
There's something really satisfying about this asynchronous collaboration.
That feels similar to the collective effort of working in a single
repository, each person working on their own branch or PR, sometimes in
tandem, sometimes in series, sometimes to the benefit of each other and
sometimes in ways that block each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the point here. There's a similarity if I think about it, but
I don't want to get too carried away on that line of thought. It's the
phrase from the video I care about; it's the approach of involving
solidarity, empathy and patience I want to think about more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solidarity"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="In the mountains" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/04/mountains.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, for me, is all about where you position yourself when you approach
reviewing code. I sense things only work well if you view the codebase as
something with common ownership. I've worked on and with a codebase where
the original author invited others in to collaborate, but where they
constantly acted as a gatekeeper, and often as a gatekeeper who was
resistant to their own contributions being reviewed, and it was an
exhausting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the key here is to work against a "your code" vs "my standard"
approach, instead concentrating on an "our repository" view. That's not to
say that there shouldn't be standards and that they shouldn't be maintained
-- there should be and they should be -- but more to say that they should be
agreed upon, mutually understood to be worthwhile, and that any callout of a
standard not being applied is seen as a good and helpful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force here should be the shared intent, and how the different
degrees of knowledge and experience can come together to express that
intent. If a reviewer can see issues with a submission, with a proposed
change or addition to the codebase, the ideal approach is to highlight them
in such a way as to make it feel like &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; discovered them, not that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;
discovered them and &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; should sort it out. Depending on the degree of
proposed change, this might actually be expressed by (if you're using
GitHub, for example) using the "Suggested Change" feature to directly feed
back into the PR, or perhaps for something a little more complex, or the
offer to pair up to work on the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="empathy"&gt;Empathy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sam and Fragile" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/04/Sam-and-Fragile.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has written a lot of code, and so written a lot of bugs and
made a lot of bad design choices, I feel empathy is the easiest of the three
words to get behind and understand, but possibly the hardest one to actually
put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at a PR, it's easy to see code, to see those design choices,
and to approach the reading as if you were the one who had written it,
assessing it through that lens. In my own experience, this is where I find
myself writing and re-writing my comments during a review. As much as
possible I try and ask the author &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they've taken a particular approach.
It could be, perhaps, that I've simply missed a different perspective they
have. If that's the case I'll learn something about the code (and about
them); if that isn't the case I've invited them to have a second read of
their contribution. It seems to me that this benefits everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that where I land with this is the idea of striving to act less like
a critic and more like a collaborator, and in doing so aiming to add to an
atmosphere of psychological safety. Nobody should feel like there's a
penalty to getting something "wrong" in a contribution; they should ideally
feel like they've learnt a new "gotcha" to be mindful of in the future (both
as an author and a reviewer). Done right the whole team, and the work,
benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="patience"&gt;Patience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Arriving at the plate gate" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/04/Plate-Gate.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patience aspect of this view of reviews, for me, covers a few things.
There's the patience that should be applied when reading over the code;
there's the patience that should be applied when walking someone through
feedback and suggestions; and there's the patience needed by the whole team
to not treat code reviews as a speed bump on the road to getting work over
the line. While patience applies to other facets of a review too, I think
these are the most important parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a work environment I think it's the last point -- that of the team's
collective patience -- that is the most difficult to embody and protect.
Often we'll find ourselves in a wider environment that employs a myopic view
of progress and &lt;em&gt;getting things done&lt;/em&gt;, where the burn-down chart for the
sprint is all that matters. In that sort of environment a code review can
often be seen, by some, as a frustrating hurdle to moving that little card
across that board. Cards over quality. Cards over sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my belief that this is one of those times where the phrase "slow down
to speed up" really does apply. For me, review time is where the team gets
to grow, to own the project, to own the code, to really apply the
development and engineering principles they want to embody. Time spent on a
review now will, in my experience, collectively save a lot more time later
on, as the team becomes more cohesive and increasingly employs a shared
intuition for what's right for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="this-is-not-entirely-a-post-about-code-reviews"&gt;This is not (entirely) a post about code reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Near the wind farm" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/02/04/Wind-Farm.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with code reviews, or any other team activities, is they don't
exist in a vacuum. They take on the taste and smell of the culture in which
they operate. It's my experience that it doesn't matter how much solidarity,
empathy or patience you display during your day-to-day, if it's counter to
the culture in which you work it's always going to be exhausting, it's
always going to feel like a slog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If leadership in technology, in software engineering, were to show more of
these three basic qualities, they'd start to appear like they realise that
they're working with actual humans, not producers of code; and I think we
need more of that now than at any time in the history of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I first saw that video, and heard that phrase, and had it run around
my head, I've come to feel that it's not just a good mantra for code
reviews; I think it's a simple blueprint for what good tech leadership
should look like. If there was more "Strand-type" leadership in my chosen
industry I feel it would be more open, more accessible, would offer more
psychological safety and ultimately would result in teams, and projects,
that thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TIL - uvx.sh</title>
    <updated>2026-01-27T16:03:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, like a lot of folk in the Python world, I've been
won over by &lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to managing my
own projects my journey over the past few years as been
&lt;a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pipenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, then
&lt;a href="https://rye.astral.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rye&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then when rye was killed off I finally
swapped to &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; (later than I should have, I realised in hindsight). At each
step I've found each tool cleaner, easier to work with and more
feature-rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt in my mind that &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; has done the most work to make
installing Python-based tools (or at least PyPI-based tools) &lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;as
friction-free an experience as
possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I've discovered &lt;a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;uvx.sh&lt;/a&gt;. The thing with &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; is the
person installing your application first needs to get and install &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;; this
site removes that friction. Now if someone wants to install
&lt;a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obs2nlm&lt;/a&gt; (for example) they should be able to
just do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-LsSf&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uvx.sh/obs2nlm/install.sh&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and away they go (assuming they have &lt;a href="https://curl.se" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; installed,
which is generally going to be far more likely than having &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; installed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are &lt;a href="https://www.djm.org.uk/posts/protect-yourself-from-non-obvious-dangers-curl-url-pipe-sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the usual caveats and
concerns&lt;/a&gt;
about the &lt;em&gt;"just pipe this stuff via &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; trust me bro"&lt;/em&gt; approach, but if
you are comfortable with suggesting this kind of install method it looks
worth adding this to an application's installation documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to start mentioning it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>ng2nlm - Feed NotebookLM a Norton Guide</title>
    <updated>2026-01-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After having knocked up &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html"&gt;obs2nlm the other day&lt;/a&gt; I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html"&gt;one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
&lt;a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng2nlm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as &lt;code&gt;obs2nlm&lt;/code&gt;, only it
uses &lt;a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngdb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it seems to be working a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; What are all the numbers in square brackets for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NotebookLM:&lt;/strong&gt; The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source &lt;em&gt;and linking to it&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No citations in the code" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given this, perhaps I can use the
&lt;a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;--additional-instructions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak &lt;code&gt;ng2nlm&lt;/code&gt; itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng2nlm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exists.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>obs2nlm - Feed NotebookLM an Obsidian Vault</title>
    <updated>2026-01-10T11:18:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I've mentioned a couple of times before that I've become quite the
fan of &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. For the past few years, at any given
point, I've had a couple of vaults on the go. Generally I find such vaults a
really useful place to record things I'd otherwise forget, and of course as
a place to go back and look things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... even then, it's easy enough to forget what you might have recorded
and know that you can even go back and look things up. Also I tend to find
that I can't quite figure out a good way of getting a good overview of what
I've recorded, over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile: I've been playing around with Google's
&lt;a href="https://notebooklm.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;NotebookLM&lt;/a&gt; as a tool to help research and
understand various topics. After doing this with my recent winter break
coding project (more on that in the future) I realised I really should get
serious about taking this approach with my Obsidian Vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure this is far from novel, I'm sure lots of people have done similar
things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/vault2source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a few months
ago&lt;/a&gt;, had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so &lt;a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obs2nlm&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html"&gt;I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things&lt;/a&gt; and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in &lt;a href="https://journey.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt; for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in &lt;a href="https://evernote.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;,
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
&lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Textualize&lt;/a&gt;. It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obs2nlm&lt;/a&gt; will be handy for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A Norton Guide collection</title>
    <updated>2025-12-12T17:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned a &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/norton-guide.html"&gt;few times on this blog&lt;/a&gt;, I've
long had a bit of a thing for &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;writing tools for reading the content of
Norton Guide files&lt;/a&gt;. I first used
Norton Guides back in the early 1990s thanks to the release of Clipper 5,
and later on in that decade I wrote my first couple of tools to turn guides
into HTML (and also wrote a Windows-based reader, then rewrote it, wrote one
for OS/2, wrote one for GNU/Linux, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool (&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng2html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) got used by a few
sites on the 'net to publish all sorts of guides, but it's not something I
ever got into doing myself. Amusingly, from time to time, because I had a
credit on those sites as the author of the conversion tool, I'd get random
emails from people hoping I could help them with the topic of whatever guide
they'd been reading. Sometimes I could help, often not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I've recently been told two of the biggest sites for this sort of
thing (they might even have been the same site, or one a copy of the other,
I didn't really dive into them too much and wasn't sure who was behind them
anyway) have long since gone offline. This means that, as far as I can tell,
a huge collection of knowledge from the DOS days is a lot harder to get to,
if it hasn't disappeared altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me kind of sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit to add:&lt;/strong&gt; digging a little, one of the sites was called
&lt;code&gt;www.clipx.net&lt;/code&gt; and it looks to have long-since gone offline. It is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213123739/http://www.clipx.net/ng/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;on
archive.org though&lt;/a&gt;.
The other was &lt;code&gt;x-hacker.org&lt;/code&gt; which, digging a wee bit more, seems to have
been a copy of what was on clipx.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had an idea: having &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/03/24/ng2web.html"&gt;recently polished up my replacement for
ng2html&lt;/a&gt;, why not use that to build my own site
that publishes the guides I have? So I set about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one wrinkle to this though. While the other sites seemed to just
publish every NG file they got their hands on, I'd prefer to try and do it
like this: publish every guide I have in my collection &lt;em&gt;that I have a
licence or permission to publish&lt;/em&gt;; or as near as possible&lt;sup id="fnref:100-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:100-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of this,
&lt;a href="https://norton-guides.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;norton-guides.davep.dev&lt;/a&gt; has been born.
The repository that drives it &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/norton-guides" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;is on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/norton-guides/wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I have a wiki
page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all the guides
I have that I could possibly publish, showing what I know about the
copyright/licence of each one and what the publishing state is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Snapshot of the site" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/12/12/norton-guides.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this, I'm putting out a call for help: if you remember the days of
Norton Guide help files, if you have Norton Guide help files I don't have,
and especially if you are the copyright-holder of any of these files and you
can extend me the permission to open them up, or if you know the right
people and can get me in touch with them, &lt;a href="mailto:davep@davep.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;DROP ME A LINE&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also love to have others join me in this... quest. So if you want to
contribute to the repository and help build it up I'd also love to hear from
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will possibly be a little permissive when it comes to things that I
believe contain public domain information to start with.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:100-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DHV</title>
    <updated>2025-07-19T15:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dhv.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="DHV" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/07/19/dhv-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the very early days of my involvement with
&lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Textualize&lt;/a&gt;, while looking for fun things to
build to test out the framework and find problems with it, I created
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-astview&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was
pretty simple: exercise Textual's
&lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; widget by using it to
display the output of Python's &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;abstract syntax tree
module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the code still works, Textual has moved on a lot, as has my approach
to building applications with Textual, and so I've been wanting to do a
ground-up rewrite of it. At the same time I was also thinking that it might
be interesting to build a tool that provides other ways of understanding how
your Python source gets turned into runnable code; with this in mind I've
ended up building a terminal-based application called DHV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dhv.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="DHV in action" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/07/19/dhv.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is pretty straightforward: you type in, paste in, or load up,
Python code, and you get a real-time display of what the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;resulting
bytecode&lt;/a&gt; and abstract syntax
tree would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wondered what a particular bit of code looks like under the
hood, or wondered if one particular approach to a problem is "more
efficient"&lt;sup id="fnref:71-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:71-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than another, or just wondered to yourself if &lt;code&gt;1+1&lt;/code&gt; ends up
being a complex operation or simply gets turned into &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, this tool might be
useful to experiment and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now DHV only works with Python 3.13. The main reason for this is that
the Python &lt;code&gt;dis&lt;/code&gt; module is a bit of a moving target and has had some
noticeable interface changes over the past few versions. When I find some
time I might work on making DHV a little more backward-compatible. But for
now keep this in mind: when you're looking at the results for some code
you're looking at what Python 3.13 (or later) would do, earlier Pythons may
differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHV is licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/dhv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/dhv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPI&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that has
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dhv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a fan of
&lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and friends
you can install it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;uv tool install --python 3.13 dhv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:71-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure many of us have worked with that person who claims &lt;em&gt;"this is
more efficient"&lt;/em&gt; without providing any evidence; this might just be the
tool to let you check that assertion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:71-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Complexitty</title>
    <updated>2025-04-20T09:30:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Complexitty" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Norton Guide readers&lt;/a&gt; or
the &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories&amp;amp;q=5x5&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;sort=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;5x5
puzzle&lt;/a&gt;,
code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto
exercises. I've written versions in many languages, and messed with plots in
some different environments, as varied as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ytRZrHL34" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in VR on the
web&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Self-Documenting-Mandelbrot-by-davepearson/1341910.0S66D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;wearable
items&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html"&gt;my involvement with
Textualize&lt;/a&gt; I
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/trMandelbrot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;wrote a deliberately worst-approach
version&lt;/a&gt; using that framework. The
whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also
stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on I did &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a second version that targets
Textual&lt;/a&gt;. This time it did a
better job and was the catalyst for building
&lt;a href="https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-canvas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This version was
intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example
application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible
version mentioned above, I still wasn't 100% happy with the way it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I did some maintenance work on &lt;code&gt;textual-canvas&lt;/code&gt;, cleaning up the
repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python
projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at
&lt;code&gt;textual-mandelbrot&lt;/code&gt; and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn't really
sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not
that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick
off a fresh stand-alone application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Complexitty&lt;/a&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Complexitty on startup" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the application has all the same features as the &lt;code&gt;mandelexp&lt;/code&gt;
application that came with &lt;code&gt;textual-mandelbrot&lt;/code&gt;, plus a couple more. Also
it's built on top of &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the common core
library&lt;/a&gt; I've been putting
together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ATODO%20label%3AEnhancement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I'll add more
features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zoomed in with Complexitty" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-red.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with
comprehensive help for commands and key bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The help screen" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-help.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there's also a command palette that helps you discover (and run)
commands and their keyboard bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The command palette" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-commands.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexitty is licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/complexitty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPI&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that has
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;complexitty
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;complexitty&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;complexitty

    <title>ng2web v1.0.0</title>
    <updated>2025-03-24T14:17:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It pretty much all started with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt; * Revision 1.1  1996/02/15 18:57:13  davep
 * Initial revision
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's from the rcs log &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng/blob/master/w3ng.c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;for the source for
&lt;code&gt;w3ng&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tool I wrote so
I could read Norton Guide files in my web browser, served by Apache, running
on my GNU/Linux server in my office. The tool itself was written as a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;CGI&lt;/a&gt; tool (remember
them?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I posted about this to &lt;code&gt;comp.lang.clipper&lt;/code&gt; and pretty quickly some
folk asked if it might be possible to do a version that would write the
whole guide as a collection of HTML files for static hosting, rather than
serving them from a cgi-bin utility. That seemed like a sensible idea and
so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt; * Revision 1.1  1996/03/16 09:49:00  davep
 * Initial revision
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html/blob/master/ng2html.c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng2html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward around a quarter of a century and I decided it would be fun to
write &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/"&gt;a library for Python that reads Norton Guide
files&lt;/a&gt;, and a tool called &lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt; was the
first test I wrote of it, designed as a more flexible replacement for
&lt;code&gt;ng2html&lt;/code&gt;. I've tweaked and tinkered with the tool since I first created it,
but never actually "finished" it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's changed today. I've just released v1.0.0 of &lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A page generated with ng2web" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/24/ng2web.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If turning one or more Norton Guide files into static websites seems like
the sort of thing you want to be doing, &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/ng2web/"&gt;take a look at the
documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt; is licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/ng2web/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that has
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ng2web
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ng2web

    <title>AgiNG v0.3.0</title>
    <updated>2025-03-22T09:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/releases/tag/v0.3.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;just released AgiNG
v0.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. The main focus
of this release was to get some searching added to the application. Similar
to what I added to &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/weg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WEG&lt;/a&gt; back in the day, I
wanted three types of searching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current entry search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current guide-wide search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All registered guides-wide search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current entry search is done with a simple modal input, and for now the
searching is always case-insensitive (I was going to add a switch for this
but it sort of felt unnecessary and I liked how clean the input is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Entry search" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search is started by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;/&lt;/kbd&gt;, and if a hit is found
&lt;kbd&gt;n&lt;/kbd&gt; will take you through all subsequent matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you're not sure of the keys, you'll find them in the help
screen or via the command palette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking up search in the command palette" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search-palette.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guide-wide and all-guide searching is done in the same dialog. To search
guide-wide you enter what you want to find and untick &lt;em&gt;"All Guides"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Setting up a guide search" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-setup.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the search will stick to the current guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Guide-wide search running" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-running.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As will be obvious, searching all guides that have been registered with
AgiNG is as simple as ticking &lt;em&gt;"All Guides"&lt;/em&gt;. Then when you search it'll
take a walk through every entry of every guide you've added to the guide
directory in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gide-wide searching" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-search.gif#centre" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global searching is accessed with &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;/&lt;/kbd&gt; or via the
command palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Finding global search" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/22/global-palette.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this added, I think that's most of the major functionality I wanted for
AgiNG. I imagine there's a few more tweaks I'll think of (for example: I
think adding regex search to the global search screen could be handy), but I
don't think there's any more big features it needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AgiNG can be installed with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; or (ideally) &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;from
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;aging&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;aging
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/aging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;source is available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>AgiNG</title>
    <updated>2025-03-12T08:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AgiNG" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems I really do still have this need to create new terminal-based
projects at the moment. There's been
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/01/03/braindrop.html"&gt;Braindrop&lt;/a&gt;, then
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/01/25/peplum.html"&gt;Peplum&lt;/a&gt;, then after that came
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/02/14/hike.html"&gt;Hike&lt;/a&gt;. While I'm still tweaking and adding to them,
and also using them to refine &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a wee library I'm building up that forms the
core of my latest apps&lt;/a&gt;, I felt I
still had this one app that I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to finally build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1990s I've had this mild obsession with &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;building tools for
maintaining access to Norton Guide
files&lt;/a&gt;. I've written readers for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/eg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GNU/Linux (which also works on macOS too)&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;OS/2&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/weg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GNU
Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, and also or the web (in multiple
incarnations). Those builds have covered a few languages, including C, C++,
Pascal, JavaScript and Emacs Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd never written a Python library or application for it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I first saw Textual mentioned in passing on Twitter a few years
back, way back in the 0.1 days, I thought that could be the thing that would
push me over the edge. In anticipation of that, back in 2021, I initially
developed &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngdb.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a library
that provides the core Norton Guide reading code for Python applications and
could form the basis for other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a test for this I then wrote &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(which works, but I think still needs a bit of tidying up -- something I'm
aiming to do in the next few weeks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the journey with Textual itself &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html"&gt;kicked
off&lt;/a&gt;, happened, and &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html"&gt;came to an
end&lt;/a&gt;; and yet somehow I'd never got
round to building the thing I'd initially looked at Textual for: a
terminal-based Norton Guide reader that looked nice and modern (by terminal
standards). When I initially joined Textualize the owner had actually said
they wanted me to build this as test of the framework, to essentially start
out by employing me to create some Free Software that would help dogfood the
library, but that seemed to get forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the start of this month and I finally felt it was time to
tackle this. The result is &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/aging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;AgiNG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:184-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:184-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AgiNG in action" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-dark.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of v0.1.0 it has most of the features you'd expect from a usable Norton
Guide reader, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ability to add guide files to an in-application directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability open and navigate a guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full see-also support, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full translation of characters as were under MS-DOS into the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to copy entry text or source to the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to copy save entry text or source to a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to a guide's credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AgiNG showing a long entry" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-long-entry.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need to write some proper documentation for the application, but
meanwhile all commands and key shortcuts can be discovered either via the
help screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AgiNG help" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-help-screen.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or by pulling up the command palette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AgiNG command palette" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-command-palette.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the workings of the application will be fairly obvious to anyone
who is familiar with Norton Guide files; if anything isn't making sense &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I'm
more than happy to answer
questions&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/ideas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;take suggestions for
improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wee feature I want to call out, that I felt was important to add, was a
"classic view" facility. The thing with Norton Guide files is they were
mostly created in the very late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s. People would
often get creative with the colouring within them, but in many cases the
colouring assumed the default Norton Guide application. Its colours were
white text on a blue background. So sometimes other colouring was done
assuming that background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of this here, with an entry in a guide being viewed
using the default &lt;code&gt;textual-dark&lt;/code&gt; theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Entry in textual-dark" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/textual-dark.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the colouring in the syntax section. This is more obvious if the
application is switched to one of the light themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Entry in solarized-light" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/solarized-light.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a nod to this issue in mind, I added the "classic view" for entries
(which is a sticky setting -- turn it on and it stays on until you turn it
off):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Classic view in action" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/classic-view.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little hard on the eyes, I think, but also filled with nostalgia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking of themes, all the usual application themes are available, here's a
wee selection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nord" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-nord.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Textual Light" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-light.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Gruvbox" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-gruvbox.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Solarize Light" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-solarized-light.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Monokai" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-monokai.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AgiNG is licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/aging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that has
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;aging
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;aging&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;aging
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect to see more updates in the near future; as with other recent projects
this is very much something I'm going to be dabbling with and improving as
time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:184-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're wondering about the name, it's nothing more than a word that
happens to have &lt;code&gt;NG&lt;/code&gt; in it, and also a mild pun about this being an
ageing hypertext help system; with the spelling acknowledging Peter
Norton's nationality.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:184-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>MkDocs/mkdocstrings 404 CSS TIL update</title>
    <updated>2025-02-28T22:23:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following on from &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/02/28/documenting-fspicker.html"&gt;my post this
morning&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the problem I was
having with &lt;code&gt;_mkdocstrings.css&lt;/code&gt; being 404 any time I deployed by
documentation, build with &lt;code&gt;mkdocs&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;mkdocstrings&lt;/code&gt;, to GitHub Pages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's come to light that I was doing this on hard mode, pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While trying to figure out the best way of deploying the docs, I'd stumbled
on &lt;code&gt;ghp-import&lt;/code&gt; and had been using that. On the other hand, MkDocs has it's
own command for doing the same thing: &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdocs
gh-deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothée &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742#discussioncomment-12351028" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pointed out to
me&lt;/a&gt;
that he never runs into this problem, but he used this command. As it turns
out, if you use &lt;code&gt;mkdocs gh-deploy&lt;/code&gt; it creates the &lt;code&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt; file by
default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does it do this? It uses the &lt;code&gt;ghp-import&lt;/code&gt; code &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/4c7404485f988f409ccaf42fefe705222ff5965a/mkdocs/commands/gh_deploy.py#L138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;and uses a switch it
has to achieve exactly
this&lt;/a&gt;.
In fact... the command line version even has a switch for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-n, --no-jekyll      Include a .nojekyll file in the branch.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is off by default, when you run the command itself, but I wish I'd
noticed this when I was first experimenting. O_o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks to Timothée's pointers, I've now managed to &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/pull/39/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;simplify how I
build and publish the docs from
&lt;code&gt;textual-fspicker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
and I'll apply this to other projects too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Documenting textual-fspicker (plus a TIL)</title>
    <updated>2025-02-28T11:45:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just made a wee update to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-fspicker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, my dialog
library for &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Textual&lt;/a&gt; which adds &lt;code&gt;FileOpen&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;FileSave&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SelectDirectory&lt;/code&gt; dialogs. There's no substantial change to
the workings of the library itself, but I have added something it's been
lacking for a long time: documentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... that's not quite true, it's always had documentation. I'm an avid
writer of Python docstrings and I make a point of always writing them for
every class, function, method or global value as I write the code. As such
the low-level "API" documentation has always been sat there ready to be
published somehow, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the description for how to use the library was mostly a pointer to
some example code inside the README. Not ideal, and something I really
wanted to improve at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given I'm still on a bit of a coding spree in my spare time, I finally
decided to get round to using the amazing
&lt;a href="https://mkdocstrings.github.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mkdocstrings&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with
&lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mkdocs&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/"&gt;get some better documentation up an
running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach I decided to take with the documentation was to &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/using/"&gt;have a page
that gave some general information on how to use the
library&lt;/a&gt; and then also
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/library-contents/base_dialog/"&gt;generate low-level documentation for the all the useful content of the
library from the
docstrings&lt;/a&gt;.
While latter isn't really useful to anyone wanting to use the library in
their own applications, it could be useful to anyone wanting to understand
how it hangs together at a lower-level, perhaps because they want to
contribute to or extend the library in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing some of the general guide took a bit of work, of course, the
work to get the documentation up and running and generating was simple
enough. The effort comes down to 3 rules in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/blob/ad6818c96816f2f1ad7a39909d276271af3f760d/Makefile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
for the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;##############################################################################&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Documentation.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.PHONY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Generate the system documentation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;mkdocs&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;build

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.PHONY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rtfm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;rtfm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Locally read the library documentation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;mkdocs&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;serve

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.PHONY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;publishdocs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;publishdocs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Set up the docs for publishing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;run&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ghp-import&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--push&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;site
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rtfm&lt;/code&gt; target is useful for locally-serving the documentation so I can
live preview as I write things and update the code. The &lt;code&gt;publishdocs&lt;/code&gt; target
is used to create and push a &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch for the repository, resulting
in the documentation being hosted by GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-wee-problem"&gt;A wee problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/02/28/mkdocs-gh-pages-redux.html"&gt;I've since found out there's an easier way of fixing the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, however, where I ran into a wee problem. I noticed that the
locally-hosted version of the documentation looked great, but the version
hosted on GitHub Pages was... not so great. I was seeing a load of text
alignment issues, and also whole bits of text just not appearing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what I was seeing locally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Good layout" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/28/good.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here's what I was seeing being served up from GitHub Pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad layout" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/28/bad.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in the "bad" version the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; label is missing from the
header, and the &lt;code&gt;Parameters&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Returns&lt;/code&gt; tables look quite messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a little bit of time digging and, looking in Safari's console, I
then noticed that I was getting a 404 on a file called &lt;code&gt;_mkdocstrings.css&lt;/code&gt;
in the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; folder. Problem found!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only... was it though? If I looked in the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; local branch the file
was there (and with fine permissions). If I looked in the remote branch, it
was there too. Thinking it could be some odd browser problem I even tried to
grab the file back from the command line and it came back 404 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Testing from the command line" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/28/http-grab.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it was getting kind of late so I decided I must have screwed
up somehow but I should leave it for the evening and head to bed. Before
doing so though &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I decided to drop a question into the mkdocstrings
discussions to see if anyone could see where I'd messed
up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it looked like I hadn't messed up and the reply from the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pawamoy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;always super-helpful Timothée&lt;/a&gt; was, in effect,
&lt;em&gt;"yeah, that should work fine"&lt;/em&gt;. At least I wasn't the only one confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this morning and, with breakfast and coffee inside me, I
decided to try and methodically get to the bottom of it. I &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742#discussioncomment-12348912" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;wrote up the
current state of
understanding&lt;/a&gt;
and looked at what might be the common cause. The thing that stood out to me
was that this was a file that started with an underscore, so I did a quick
search for &lt;em&gt;"github pages underscore"&lt;/em&gt; and right away landed on &lt;a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2022/11/08/how-to-use-underscores-with-github-pages/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;this
result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That had to be it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of testing later and sure enough, the documentation hosted on
GitHub Pages looked exactly like the locally-hosted version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, TIL: by default sites hosted by GitHub Pages will pretend that any asset
that starts with an underscore doesn't exist, unless you have a &lt;code&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt;
in the root of the repository, on the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch (or whatever branch
you decide to serve from).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this all work I added &lt;code&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/tree/ad6818c96816f2f1ad7a39909d276271af3f760d/docs/source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docs/source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and added this to &lt;code&gt;mkdocs.yml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;exclude_docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;!.nojekyll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I've worked out a simple workflow for using &lt;code&gt;mkdocs&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;mkdocstrings&lt;/code&gt;
for my own Python projects, in conjunction with GitHub Pages, I guess I'll
start to sprinkle it over other projects too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Hike</title>
    <updated>2025-02-14T09:22:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hike" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The run of writing new terminal-based tools that I want still keeps going.
First there was &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/01/03/braindrop.html"&gt;Braindrop&lt;/a&gt;, then there was
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/01/25/peplum.html"&gt;Peplum&lt;/a&gt;, and now, released today, there's
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/hike" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Hike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hike is yet another terminal-based Markdown browser. While it's far from the
first, and unlikely to be the last, it's mine and it looks and works exactly
how I need. Perhaps it'll be your sort of thing too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hike viewing its README" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-in-action.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initial release has a bunch of handy features, including things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A command line where file names, URLs and commands can be entered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A persistent history for the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A local file browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple bookmarking system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A browsing history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commands for quickly loading and viewing files held on GitHub, GitLab,
  Codeberg and Bitbucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there's a lot to discover in the application, I've tried to make the help
screen as comprehensive as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hike help" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-help.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there's also the command palette to help with discovering commands and
the keys that are associated with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The command palette in action" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-command-palette.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, themes are supported so no matter your taste you should find
something that's easy on your eyes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dark" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-textual-dark.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Light" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-textual-light.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Tokyo Night" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-tokyo-night.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Solarized Light" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-solarized-light.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hike is licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/hike" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/hike/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that has
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hike
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;hike&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hike
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect to see more updates in the near future; this is very much an ongoing
tinker project.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Peplum</title>
    <updated>2025-01-25T14:21:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Peplum" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to be back in the swing of writing handy (for me) little
terminal-based applications again. Having not long since &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2025/01/03/braindrop.html"&gt;released
Braindrop&lt;/a&gt; (which I'm still working on and
tinkering with; it'll get more features in the near future, for sure), I had
an idea for another tool I'd like to have: something for looking through,
searching, and filtering &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Python PEPs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with anyone who is interested in what's happening with Python itself, I
subscribe to the RSS feed of the latest Python PEPs, but I also wanted
something that would let me look back at older ones in a way that worked
&lt;em&gt;"just so"&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;"just so" being "what feels right for me"&lt;/em&gt;, of course). Having
finished the main work on Braindrop I realised that the general layout of
its UI would work here, as would the filtering and searching approach I
used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this idea &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/peplum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Peplum&lt;/a&gt; was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Peplum in action" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first release I've simply concentrated on all things to do with
grabbing the list of PEPs and presenting them in a useful way; adding
various forms of filtering them; adding the ability to search the metadata;
that sort of thing. I aim to keep developing this out over the next few
weeks and months, adding things like the ability to make notes, to locally
view the text of a PEP, perhaps even to mark PEPs as unread and read, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, much of the design was driven by what I did with
Braindrop, so once again I've tried my very best to make it
keyboard-friendly and as much as possible keyboard-first. This sometimes
means having to work against how Textual works, but generally that isn't too
tricky to do. I'm once again making heavy use of the command palette and
also ensuring that all commands that have corresponding keyboard bindings
are documented in the help screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Peplum Help" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-help.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's enough common code between Peplum and Braindrop, when it comes to
this aspect of building a Textual application, that I'm minded to spin it
out into a little library of its own. I'm going to sit on this code for a
wee while and see how it develops, but I can see me taking this approach
with future applications and doing this will stop the need to copy and
paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also be useful to others building with Textual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also as with Braindrop, themes are a thing, and the theme setting is sticky
so you can set it the once and stick with that you like. Here's some
examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nord" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-nord.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Catppuccin Latte" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-catppuccin-latte.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Tokyo Night" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-tokyo-night.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on this project I managed to find a couple more bugs in
Textual, including &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5488" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a fun way to get &lt;code&gt;transparent&lt;/code&gt; backgrounds to get out of
sync&lt;/a&gt; and also a way to
get &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5489" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;an easy crash out of &lt;code&gt;OptionList&lt;/code&gt; if it's set to &lt;code&gt;width:
auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was even more fun was I sort of &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/113843011699020404" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;discovered a bug in the Python PEP
API&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to
&lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@hugovk@mastodon.social" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; noticing my &lt;em&gt;"huh,
weird"&lt;/em&gt; post on Fosstodon, there's &lt;a href="https://github.com/python/peps/issues/4211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;now an issue for
it&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://github.com/python/peps/pull/4226" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a PR in the
works&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect I should
have raised an issue myself; instead I fell into that &lt;em&gt;"they obviously know
what they're doing so it must be like this for a reason"&lt;/em&gt; trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson relearned: it's always better to ask and get an answer, than to
assume a thing is how it is for a reason you don't know; which I guess is a
version of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Linus' law&lt;/a&gt; really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out and
there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/peplum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/peplum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that
has &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;peplum
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;peplum&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;peplum
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be making good use of this and working on it more; I hope it's
useful to someone else. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Braindrop</title>
    <updated>2025-01-03T16:24:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Braindrop" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-social-banner.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A touch over a year ago I did the initial work on an application called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Tinboard&lt;/a&gt;, a terminal-based client for
the Pinboard bookmarking service. I had a lot of fun building it and it was
an application that I used on a near-daily basis. However, around August
last year &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/08/18/paindrop.html"&gt;I realised it was time for me to move on from Pinboard and try
something new&lt;/a&gt;; based on various recommendations
I settled on &lt;a href="https://raindrop.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Raindrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/08/18/paindrop.html"&gt;in the other blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Raindrop
offered more or less everything I had with Pinboard and so the move was
fairly straightforward. The one thing that was missing though was an
application similar to Tinboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, late on last year, with my winter break approaching, I decided to start
from scratch and build a &lt;em&gt;"Tinboard for Raindrop"&lt;/em&gt;, which I'm calling
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Braindrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a bit of an adventure too. Since &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html"&gt;being laid off from
Textualize earlier in 2024&lt;/a&gt; I'd not
been following its development quite as closely as I used to, and had also
run into some issues and bugs with it since that time; moreover, as well as
various bugs appearing, some breaking changes had also been made. As such
this was going to be a process where I'd wrap my head around what's happened
with the framework over the prior six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all this, over the past couple of weeks I've been spending a few hours
a day doing some for-pleasure coding and v0.1.0 of Braindrop is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Main display" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-main.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as possible I've tried to keep the look and feel similar to that of
Tinboard, while also doing my best to avoid some of the &lt;em&gt;"ah, I wish I
hadn't done it this way"&lt;/em&gt; design decisions I'd made. As of the time of
writing I'm very pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The edit dialog" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-edit.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I did want to do is ensure that the application was as
keyboard-friendly as possible, while also still allowing use of the mouse.
Textual can sometimes get that wrong and I ran into an example of this while
trying to ensure that there's good in-application help. Somewhat recently
Textual added a built-in help system which, sadly, can't easily be used by
and navigated by someone using the keyboard. So instead I've recreated the
help system I built into Tinboard, while adopting the documentation standard
that Textual had settled on (which, coincidentally, was kind of similar to
what I did in Tinboard to start with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The help dialog" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-help.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Tinboard, I've also made sure to make full use of the command
palette, with every action that makes sense having a keyboard hotkey as well
as a command in the palette. I also took things a little further and made
sure that the hotkeys are shown in the command palette for easier discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The command palette" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-command-palette.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also made sure that Textual's new theme system is available for easy
use; so out goes dark/light mode toggling and in comes a collection of
different themes. Here's a wee selection as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Example theme 1" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-1.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Example theme 2" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-2.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Example theme 3" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-3.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Example theme 4" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a few more things I want to do before I consider the application
v1.0-ready, but it's already in use by me and working well. As I decide what
else I want to add to it &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATODO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I'm building up a list of TODO
items&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that my day job these days is quite varied, isn't quite so
coding-intensive, and isn't always related to all things Python, it's
actually been fun to sit down and hack up a pure Python application from
scratch again. It's also helped me discover a couple or so fresh bugs in
Textual (which &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/created_by/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I've
reported&lt;/a&gt;, of
course) and given me the opportunity to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pulls/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;PR some trivial fixes as I've
noticed typos and stuff as I
go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/braindrop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;via
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that
has &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;braindrop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be installed with
&lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by tapping &lt;code&gt;davep/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; and then installing &lt;code&gt;braindrop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep/homebrew
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;braindrop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Markdown all the things</title>
    <updated>2024-11-04T21:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been on a bit of a &lt;em&gt;"turn stuff into Markdown files and slap
them in an Obsidian Vault"&lt;/em&gt; trip. This kicked off a couple of months back
when I made a decision unrelated to coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On and off, since my teenage years, I've kept journals. Since those teenage
years it's been more off than on, but a couple of times in my adult life
it's been really helpful to actually write one. The last time this happened
was early 2019. It was pretty vital I did that at the time and it was a
really sensible and helpful decision, and an approach to the situation I was
in that I'd recommend to anyone (and have done on occasion to anyone going
through the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual motivation for starting that particular journal is long behind
me, but I'd got into the habit of writing it and so, until a couple or so
months back, I kept jotting something down every day. But I came to the
realisation that I didn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to and that it had become something of a
chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd been using an application called &lt;a href="https://journey.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt;. It's
a great app, does the job well, but was also suffering from the creep of
"AI" (I've had a few apps ion my arsenal that don't need it, acquire a
useless "AI" feature). This privacy-problematic change of direction,
combined with the realisation that I didn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to write about my day,
every day, any more, made me decide it was time to stop and cancel the
subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Journey has a pretty comprehensive export option so I used it and
didn't think too much more about it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I also had a subscription to &lt;a href="https://evernote.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; that
I didn't really use any more. Within it I had held a handful of years of
journal entries from a decade or so ago, along with other &lt;em&gt;"remember this
for some point in the future"&lt;/em&gt; stuff. For the longest time I was on some
really cheap tier that didn't exist any more, one that was low enough that I
didn't really notice the cost go out each month so I kept putting off
exporting things and closing it all down until &lt;em&gt;"next month"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got an email from them to say they were forcing me onto some new tier
that was more expensive. So that was the final straw there. I made an export
of what I had in Evernote and closed that account down too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wee while went past and then I got to thinking that it might be
interesting to try and combine both these sources into one archived journal.
I had stuff from around 2010 to 2015, and I also had stuff from 2019 until
2024; the former in the Evernote archive and the latter in the Journey
archive. Surely I could write a couple of tools to turn that data into one
consolidated Obsidian Vault?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a couple of weekends
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/journey2md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;journey2md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/evernote2md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;evernote2md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were born. While both
of those tools work differently, they're both designed to populate the same
Obsidian Vault. Once I was happy with this I did the mass conversion and I
was happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have years of journal entries, all converted to Markdown files and
made available for reading via an application that lets me rummage through
history using dates and tags and all sorts of other searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was happy with that and didn't give it much more though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last week I got to thinking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has turned into the worst place possible and I can't for the life of
me think why any right-thinking person who has an ounce of humanity or has
anything approaching a humanistic outlook on life would remain an active
user. Honestly I stuck it out longer than was sensible, but in June 2023 I
finally quit for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new owner was
confirmed&lt;/a&gt;
I, like a lot of people, extracted my archive. It's since been sat in
storage doing nothing, yet there's a lot of data in there that could be
interesting to work with, or just to go back and look through. So last
week's thought was &lt;em&gt;"why don't I also turn this into an Obsidian Vault?"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The graph of my Twitter Obsidian Vault" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2024/11/04/bird2glass.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool I built to do this is
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/bird2glass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;bird2glass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As you'll see in &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/bird2glass/blob/main/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the
README&lt;/a&gt; it makes a
few assumptions about the state of Twitter archive dumps and also what a
user wants from this. Personally I'm pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main aim of the tool is to break the tweets down into a hierarchy of
year, month and day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Viewing a tweet" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2024/11/04/tweet-view.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and also to connect them with any account that was being replied to or
mentioned in some way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Viewing a user" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2024/11/04/user-view.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This user view is handy when viewing backlinks, as it gives you a list of
all the tweets that mention that user (and, of course, if you're into
Obsidian's graph it will make for some interesting connections within
there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sense there's more I can do with this, and I imagine I will continue to
tinker with it. Meanwhile though, if that sounds like something you'd
benefit from do feel free to grab it and play with it and hack on it. Keep
in mind the notes and assumptions that are in the README, and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be
prepared for a lot of files to be created if you did a lot of tweeting like
I did (I do think that over 50,000 individual files for an Obsidian Vault is
a bit silly, if I'm honest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... I might need to look at other applications and think about how
I can turn the data into useful Markdown collections!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
