    <title>I must be getting old</title>
    <updated>2022-08-23T21:31:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little earlier this evening I got &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/issues/7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a new
issue&lt;/a&gt; raised against
&lt;a href="(https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/issues/7)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;boxquote.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently
Emacs 29 (I'm running 28.1 as of the time of writing) is moaning about the
likes of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;some-location-or-other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;buffer-string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a whole background to why I've tended to code like that, that stems
from enjoying Common Lisp, my days reading (and sometimes posting to)
&lt;code&gt;comp.lang.lisp&lt;/code&gt;, and I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; some of the stuff &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Naggum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Erik
Naggum&lt;/a&gt; wrote back in the day. I
won't get into it all now; I'm not sure I can even remember a lot of how I
got there given how far back it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanting to quickly get to the bottom of why the above was suddenly an issue,
I dived into the &lt;code&gt;NEWS&lt;/code&gt; file and &lt;a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/67a15ce1564ce35ece24a19f00e03a36e0575746/etc/NEWS#L2585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;found the
following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;** Many seldom-used generalized variables have been made obsolete.
Emacs has a number of rather obscure generalized variables defined,
that, for instance, allowed you to say things like:

   (setf (point-min) 4)

These never caught on and have been made obsolete.  The form above,
for instance, is the same as saying

   (narrow-to-region 4 (point-max))

The following generalized variables have been made obsolete:
&amp;#39;buffer-file-name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;buffer-local-value&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;buffer-modified-p&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;buffer-name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;buffer-string&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;buffer-substring&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;current-buffer&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;current-column&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;current-global-map&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;current-input-mode&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;current-local-map&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;current-window-configuration&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;default-file-modes&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;documentation-property&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;frame-height&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;frame-visible-p&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;global-key-binding&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;local-key-binding&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mark&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;mark-marker&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;marker-position&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mouse-position&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;point&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;point-marker&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;point-max&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;point-min&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;read-mouse-position&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;screen-height&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;screen-width&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;selected-frame&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;selected-screen&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;selected-window&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;standard-case-table&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;syntax-table&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;visited-file-modtime&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;window-height&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;window-width&amp;#39;, and
&amp;#39;x-get-secondary-selection&amp;#39;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As suggested above... this is my thing, this is how I coded some Elisp
stuff. Look through much of my &lt;a href="https://elisp.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Emacs Lisp code&lt;/a&gt; and
you'll find me &lt;code&gt;setf&lt;/code&gt;ing stuff all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently my style is "obscure". Actually, I'm kinda okay with that if I'm
honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a bit of a pain in the arse; I'm going to have to go
through a whole bunch of code and make it "less obscure", at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the part that had me thinking I must be getting old. Oh no. The
&lt;code&gt;NEWS&lt;/code&gt; file had another little surprise in store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;** The quickurl.el library is now obsolete.
Use &amp;#39;abbrev&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;skeleton&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;tempo&amp;#39; instead.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That.... that's me that is. Well, it's one of the me things. If you run
&lt;code&gt;about-emacs&lt;/code&gt;, dive into &lt;code&gt;Authors&lt;/code&gt;, and search for my name, in any copy of
GNU Emacs from the last decade or two, you'll find this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dave Pearson: wrote 5x5.el quickurl.el
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/quickurl.el/blob/master/quickurl.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;quickurl.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
was a package I wrote back in the late 1990s, back when I was a very heavy
user of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt;, and often found
myself posting the same URLs in posts again and again; especially in
&lt;code&gt;comp.lang.clipper&lt;/code&gt;. As a fairly quick hack I wrote the code so that I could
very quickly insert often-used URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time later, I got an email from the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;FSF&lt;/a&gt; (I actually
think it was from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt; --
but that's an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mbox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I've long ago
lost -- or a backup of it might be in storage back in England, on a DVD),
asking if I wanted to contribute it to Emacs proper. This seemed like an odd
thing to add to Emacs but, sure, why the hell not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I had my second contribution to a body of code I used a lot (the
first being &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;5x5.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -- which itself was
my first ever attempt at writing some non-trivial Elisp code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... yeah... here we are. I'm now old enough to have written some Emacs
Lisp code, had it required by the FSF for inclusion in Emacs, had it live in
there for something like two decades, and then &lt;em&gt;become obselete&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>My journey to the dark side is complete</title>
    <updated>2020-06-14T20:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since the whole business of "light mode" and "dark mode" really kicked
off in the mobile OS world, I've been a fan of the dark modes. On both
Android and iOS/iPadOS, when apps became available with dark modes, I'd
switch to it. When the operating systems themselves adopted the switch,
that's what I went for. As well as having a love for all things black
(anyone who knows me personally will know that), I think it just looks
better on mobile devices. I can't quite say why, but it just works best for
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when macOS got a supported dark mode, I instantly switched it on,
obviously. Then, within a day, I switched it back to light mode.
Surprisingly it just didn't work for me, and I wasn't sure why. Since then
I've tried living with it a few times and it's rarely lasted more than a few
hours. There was something, something I couldn't quite put my finger on,
that didn't sit right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Monday I decided to give it another go. This time, however, I thought
I'd figured it out. The "problem" was Emacs! As mentioned &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/01/11/where-i-live-and-work.html"&gt;back in
January&lt;/a&gt;,
for as long as I've used it (so since the mid-1990s), my Emacs has always
had a light background -- probably because that's how it came "out of the
box" (I'm talking Emacs in graphical mode here; I started with it on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#1994%E2%80%931996:_The_%22Warp%22_years" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;OS/2
Warp&lt;/a&gt;
and then moved to a GNU/Linux X-based desktop). I figured that the contrast
between the colour scheme of Emacs, and the rest of the machine, was the
issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my working day either in Emacs, or in
&lt;a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; -- often rapidly switching between the
two. I've always run iTerm2 in the usual dark background mode with light
text. So I figured the problem was having a dark OS desktop, dark terminal,
and then a light editing environment. Eventually that'd feel wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided that, for the first time in about 25 years, I should give Emacs
a go with a dark mode. Taking a quick look at &lt;a href="https://pawelbx.github.io/emacs-theme-gallery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;popular dark
themes&lt;/a&gt; I noticed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sanityinc-tomorrow-night&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
looked easy on the eye, so I gave that a go (actually, I gave each of the
themes in that set a go, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/commit/07f1c4c4c8c0c476f1e5e34845a834956d2be0c4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;initially starting with
&lt;code&gt;sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
but I finally settled on &lt;code&gt;sanityinc-tomorrow-night&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with it didn't look too good; not because of a problem with the
theme itself, but because, over time, I'd made changes and tweaks to my
setup that assumed I'd be using my usual light theme. After some dabbling
and tinkering and trying things out, I got it looking "just so".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2020-06-14 at 19.40.43.png" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2020/06/14/Screenshot 2020-06-14 at 19.40.43.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got that working, I then thought it would be nice to be able to have
Emacs -- at least on restart -- adapt to me switching between dark and light
mode on macOS. It turns out that detecting if macOS is in dark mode is easy
enough, the command &lt;code&gt;defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle&lt;/code&gt; will emit &lt;code&gt;Dark&lt;/code&gt;
if in dark mode. So, knowing that, I updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/is-a.el/blob/2b3eb99a213454536d789325f01477e3ce7eec87/is-a.el#L67-L70" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;my personal package for
checking things about the environment that Emacs is in to use that
information&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defconst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is-a-macOS-dark-mode-window-p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is-a-macOS-window-p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;string=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell-command-to-string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Dark\n&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Are we running in a macOS window in dark mode?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as of now, my Emacs setup is such that, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/f8389ac8f93b66c614ef82705929b86f01efc130/init.d/init-style.el#L15-L24" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;if I'm in graphical mode on
macOS and I'm in dark mode, Emacs will use a dark theme, otherwise it'll do
what it did before -- with a light background in a graphical mode and a more
Borland-a-like blue background when in CHUI
mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to have made a difference. Almost one week on my work Macbook is
still in dark mode, and I've switched both of my personal Macbooks, and my
iMac, into dark mode too. I think it's sticking this time. Next up is to
give some serious consideration to darkening the web in general. Only now am
I noticing just how damn bright most of it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a slight aside to the above, I've also made one other change to Emacs:
I've finally dropped the display of scroll bars. In the themes I'm using
they didn't look so great, appearing to be distracting. For the past 25
years I've had the scrollbars there, but never actually &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; them; all
they've ever done is serve as a visual aid to where I am in a file. Thing
is, I'm not sure I ever really pay that much attention to that either. So,
as a test, I've also been running with them turned off and, so far, I'm
really not noticing them been gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habits we form that we convince ourselves make sense...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Some more ~/.emacs.d evolution</title>
    <updated>2020-06-07T16:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I started with this version of the blog on Hashnode&lt;sup id="fnref:171-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:171-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my plan was to
try and write something at least once a week. I managed to do that as far as
January this year, give or take, but then things got a little busy, the
world got trickier, and... Well, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;you don't need me to tell you about
that&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, I'm back to
write some more and, hopefully, try and keep up with writing. I feel it'll
do me good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been busy since January. Work has, as far as possible, carried on as
normal. The only big difference being I'm back working from home. It's an
odd turn of events personally given that I'd worked from home for 21 years,
then (with some trepidation) &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html"&gt;went back to working in an
office&lt;/a&gt;. Having got used to being in
an office and being around people, it took some adjusting to working alone
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on to the main point of this post... During that period I've spent a lot
more time at my machine than I would normally, and so it was inevitable that
I'd end up tinkering with &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;my Emacs
configuration&lt;/a&gt;. While it's true that
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/11/23/visual-evolution-of-emacs-config.html"&gt;there's hardly a week goes by where I don't tinker with some small
thing&lt;/a&gt;, I try not to make
huge changes too often. Huge changes do happen though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of weeks back was another one of those times where I made a big
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html"&gt;burnt my original &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file back in
2016&lt;/a&gt; I've had an approach
where I've tried to make things as modular as possible, and as easy to clone
down to a new machine as possible. The design I came up with, &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html"&gt;especially
once I moved over to using
&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has
served me well. But there was always one thing that bothered me: the files
that handled the loading and configuration of packages were, in effect,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/tree/728e74376bf5606d9ef2d297e36cc2d35e159d64/init.d/packages" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;still three large monolithic
files&lt;/a&gt;.
While this was better than a single monolithic &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs&lt;/code&gt;, it still didn't
feel quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving it a bit of thought, I decided that what I really wanted was a single
directory in which I could drop lots of small &lt;code&gt;.el&lt;/code&gt; files that would handle
the loading and configuration of all sorts of packages. While it didn't gain
anything concrete, the idea felt tidier. Tidy is good. Feeling like the code
smell is good, is good too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First though I needed a way to load multiple files, ideally within a whole
directory hierarchy, without needing to know in advance what files would be
there. After a little bit of tinkering I settled on &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/c3d53152b1adc9ba5e43baddb986870b3244b113/init.d/init-packages.el#L42-L46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;this bit of
code&lt;/a&gt;
that revolves around the use of
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Contents-of-Directories.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;directory-files-recursively&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;expand-file-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;init.d/packages.d/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user-emacs-directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;file-exists-p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cl-loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;directory-files-recursively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;rx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;.el&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;eol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;file-name-sans-extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, this code finds every file in and below
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/tree/master/init.d/packages.d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/init.d/packages.d/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
whose name ends in &lt;code&gt;.el&lt;/code&gt; (note the use of a regular expression, using
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/12/01/being-phony-and-lispy-regular-expressions.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to create it), removes the extension from the name, and loads it with &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt;
(dropping the extension means &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; can decide if it wants to load the
compiled version of the code, or the source, depending on what's available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing that I could then start to populate
&lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/init.d/packages.d/&lt;/code&gt; with lots of smaller files that handled the
loading of packages. In some cases there's a file just for one package, in
other cases there's a file that handles a logical grouping of packages
(where there are obvious direct dependencies, or where one package is
designed to extend the other, etc). For now I've decided to break things
down into three directories that map to the three monolithic files I had
before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2020-06-07 at 16.36.28.png" src="https://blog.davep.org/attachments/2020/06/07/Screenshot 2020-06-07 at 16.36.28.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'm not totally wedded to this design and I may change this as time
goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I've not spent any time properly testing it out, I've also not really
noticed any obvious impact on startup speed. However, this tends not to be a
real concern for me. I seldom &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; Emacs anyway. I always have it running
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;and use &lt;code&gt;emacsclient&lt;/code&gt; as my editor in most places so files open instantly
in the running version of Emacs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:171-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note from future me: we're now back over on &lt;code&gt;blog.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; of
course.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:171-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>dnote.el - A wrapper for the dnote CLI</title>
    <updated>2020-01-19T16:35:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Late on last year I stumbled on an article about
&lt;a href="https://www.getdnote.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dnote&lt;/a&gt;. Annoyingly, I can't recall now where I
saw it, but I made a reminder to look at it over my Christmas break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dnote looked like a tool that would fill a hole I had in how I work. When it
comes to making notes about things, and keeping things for future reference,
I use a few tools, each one being just right (for me) for the job in
question. I use &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; to track documents and
other household type things. I use &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/keep/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt; to
make notes about stuff I need to remember short-term (say, the size of a
space in my bedroom that I want furniture to go in) and also to record notes
while in meetings at work. I use &lt;a href="https://journey.cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt; to keep a
journal about... anything, really. Finally, &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I use
Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; to keep hold of URLs I might want to
go back to (I also use it to create a to-read list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst all of this, however, I felt I was missing something for keeping
track of things that don't really fall into any of the categories above.
Mostly this would be work-based or hacking-based things that are short and
sweet but I don't always use enough to easily remember. I wanted just the
right tool that would let me ferret away useful one-liners, remind myself of
obscure switches that get used once or twice a year, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading up on dnote it seemed pretty clear that this was just such a
tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting back to the office at the start of this month I decided to
make use of it and see how it went. My idea was simple: I'd record any "TIL"
stuff that I might want to remember in the future, as well as recording
things I need now and again but can't always remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it's working quite well. I like that it has a simple CLI. I like that
it's got a backend that you can use to sync between different machines. I
like that it's got a web interface that's mobile-friendly. I like that &lt;a href="https://github.com/dnote/dnote" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it's
Free Software&lt;/a&gt; and so you can host your own
server if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found I liked it enough that, of course, I felt the need to start &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/dnote.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a
simple Emacs wrapper for the CLI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment dnote.el is designed to be a simple capture system. There are
commands for capturing a one-liner (entered in the Emacs mini-buffer), for
capturing the content of the current buffer, and for capturing
freshly-entered multi-line text, entered in a buffer that uses
&lt;code&gt;markdown-mode&lt;/code&gt;. There's also a command for syncing notes if you have
configured dnote to talk to a backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't have right now is the ability to navigate and view notes. So
far I've not really felt the need for that because the CLI approach works so
well. Longer-term though I can see my tweaking this and adding in commands
for searching, viewing, editing and deleting notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for now, if you've not had a look at dnote, I'd highly recommend having
a play and seeing if it makes sense for you. And, if it does, and you're an
Emacs user, perhaps dnote.el will be useful too?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>nuke-buffers.el -- Tidy up open buffers in Emacs</title>
    <updated>2019-12-14T13:17:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Both at work and at home I use Emacs by &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;keeping a copy running all the
time&lt;/a&gt;, and use &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;emacsclient&lt;/code&gt; to open
files inside
it&lt;/a&gt;
(including on remote machines thanks to a bit of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and heavy use of
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tramp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -- I might write this up at
some point). This works really well, but does mean I tend to build up a lot
of buffers over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lots of buffers open isn't generally an issue, and if I'm working on
lots of different files in a project during the course of a hacking session
it's actually a good thing. But, quite often, I want to tidy up the buffer
list, clearing it back to near-zero buffers open. Many years ago, when I had
a "proper" tower system running 24/7, with Emacs open all the time, I'd use
&lt;a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MidnightMode" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;clean-buffer-list&lt;/code&gt; as part of
&lt;code&gt;midnight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way
that fell out of favour with me, likely because I drifted into using
machines that had Emacs open all the time but where the machine wasn't awake
all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I decided to have some fun rolling my own solution, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nuke-buffers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try and do things in an automated way, this was designed to be
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/ffc863ca0fb669d2f6639bda62e81764c35767ce/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L98-L107" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;bound to a key (or
two)&lt;/a&gt;
and then be run when I wanted, being as harsh as possible about cleaning up
the buffer list. Since first writing it it's worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I tend to let the buffer list build up as I work on a new
feature, or chase down a bug, etc. Then, once I've made the final commit for
that period of focus, I'll hit the &lt;code&gt;nuke-buffer&lt;/code&gt; key combo as the final act
of confirming that I've done the job. So not only does this help tidy my
Emacs session a bit, it also feels like a physical form of punctuation --
back in less sensible days, when I had some terrible habits, it would have
been when I'd reach for the celebratory cigarette; buffer-tidying feels far
more wholesome. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the code works is, of course, mostly directed at how I work -- it's
highly likely it wouldn't make sense for many other people. The main aim is
to kill as many buffers as possible, but without disturbing anything else.
The list of buffers it gathers for nuking avoids buffers that are &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L60-L62" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;visiting
files but have unsaved
content&lt;/a&gt;,
avoids &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L54" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the
minibuffer&lt;/a&gt;
(obviously), avoids &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L56" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;any "special"
buffer&lt;/a&gt;
(one that starts with a space then an asterisk), avoids &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L73" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the current
buffer&lt;/a&gt;
and also avoids &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;any buffer in a list of names to
avoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've being using this on a daily basis for around 2.5 years now and it's
done the job without ever losing me any work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Being phony, and Lispy regular expressions</title>
    <updated>2019-12-01T16:42:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While it does seem that they're a little out of fashion these days, in some
circles anyway, I'm still an avid fan of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; and make files. Even in
environments where I don't need a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; to actually build anything,
I'll use one (or more) to help create handy shortcuts for getting stuff
done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the main &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; for one of my major work projects, there's 45
targets that help fire off various jobs (all of them &lt;a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;self-documenting using
a variation on an approach I read a while
back&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the targets aren't real targets. That's to say, they don't
build the thing they're called. They are &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;phony
targets&lt;/a&gt;.
So, as makes sense, I make a point of marking them all as such. I follow the
convention that has the &lt;code&gt;.PHONY&lt;/code&gt; marker appear on the line before the
target; this feels cleaner to me and easier to follow and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.... I'm lazy. And I use Emacs. Typing out &lt;code&gt;.PHONY foo&lt;/code&gt; all the time
feels like far too much work. So, some time ago, I quickly threw together
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/make-phony.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;make-phony.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this I could be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lazy. I could type out the &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; target
and then, with my cursor on it, press a key combination and have the
&lt;code&gt;.PHONY&lt;/code&gt; marker put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it save much time? Yeah, probably not really. But it was a fun little
exercise and an excuse to write a little bit of Emacs Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one thing I made a point of doing in the heart of this too: using
&lt;code&gt;rx&lt;/code&gt;. For anyone who doesn't know of it, think of it as a very Lispy way of
writing regular expressions. I won't even try and explain it all here
&lt;a href="http://francismurillo.github.io/2017-03-30-Exploring-Emacs-rx-Macro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;because others have done an excellent job
already&lt;/a&gt;.
What I will do is say this: if you're in the habit of writing some Emacs
Lisp, or even tinkering with your configuration, and you find yourself
writing a regular expression, consider looking at &lt;code&gt;rx&lt;/code&gt; -- it's well worth
the time to get to know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, as time goes on, I'm weeding out "vanilla" regular expressions from
my config and code and moving over to using &lt;code&gt;rx&lt;/code&gt;. I feel, quite rightly I
think, that &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b3185a1dbaa0a16f540465844b84c5e1c6a77180/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L117-L126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;something like
this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;rx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Ignore hidden files.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;bol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; I never want to edit the desktop.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Desktop/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;eol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Ignore compiled files.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;pyc&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;elc&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;eol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;.egg-info/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;eol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is much easier to write, read and maintain, than this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;\\(^\\.\\)\\|\\(Desktop/$\\)\\|\\(\\.\\(?:\\(?:\\(?:el\\|py\\)c\\)\\)$\\)\\|\\(\\.egg-info/$\\)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the regular expression above can be written in a more
efficient way (and I imagine it can), as someone working in a Lisp
environment, I'd much sooner write and work with the &lt;code&gt;rx&lt;/code&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the start of this month &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/11/02/emacsconf-2019.html"&gt;I spent a very enjoyable Saturday afternoon
watching EmacsConf 2019&lt;/a&gt;. If you missed it,
or even if you didn't, you might like to know that &lt;a href="https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacsconf-discuss/2019-11/msg00002.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the announcement has
gone out&lt;/a&gt;
that almost all of the videos are &lt;a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/videos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;now available for
watching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I mean nothing negative about any other video, I think the two that
stand out the most for me, in terms of things that grabbed my interest, were
&lt;a href="https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/08.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How a Completely Blind Manager/Dev Uses Emacs Every
Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/15.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emacs as my Go To
Script Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to recall that both those talks were hit with technical issues (many
talks on the day were -- part of the enjoyment for me was how the whole
conference was an experiment in using Free Software to host the whole
thing), but they're well worth a watch despite this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any sort of interest in Emacs I'd highly recommend dipping into
the whole collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope there's going to be a 2020 EmacsConf.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Visual evolution of ~/.emacs.d</title>
    <updated>2019-11-23T14:42:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As detailed in a blog post I wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html"&gt;back in
2016&lt;/a&gt;, I first got into
using Emacs in the mid 1990s, starting with it on OS/2 and then moving over
to GNU/Linux. It's been my often-used and much-loved development environment
for most of those years (I even have a couple of packages that are part of
Emacs itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of that time my configuration was a single &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file, which
was around 1,000 lines in length (including comments and whitespace). It'd
grown over the years, having special configuration sections for versions of
Emacs I didn't use any more, and operating systems I didn't work on any more
(yes, really, there were things in there specific to MS-DOS, for example).
On top of that I always hand-installed packages I used -- Emacs' package
management system having turned up long after I first got into using Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in early 2016, I decided to nuke the whole thing and start from
scratch. As mentioned above, the start of this &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html"&gt;is detailed in an older
post&lt;/a&gt;. Another big round of
changes &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html"&gt;happened round a year
later&lt;/a&gt; -- which included
the birth of &lt;a href="http://blog.davep.org/delpa/"&gt;delpa&lt;/a&gt; to manage my personal
packages. A couple or so months later there was &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html"&gt;one last big round of
changes&lt;/a&gt;, mostly killing
off my enthusiastic embracing of
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;customize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and instead going back to hand-set settings, only this time done via
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full history of this &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;can be found over on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the first "throw
everything away and start again" process and all the steps between then and
where my Emacs configuration is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the fun part of this blog post. Earlier this week I
stumbled on &lt;a href="https://gource.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Gource&lt;/a&gt;. It's a tool that's primarily
designed to visualise changes in repositories, although it can be used to
visualise anything that has a tree structure and changes over time (this
week I produced a video of the growth of my employer's electronic lab
notebook by hooking up the &lt;a href="https://www.benchling.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Benchling&lt;/a&gt; API with
Gource, for example). So I got curious. What did it look like as I reworked
and tweaked and changed and tinkered with my Emacs configuration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For anyone who doesn't know, today is the day for &lt;a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;EmacsConf
2019&lt;/a&gt;. As you might gather from the name, it's
a conference all about Emacs, the joys of Emacs, Emacs Lisp and other
Emacs-related things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better still, it's an online conference (although there do appear to be a
couple of related physical gatherings around the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got snacks and drinks in and no plans for my Saturday, and I hope to
follow the whole thing from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>gitweb.el -- Quickly visit a repo's forge from Emacs</title>
    <updated>2019-10-21T10:41:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gh.fish&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/10/20/fg-fish.html"&gt;I wrote about yesterday&lt;/a&gt;,
actually sprang from something I initially wrote for Emacs. I'm often
spending my time switching between Emacs and the command line (which is fast
and easy -- I normally work on macOS and have Emacs and
&lt;a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; running full screen, and I can switch
between them without ever taking my hands off the keyboard), so it makes
sense to have some handy commands repeated in both places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, originally, I'd written
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/gitweb.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gitweb.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to open the current repo's
"forge" in the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the fish version, how it works is quite simple. I use
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Synchronous-Processes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell-command-to-string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to call git and find the origin URL for the current repo, and then
manipulate it a bit to turn it into a normal browser-friendly URL. Finally,
if I get something workable, I use
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Browse_002dURL.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;browser-url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to have the resulting page open in the browsing environment of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the command &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/8f1be3a03e4be98155571939fe5d6fbb54de487f/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L51-L54" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;bound to a key combination that's similar to the ones I
use with magit and
forge&lt;/a&gt;,
so in terms of muscle-memory it's easy for me to remember what to press when
I quickly want to skip over from a magit view to the repo forge itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to what I wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/10/19/pypath-el.html"&gt;a couple of days back&lt;/a&gt;,
I think this again illustrates how handy Emacs is as a work environment.
While it's absolutely true that there are other development environments out
there that offer similar extensibility, Emacs is the one I'm comfortable
with, and it has a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; history of offering this.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>pypath.el -- A little Emacs hack to help with Django</title>
    <updated>2019-10-19T10:35:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really like about coding with Emacs is how I can easily
identify a repeated task and turn it into a command in my environment,
saving me a load of work down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pypath.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one such example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my day job I write a lot of Django code. As part of that, I write a good
number of unit tests too. Sometimes I'll write the tests as I'm writing the
code they test, other times I'm writing them afterwards; it all really
depends on where my head's at and how the code is flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm writing those tests, I often want to test them as I go. Given that
starting up a test session can take a while, and given that running all the
tests in the system can take a while, it's really handy if I can run that
single test I'm working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easy enough with Django. In my work environment it's normally
something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;run&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;./manage.py&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-v&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;app.test.some.sub.module.TestClass.test_method
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only... typing out the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TestClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;part is a bit of a pain. Sure, once you've typed it the once you can use
your shell of choice (mine being &lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and on
occasion
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;eshell&lt;/a&gt;)
to recall it from history, but typing it out the first time is the annoying
part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this was the point where I took 1/2 hour or so to code up
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pypath.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to solve the problem for
me. It gives me two commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pypath&lt;/code&gt;: which simply places the dotted path of the &lt;a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/python-info-current-defun.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;current
  "defun"&lt;/a&gt;,
  within the context of being part of a Django system, into the clipboard
  buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pypath-django-test&lt;/code&gt;: which works similar to the above but places the
  whole Django testing command into the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above, I can work on a test, hit the latter command above, flip to
my command line, paste and I'm running the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'm sure there's plenty of other handy ways to do this. Doubtless
there's work environments where the test can be run right there, in the edit
buffer, without flipping away, and which takes into account the fact that
there's a pipenv-managed virtual environment involved, etc. If there is,
that's great, but I don't think it'd work with how I work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's one of the things I really love about Emacs, and why it's still
my work environment after almost 25 years of on and off use: with very
little work on my part I can create a couple of commands that work exactly
how I need them to. While it's great to create &lt;a href="https://melpa.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;generally-useful code for
Emacs that lots of people benefit from&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes the
real value is that &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/delpa/"&gt;you can code up your own particular quirk and just get
on with stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude: this post isn't to show off &lt;code&gt;pypath.el&lt;/code&gt;; really this post is to
sing the praises of Emacs and why it still works so well for me after all
these years.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>More revamping of my Emacs config</title>
    <updated>2017-07-13T15:25:29+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty quiet on here since I last wrote about how I'd done a
further revamp of my Emacs config, so I thought that subject would be a good
reason to write another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be a mostly short one, and one to muse over something that's been
bugging me for a while now: my decision to lean heavily on &lt;code&gt;customize&lt;/code&gt; to
set all sorts of settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially,
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html"&gt;when I nuked my original config over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;,
it seemed to make a lot of sense. Let all the tweaks and set values "hide"
in a file of their own and try and keep the hand-edited config files as
small and as clean as possible. Recently though I've got to thinking that
this obscures too much, hides too much detail, and removes the ability to
actually document what I'm doing and why. It also does make it tricky to
adapt some settings to different platforms or even environments on a single
platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem I've run into is
this:
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html"&gt;when I made the second round of changes&lt;/a&gt; and
decided to lean heavily
on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I soon ran into
the minor issue of some packages not making sense, or even being needed, on
some platforms (stuff that's useful on my macOS machines isn't always useful
on my Windows machines, that sort of thing). While &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; can handle
this easily thanks to the &lt;code&gt;:if&lt;/code&gt; keyword, I'm still left with the fact that
&lt;code&gt;package-selected-packages&lt;/code&gt; still gets populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;code&gt;package-selected-packages&lt;/code&gt; contain a list of installed packages
likely makes sense if you're using just the Emacs package system and you're
not doing the installing with &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:ensure&lt;/code&gt;. But with
&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:ensure&lt;/code&gt; I feel like I've got far more control over
things and can adapt what gets installed when depending on which Emacs I'm
running where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, because I'm syncing my &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/.custom.el&lt;/code&gt; to all my machines too, any
&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; that has a &lt;code&gt;:if&lt;/code&gt; to not bother using a package has little
effect because the package still ends up being listed/loaded/seen as part of
the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I think, I'd like to be able to have &lt;code&gt;package-selected-packages&lt;/code&gt;
held in its own file, or I'd only ever use &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/.custom.el&lt;/code&gt; for local
stuff (and so stop syncing it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today I'm going about a process of moving as much as I can out of
&lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/.custom.el&lt;/code&gt; and into hand-edited files. In some respects I guess
I am going back to how I used to manage Emacs configuration, but this time
it's not a massive monolithic file-of-Lisp, it's neatly broken down into
sensible sections and it's also biased towards a "grab and config this
package" approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I've not seen any good discussions online about &lt;code&gt;customize&lt;/code&gt; vs
"hand-edit", which strikes me as a little odd as it feels like the perfect
"religious issue" for people to have endless disagreements over. I guess,
over the next couple or so weeks, I'll find out if switching back was a good
idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Another revamp of my emacs config</title>
    <updated>2017-04-01T10:02:18+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just under a year ago I decided to
&lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html"&gt;totally rewrite my GNU emacs config&lt;/a&gt;.
As I wrote at the time, it'd been following me around all sorts of machines
since the early 1990s, starting life on an OS/2 Warp machine and travelling
via MS-DOS, GNU/Linux, Windows and, these days, macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes I made last year have served me really well, but there were two
related issues with it that bothered me a little: the fact that I was
maintaining a local library of elisp code in the repository and, worse
still, I was storing the packages I'd installed from elpa and melpa in the
repository as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this did mean it was pretty easy for me to start up a new installation
of emacs on a machine -- all I had to do was clone the repo and run up emacs
-- I wasn't happy with the duplication involved. I didn't like holding code
in my &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt; repo that was already held in package archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution I saw was in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get some of my code, that might be useful to others, into melpa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow sort my own package archive for my personal code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week or so I've worked on this approach. It initially started
with me tackling item 1 above: I tidied up and
submitted
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/obfusurl.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;obfusurl.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/protocols.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;protocols.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/services.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;services.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/thinks.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;thinks.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/uptimes.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;uptimes.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This was a really
helpful process in that it allowed me to brush up on my elisp and emacs
knowledge. It's a good 15+ years since I last wrote any significant elisp
code and things have moved on a little in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done that I'd managed to move a handful of my own packages out of my
local library of code, and so out of my &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt; repo, but it left me with
the problem of what to do with the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I discovered &lt;code&gt;package-x&lt;/code&gt; and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;,----[ C-h f package-upload-buffer RET ]
| package-upload-buffer is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
| ‘package-x.el’.
|
| (package-upload-buffer)
|
| Upload the current buffer as a single-file Emacs Lisp package.
| If ‘package-archive-upload-base’ does not specify a valid upload
| destination, prompt for one.
`----
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(plus &lt;code&gt;package-upload-file&lt;/code&gt; too, of course). This meant I could, in effect,
start my own personal package archive and look at tackling issue 2 above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This did give me one small problem though: how and where would I host the
archive? I did consider hosting it on a DigitalOcean droplet, but that felt
a little like overkill for something so simple. And then I
realised: &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;! All I needed to do was
keep the package archive in its own repo (which I would have done anyway)
and then make the whole repo the source for a GitHub Pages site. A quick
test later and... it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by this point, I'd farmed some of my code off to melpa, and now had the
rest of it in "delpa" (which I'd called my personal archive). I could now
use the emacs package management system to install third party packages and
also my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was still left with one issue: I was still holding the installed
packages inside my &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt; repo by way of ensuring that all machines were
in sync in terms of what was installed. Now I needed to work out how to
solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, as luck would have
it, &lt;a href="https://github.com/tarsius" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;@tarsius&lt;/a&gt;
had
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/pull/1#issuecomment-288462491" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;suggested I look at&lt;/a&gt; a
package called &lt;a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jwiegley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;@jwiegley&lt;/a&gt;. This was the bit I was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; I would be able to declare which packages I needed, how
they'd be installed and, most important of all, it could be set to handle
the fact that the package wasn't even installed. If a package is requested
and there is no local install &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; is smart enough to get the emacs
package system to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given that, all I need to do was &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/1fa67c2895f345098057654f6acb3b57a77f1194/startup/davep-packages.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;create a startup file that would
declare the packages I use&lt;/a&gt; and
I'd have a setup that should, once I'd cloned &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt;, self-install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except... yeah, one more issue. &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt; isn't part of GNU emacs yet so
I'd need a method of getting it to auto-install so it could then handle
everything else. As it was that was as easy as adding this to the start of
my &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Make sure the package system is up and running early on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package-archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;melpa&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package-archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;delpa&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;http://blog.davep.org/delpa/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;package-initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Bootstrap `use-package&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;package-installed-p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;use-package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;package-refresh-contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;package-install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;use-package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in place I was able to nuke all my config on a machine, clone a
fresh copy of &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt; (having now ceased tracking and storing the
installed packages in that repo), run up emacs, wait a few moments and then
find that everything was installed and ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now a lot smaller than
it was before and, I think, even easier to maintain. Right now I think I'm
very close to the ideal emacs config that I wanted to create when I did the
complete rewrite a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Starting fresh with GNU emacs</title>
    <updated>2016-05-26T12:28:48+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned elsewhere on this blog, over the past few years, my
use of GNU emacs has lapsed somewhat. There was a time when it was my
only editor (except for the odd dips into vim to do some quick
editing) and, back when I used to use GNU Linux as a desktop machine a
lot, I'd have an emacs session up and running pretty much non-stop (it
was one of the reasons I wrote
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/uptimes.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;uptimes.el&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more recent times I've been working more on Windows and often
inside Visual Studio. Even for my own "for fun" programming, I've
mostly being doing things that didn't involve emacs much. In fact,
most of my recent "for fun" coding has been done using
&lt;a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; because it was powerful,
cross-platform and also had great support for
&lt;a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the language I code in a lot when it comes to personal amusement projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that time I've wanted to get back into emacs. Quite a bit seems
to have changed since I was last a very avid user and this also meant
wanting and needing to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed to do was finally get around to killing off
my old &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file. This has followed me around since I first got
into emacs on OS/2 back in the mid 1990s. The file started out with a
few &lt;code&gt;setq&lt;/code&gt; expressions to tweak some settings and just kept growing
and growing. It'd got to a point where there was old stuff in there
that I had no use for and sometimes even no idea what it was
for. Heck, to give some idea of how old the file was: there were items
in there that handled running emacs on MS-DOS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a couple of weeks back, I dumped it. Dumped the whole lot. The
plan then was to recreate it with as little hands-on coding as
possible. I decided that, as much as I could, I'd tweak using
&lt;code&gt;customize&lt;/code&gt; and only hand-code (in &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/init.el&lt;/code&gt; this time
around) things when there was no obvious other way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this is working out really well. Gone has the ugly and
monolithic &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt;, replaced with something far more modular, much
more tidy and far easier to maintain. Whereas my old config was almost
1,000 lines long, the new &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; is currently just 50 lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Make use of the Common Lisp compatibility module.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;cl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Local config/lib directory support.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:user-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Given &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;`file&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;, return a path for it in the local config.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user-emacs-directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defvar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:user-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;davep/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;My local config and code directory.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defvar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:startup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:user-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;davep/startup&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;My local startup code.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defvar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:user-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;davep/lib&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;My local library code.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defvar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:lib-3rd-party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:user-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;davep/lib-3rd-party&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;My local third party code.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;load-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:startup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;load-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Does a package of my own exist in this environment?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;locate-library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;davep:lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;custom-file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the other stuff, things to tweak language modes so they indent
"just so", my own special keyboard bindings, that sort of thing,
they're all farmed off into their own files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I'm trying to do is dump all the old third party code I
had locally and, instead, use emacs' own package manager
now. Currently this is also working well for me given that I'm using
both &lt;a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ELPA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://melpa.org/#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;MELPA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't managed to dump everything yet, but it's a useful exercise
to slowly work through the various files I was carting around and
deciding if I need them or not (like, I'm fairly sure I won't be
needing a &lt;code&gt;cobol-mode&lt;/code&gt; any time soon -- that can go).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of all of this, on top of starting with a "clean slate" emacs,
I've also started keeping track of what I do on GitHub. I've got a
private repo for my &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/&lt;/code&gt; that I can now easily sync between
my various machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thing that I'm starting to try and do is actually make full
use of emacs again. One example is that I'm writing this blog post in
it. Until now I've been using SublimeText with
&lt;a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a Jekyll package to compose and manage things&lt;/a&gt;
but, this time around I'm giving &lt;a href="https://melpa.org/#/hyde" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;hyde&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://melpa.org/#/markdown-mode" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;markdown-mode&lt;/a&gt; a go. So far
they're working out pretty well too (albeit hyde was a bit odd to set
up and isn't 100% making sense to me yet).&lt;/p&gt;</content>
