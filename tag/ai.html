        <div class="post-content">
            <p>This morning, with <a href="/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html">my experiment with
Copilot</a> having settled down a
little bit, I thought I might try and use the result for another little
experiment. For a long time now I've maintained a (currently lapsed)
photoblog. It was always very much tied to <em>"the site formerly known as
twitter"</em> and, since I fully erased my account after the site turned into a
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nazi bar</a>, I've not done anything
to update how it gets populated.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking: I have a full backup of all the images in a couple of
places; perhaps with a bit of coding (and some help from "the AIs") I can
revive it using <a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>?</p>
<p>I tinkered for a wee bit and mostly got something going (albeit I'm going to
have to do some work to back-port the actual dates and times of some earlier
images, and there's a load of work to do to somehow pull out all the tags).
But then I hit a small hitch.</p>
<p>When building BlogMore I made the decision to let it write both the code
<em>and</em> the documentation. It documented a couple of features I never asked
for, but which seemed sensible so I never questioned. On the other hand
neither did I test them at the time (because they weren't important to what
I needed).</p>
<p>It's the exact reason I added this warning at the start of the
documentation:</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-warning">
<div class="admonition-title">⚠️ Warning</div>
<div class="admonition-content">
<p>BlogMore is an experiment in using GitHub Copilot to develop a whole
project from start to finish. As such, almost every part of this
documentation was generated by Copilot and what it knows about the
project. Please keep this in mind.</p>
<p>From what I can see at the moment the documentation is broadly correct,
and I will update and correct it as I work through it and check it myself.
Of course, I will welcome reports of problems or fixes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With this warning in mind, and with the intention of working through the
documentation and testing its claims, I decided to test out one of the
features when building up the new photoblog.</p>
<p>Whereas with this blog I keep all the posts <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/tree/main/content" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a flat
structure</a>,
this time around I thought I'd try out this (taken from the
Copilot-generated BlogMore documentation):</p>
<hr />
<p>BlogMore is flexible about how you organise your posts. Here are some common patterns:</p>
<p><strong>Flat structure</strong> (all posts in one directory):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>posts/
  ├── hello-world.md
  ├── python-tips.md
  └── web-development.md
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Files can be date-prefixed (e.g., <code>2026-02-18-hello-world.md</code>) and BlogMore will automatically remove the date prefix from the URL slug. The post will still use the <code>date</code> field from frontmatter for chronological ordering.</p>
<p><strong>Organised by date</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>posts/
  ├── 2024/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   │   └── hello-world.md
  │   └── 02/
  │       └── python-tips.md
  └── 2025/
      └── 01/
          └── web-development.md
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Organised by topic</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>posts/
  ├── python/
  │   ├── decorators.md
  │   └── type-hints.md
  └── web/
      ├── css-grid.md
      └── javascript-tips.md
</code></pre></div>

<hr />
<p>Using the hierarchy approach, especially with dates, seemed ideal! I'd drop
the actual images in such a hierarchy, and also drop the Markdown posts in a
parallel hierarchy too. Perfect!</p>
<p>So I set it all up to do that, fired up <code>blogmore serve</code>, visited the URL
and... <code>No posts yet</code>. What the hell?</p>
<p>So I checked the code for BlogMore and, sure enough, despite the fact the
documentation was selling me on this handy way to organise my posts, no such
feature existed!</p>
<p>As an experiment <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/issues/129" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I then asked Copilot what the heck was going
on</a>. Much as I expected,
rather than coming back with an answer to the question, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/130" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it went right ahead
and fixed it instead</a>. Which is
fine, that's where I would have taken this, but I do wish it would answer
the question first.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-note">
<div class="admonition-title">ℹ️ Note</div>
<div class="admonition-content">
<p>I imagine I could get an answer to the question if I took a more
conversational route with Copilot, rather than writing the question in an
issue and then assigning that issue to it. I must remember to try that at
some point.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, yeah, unsurprisingly Copilot flat out lied<sup id="fnref:21-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21-1">1</a></sup> in the documentation. I'm
not in the least bit shocked by this and, as I said, I fully expected this.
But it was amusing to have an example of this turn up so early in the
documentation, in such a glaring way, and in a way that was so easily fixed
(really, it was just a swap of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Path.glob</code></a>
to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Path.rglob</code></a>).</p>
<p>As I play with this more it's going to be fun to see what other bold claims
turn out to not be true; or perhaps even the reverse: what neat features
lurk in the code that haven't been documented.</p>
<div class="footnote">

<p>Yes, as I mentioned yesterday, that's an anthropomorphism. Folk who
take such things as an indication that you don't understand "AI" might

            <h2 id="another-itch-to-scratch">Another itch to scratch</h2>
<p>As <a href="/2026/02/19/a-new-engine.html">I mentioned yesterday</a>, I've been a happy
user of <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a> for a couple or so years now, but
every so often there's a little change or tweak I'd like to make that
requires diving deeper into the templates and the like and... I go <em>"eh,
I'll look at it some time soon"</em>. Another thought that often goes through my
head at those times is <em>"I should build my own static site generator that
works exactly how I want"</em> -- because really any hacker with a blog has to
do that at some point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I've had free access to <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub
Copilot</a> attached to <a href="https://github.com/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my GitHub
account</a> for some time now, and I've hardly used
it. At the same time -- the past few months especially -- I've been watching
the rise of agents as coding tools, as well as the rise of advocates for
them. Worse still, I've seen people I didn't expect to be advocates for
giving up on coding turning to these tools and suddenly writing rationales
in favour of them.</p>
<p>So, suddenly, the idea popped into my head: I should write my own static
site generator that I'll use for my blog, and I should try and use GitHub
Copilot to write 100% of the code, and documentation, and see how far I get.
In doing so I might firm up my opinions about where we're all going with
this.</p>
<p>The requirements were going to be pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a static site generator that turns Markdown files into a
  website.</li>
<li>It should be blog-first in its design.</li>
<li>It should support non-blog-post pages too.</li>
<li>It should be written in Python.</li>
<li>It should use Jinja2 for templates.</li>
<li>It should have a better archive system than I ever got out of my Pelican
  setup.</li>
<li>It should have categories, tags, and all the usual metadata stuff you'd
  expect from a site where you're going to share content from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the requirements would drift and expand as I went along and I had
some new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>To kick things off, I created <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my repo</a>,
and then opened Copilot and typed out a prompt to get things going. Here's
what I typed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a blog-oriented static site generation engine. It should be built in
Python, the structure of the repository should match that of my preferences
for Python projects these days (see https://github.com/davep/oldnews and
take clues from the makefile; I like uv and ruff and Mypy, etc).</p>
<p>Important features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is written in markdown</li>
<li>All metadata for a post should come from frontmatter</li>
<li>It should use Jinja2 for the output templates</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, rather than get very explicit about every single detail, I
wanted to start out with a vague description of what I was aiming for. I did
want to encourage it to try and build a Python repository how I normally
would, so I pointed it at <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OldNews</a> in the
hope that it might go and comprehend how I go about things; I also
doubled-down in the importance of using <code>uv</code> and <code>mypy</code>.</p>
<p>The result of this was... <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actually
impressive</a>. As you'll see in that
PR, to get to a point where it could be merged, there was some
back-and-forth with Copilot to add things I hadn't thought of initially, and
to get it to iron out some problems, but for the most part it delivered what
I was after. Without question it delivered it faster than I would have.</p>
<p>Some early issues where I had to point out problems to Copilot included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of posts on the home page wasn't obvious to me, and absolutely
  wasn't reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Footnotes were showing up kinda odd.</li>
<li>The main index for the blog was showing just posts titles, not the full
  text of the article as you'd normally expect from a blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing terrible, and it did get a lot of the heavy lifting done and done
well, but it was worth noting that a lot of dev-testing/QA needed to be done
to be confident about its work, and doing this picked up on little details
that are important.</p>
<h3 id="an-improvement-to-the-markdown">An improvement to the Markdown</h3>
<p>As an aside: during this first PR, I quickly noticed a problem where <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904192942" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was
getting this error when generating the site from the
Markdown</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Error generating site: mapping values are not allowed in this context
  in &quot;&lt;unicode string&gt;&quot;, line 3, column 15
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just assumed it was some bug in the generated code and left Copilot to
work it out. Instead it came back and educated me on something: <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904197313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I actually
had bad YAML in the frontmatter of some of my
posts</a>!</p>
<p>This, by the way, wouldn't be the last time that Copilot found an issue with
my input Markdown and so, having used it, improved my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-major-feature-from-a-simple-request">A major feature from a simple request</h3>
<p>Another problem I ran into quickly was that previewing the generated site
wasn't working well at all; all I could do was browse the files in the
filesystem. So, almost as an offhand comment, in the initial PR, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904205550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I
asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we get a serve mode please so I can locally test the site?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like that, it went off <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1/changes/3449eec9b4df88e66eec0f6bba4369926ff1389e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and wrote a whole server for the
project</a>.
While the server did need a lot of extra work to really work well<sup id="fnref:127-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-1">1</a></sup>, the
initial version was good enough to get me going and to iterate on the
project as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-workflow">The main workflow</h2>
<p>Having kicked off the project and having had some success with getting
Copilot to deliver what I was asking for, I settled into a new but also
familiar workflow. Whereas normally, when working on a personal project,
I'll write an issue for myself, at some point pick it up and create a PR,
review and test the PR myself then merge, now the workflow turned into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an issue but do so in a way that when I assign it to Copilot it has
  enough information to go off and do the work.</li>
<li>Wait for Copilot to get done.</li>
<li>Review the PR, making change requests etc.</li>
<li>Make any fixes that are easier for me to fix by hand that describe to
  Copilot.</li>
<li>Merge.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the first step had some sub-steps to it too, I was finding. What I
was doing, more than ever, was writing issues like I'd write sticky notes:
with simple descriptions of a bug or a new feature. I'd then come back to
them later and flesh them out into something that would act as a prompt for
Copilot. I found myself doing this so often I ended up adding a "Needs
prompt" label to my <a href="https://github.com/davep/setup-standard-labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usual set of issue
labels</a>.</p>
<p>All of this made for an efficient workflow, and one where I could often get
on with something else as Copilot worked on the latest job (I wasn't just
working on other things on my computer; sometimes I'd be going off and doing
things around the house while this happened), but... it wasn't fun. It was
the opposite of what I've always enjoyed when it comes to building software.
I got to dream up the ideas, I got to do the testing, I got to review the
quality of the work, but I didn't get to actually lose myself in the flow
state of coding.</p>
<p>One thing I've really come to understand during those 5 days of working on
BlogMore was I <em>really</em> missed getting lost in the flow state. Perhaps it's
the issue to PR to review to merge cycle I used that amplified this, perhaps
those who converse with an agent in their IDE or in some client application
keep a sense of that (I might have to try that approach out), but this feels
like a serious loss to me when it comes to writing code for personal
enjoyment.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-problems">The main problems</h2>
<p>I think it's fair to say that I've been surprised at just how well Copilot
understood my (sometimes deliberately vague) requests, at how it generally
managed to take some simple plain English and turn it into actual code that
actually did what I wanted and, mostly, actually worked.</p>
<p>But my experiences over the past few days haven't been without their
problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-confidently-wrong-problem">The confidently wrong problem</h3>
<p>Hopefully we all recognise that, with time and experience, we learn where
the mistakes are likely to turn up. Once you've written enough code you've
also written plenty of bugs and been caught out by plenty of edge-cases that
you get a spidey-sense for trouble as you write code. I feel that this kind
of approach can be called cautiously confident.</p>
<p>Working with Copilot<sup id="fnref:127-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-2">2</a></sup>, however, I often ran into the confidently wrong
issue. On occasion I found it would proudly<sup id="fnref:127-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-3">3</a></sup> request review for some
minor bit of work, proclaiming that it had done the thing or solved the
problem, and I'd test it and nothing had materially changed. On a couple of
occasions, when I pushed back, I found it actually doubting my review before
finally digging in harder and eventually solving the issue.</p>
<p>I found that this took time and was rather tiring.</p>
<p>There were also times where it would do the same but not directly in respect
to code. One example I can think of is when it was confident that Python
3.14 was still a pre-release Python as of February 2026 (<a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it
isn't</a>).</p>
<p>This problem alone concerns me; this is the sort of thing where people
without a good sense for when the agent is probably bullshitting will get
into serious trouble.</p>
<h3 id="the-tries-too-hard-problem">The tries-too-hard problem</h3>
<p>A variation on the above problem works the other way: on at least one
occasion I found that Copilot tried too hard to fix a problem that wasn't
really its to fix.</p>
<p>In this case <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was asking it to tidy up some validation issues in the RSS
feed data</a>. One of the main
problems was root-relative URLs being in the content of the feed; for that
they needed to be made absolute URLs. Copilot did an excellent job of fixing
the problem, but one (and from what I could see only one) relative URL
remained.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110#issuecomment-3928257463" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked it to take a
look</a>
and it took a real age to work over the issue. To its credit, it dug hard
and it dug deep and it got to the bottom of the problem. The issue here
though was it tried too hard because, having found the cause of the problem
(a typo in my original Markdown, which had always existed) it went right
ahead and built a workaround for this one specific broken link.</p>
<p>Now, while I'm a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Postel's
law</a>, this is taking
things a bit too far. If this was a real person I'd tasked with the job I
would have expected and encouraged them to come back to me with their
finding and say <em>"dude, the problem is in your input data"</em> and I'd have
fixed my original Markdown.</p>
<p>Here though it just went right ahead and added this one weird edge case as
something to handle.</p>
<p>I think this is something to be concerned about and to keep an eye on too. I
feel there's a danger in having the agent rabbit-hole a fix for a problem
that it should simply have reported back to me for further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="the-never-pushes-back-problem">The never-pushes-back problem</h3>
<p>Something I did find unsurprising but disconcerting was Copilot's
unwillingness to push back, or at least defend its choices. Sometimes it
would make a decision or a change and I'd simply ask it why it had done it
that way, why it had made that choice. Rather than reply with its reasoning
it would pretty much go <em>"yeah, my bad, let me do it a way you're probably
going to find more pleasing"</em>.</p>
<p>A simple example of this is one time when I saw some code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@property</span>
<span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">some_property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">SomeValue</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">blogmore.utils</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">some_utility_function</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm not a fan of imports in the body of methods <em>unless</em> there's a
demonstrable performance reason. I asked Copilot why it had made this choice
here and its reply was simply to say it had gone ahead and changed the code,
moving the import to the top of the module.</p>
<p>I see plenty of people talk about how working with an agent is like
pair-programming, but I think it misses out on what's got to be the biggest
positive of that approach: the debate and exchange of ideas. This again
feels like a concern to be mindful of, especially if someone less
experienced is bringing code to you where they've used an agent as their
pair buddy.</p>
<h2 id="the-overall-impression">The overall impression</h2>
<p>Now I'm at the end of the process, and using the result of this experiment
to write this post<sup id="fnref:127-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-4">4</a></sup>, I feel better informed about what these tools offer,
and the pitfalls I need to be mindful of. Sometimes it wasn't a terrible way
of working. For example, on the first day I started with this, at one point
on a chilly but sunny Sunday afternoon, I was sat on the sofa, MacBook on
lap, guiding an AI to write code, while petting the cat, watching the birds
in the garden enjoy the content of the feeder, all while chatting with my
partner.</p>
<p>That's not a terrible way to write code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as I said earlier, I missed the flow state. I <em>love</em>
getting lost in code for a few hours and this is not that. I also found the
constant loop of prompt, wait, review, test, repeat, really quite
exhausting.</p>
<p>As best as I can describe it: it feels like the fast food of software
development. It gets the job done, it gets it done fast, but it's really not
fulfilling.</p>
<p>At the end of the process I have a really useful tool, 100% "built with AI",
under my guidance, which lets me <em>actually</em> be creative and build things I
do create by hand. That's not a bad thing, I can see why this is appealing
to people. On the other hand the process of building that tool was pretty
boring and, for want of a better word... soulless.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I write this I have about 24 hours of access to GitHub Copilot Pro left.
It seems this experiment used up my preview time and triggered a <em>"looks
like you're having fun, now you need to decide if you want to buy it"</em>
response. That's fair.</p>
<p>So now I'm left trying to decide if I want to pay to keep it going. At the
level I've been using it at for building BlogMore it looks like it costs
$10/mth. That actually isn't terrible. I spend more than that on other
hobbies and other forms of entertainment. So, if I can work within the
bounds of that tier, it's affordable and probably worth it.</p>
<p>What I'm not sure about yet is if I want to. It's been educational, I can
100% see how and where I'd use this for work (and would of course expect an
employer to foot the bill for it or a similar tool), and I can also see how
and where I might use it to quickly build a personal-use tool to enable
something more human-creative.</p>
<p>Ultimately though I think I'm a little better informed thanks to this
process, and better aware of some of the wins people claim, and also better
informed so that I can be rightly incredulous when faced with some of the
wilder claims.</p>
<p>Also, it'll help put <a href="https://raindrop.io/davep/public-46742255/search/sort=-created&amp;perpage=30&amp;page=0&amp;search=%23AI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of my

            <p>For <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">about 2 and a half years
now</a> this blog has been built
with <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a>. For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).</p>
<p>There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.</p>
<p>Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.</p>
<p>The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.</p>
<p>The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
<a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>; a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.</p>
<p>At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'd
love to hear about
it</a>.</p>
<p>As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... that's a blog post to come.</p>
<p>I took lots of notes.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>After having knocked up <a href="/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html">obs2nlm the other day</a> I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: <a href="/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html">one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection</a>!</p>
<p>And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as <code>obs2nlm</code>, only it
uses <a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ngdb</code></a> to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be working a treat.</p>
<p><img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre" /></p>
<p>Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.</p>
<p>I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a <em>long</em>
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I <em>think</em> this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What are all the numbers in square brackets for?</p>
<p><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source <em>and linking to it</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre" /></p>
<p>so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.</p>
<p>If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:</p>
<p><img alt="No citations in the code" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre" /></p>
<p>So, given this, perhaps I can use the
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>--additional-instructions</code></a>
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak <code>ng2nlm</code> itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> exists.</p>

            <p>I'm sure I've mentioned a couple of times before that I've become quite the
fan of <a href="https://obsidian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. For the past few years, at any given
point, I've had a couple of vaults on the go. Generally I find such vaults a
really useful place to record things I'd otherwise forget, and of course as
a place to go back and look things up.</p>
<p>But... even then, it's easy enough to forget what you might have recorded
and know that you can even go back and look things up. Also I tend to find
that I can't quite figure out a good way of getting a good overview of what
I've recorded, over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: I've been playing around with Google's
<a href="https://notebooklm.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NotebookLM</a> as a tool to help research and
understand various topics. After doing this with my recent winter break
coding project (more on that in the future) I realised I really should get
serious about taking this approach with my Obsidian Vaults.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is far from novel, I'm sure lots of people have done similar
things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/vault2source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few months
ago</a>, had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> was born.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.</p>
<p>So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I <em>know</em> the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.</p>
<p>Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
<a href="/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html">I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things</a> and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in <a href="https://journey.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Journey</a> for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in <a href="https://evernote.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evernote</a>,
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textualize</a>. It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> will be handy for you.</p>
