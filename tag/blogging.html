            <h2 id="another-itch-to-scratch">Another itch to scratch</h2>
<p>As <a href="/2026/02/19/a-new-engine.html">I mentioned yesterday</a>, I've been a happy
user of <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a> for a couple or so years now, but
every so often there's a little change or tweak I'd like to make that
requires diving deeper into the templates and the like and... I go <em>"eh,
I'll look at it some time soon"</em>. Another thought that often goes through my
head at those times is <em>"I should build my own static site generator that
works exactly how I want"</em> -- because really any hacker with a blog has to
do that at some point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I've had free access to <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub
Copilot</a> attached to <a href="https://github.com/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my GitHub
account</a> for some time now, and I've hardly used
it. At the same time -- the past few months especially -- I've been watching
the rise of agents as coding tools, as well as the rise of advocates for
them. Worse still, I've seen people I didn't expect to be advocates for
giving up on coding turning to these tools and suddenly writing rationales
in favour of them.</p>
<p>So, suddenly, the idea popped into my head: I should write my own static
site generator that I'll use for my blog, and I should try and use GitHub
Copilot to write 100% of the code, and documentation, and see how far I get.
In doing so I might firm up my opinions about where we're all going with
this.</p>
<p>The requirements were going to be pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a static site generator that turns Markdown files into a
  website.</li>
<li>It should be blog-first in its design.</li>
<li>It should support non-blog-post pages too.</li>
<li>It should be written in Python.</li>
<li>It should use Jinja2 for templates.</li>
<li>It should have a better archive system than I ever got out of my Pelican
  setup.</li>
<li>It should have categories, tags, and all the usual metadata stuff you'd
  expect from a site where you're going to share content from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the requirements would drift and expand as I went along and I had
some new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>To kick things off, I created <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my repo</a>,
and then opened Copilot and typed out a prompt to get things going. Here's
what I typed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a blog-oriented static site generation engine. It should be built in
Python, the structure of the repository should match that of my preferences
for Python projects these days (see https://github.com/davep/oldnews and
take clues from the makefile; I like uv and ruff and Mypy, etc).</p>
<p>Important features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is written in markdown</li>
<li>All metadata for a post should come from frontmatter</li>
<li>It should use Jinja2 for the output templates</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, rather than get very explicit about every single detail, I
wanted to start out with a vague description of what I was aiming for. I did
want to encourage it to try and build a Python repository how I normally
would, so I pointed it at <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OldNews</a> in the
hope that it might go and comprehend how I go about things; I also
doubled-down in the importance of using <code>uv</code> and <code>mypy</code>.</p>
<p>The result of this was... <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actually
impressive</a>. As you'll see in that
PR, to get to a point where it could be merged, there was some
back-and-forth with Copilot to add things I hadn't thought of initially, and
to get it to iron out some problems, but for the most part it delivered what
I was after. Without question it delivered it faster than I would have.</p>
<p>Some early issues where I had to point out problems to Copilot included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of posts on the home page wasn't obvious to me, and absolutely
  wasn't reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Footnotes were showing up kinda odd.</li>
<li>The main index for the blog was showing just posts titles, not the full
  text of the article as you'd normally expect from a blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing terrible, and it did get a lot of the heavy lifting done and done
well, but it was worth noting that a lot of dev-testing/QA needed to be done
to be confident about its work, and doing this picked up on little details
that are important.</p>
<h3 id="an-improvement-to-the-markdown">An improvement to the Markdown</h3>
<p>As an aside: during this first PR, I quickly noticed a problem where <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904192942" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was
getting this error when generating the site from the
Markdown</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Error generating site: mapping values are not allowed in this context
  in &quot;&lt;unicode string&gt;&quot;, line 3, column 15
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just assumed it was some bug in the generated code and left Copilot to
work it out. Instead it came back and educated me on something: <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904197313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I actually
had bad YAML in the frontmatter of some of my
posts</a>!</p>
<p>This, by the way, wouldn't be the last time that Copilot found an issue with
my input Markdown and so, having used it, improved my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-major-feature-from-a-simple-request">A major feature from a simple request</h3>
<p>Another problem I ran into quickly was that previewing the generated site
wasn't working well at all; all I could do was browse the files in the
filesystem. So, almost as an offhand comment, in the initial PR, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904205550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I
asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we get a serve mode please so I can locally test the site?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like that, it went off <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1/changes/3449eec9b4df88e66eec0f6bba4369926ff1389e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and wrote a whole server for the
project</a>.
While the server did need a lot of extra work to really work well<sup id="fnref:129-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:129-1">1</a></sup>, the
initial version was good enough to get me going and to iterate on the
project as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-workflow">The main workflow</h2>
<p>Having kicked off the project and having had some success with getting
Copilot to deliver what I was asking for, I settled into a new but also
familiar workflow. Whereas normally, when working on a personal project,
I'll write an issue for myself, at some point pick it up and create a PR,
review and test the PR myself then merge, now the workflow turned into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an issue but do so in a way that when I assign it to Copilot it has
  enough information to go off and do the work.</li>
<li>Wait for Copilot to get done.</li>
<li>Review the PR, making change requests etc.</li>
<li>Make any fixes that are easier for me to fix by hand that describe to
  Copilot.</li>
<li>Merge.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the first step had some sub-steps to it too, I was finding. What I
was doing, more than ever, was writing issues like I'd write sticky notes:
with simple descriptions of a bug or a new feature. I'd then come back to
them later and flesh them out into something that would act as a prompt for
Copilot. I found myself doing this so often I ended up adding a "Needs
prompt" label to my <a href="https://github.com/davep/setup-standard-labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usual set of issue
labels</a>.</p>
<p>All of this made for an efficient workflow, and one where I could often get
on with something else as Copilot worked on the latest job (I wasn't just
working on other things on my computer; sometimes I'd be going off and doing
things around the house while this happened), but... it wasn't fun. It was
the opposite of what I've always enjoyed when it comes to building software.
I got to dream up the ideas, I got to do the testing, I got to review the
quality of the work, but I didn't get to actually lose myself in the flow
state of coding.</p>
<p>One thing I've really come to understand during those 5 days of working on
BlogMore was I <em>really</em> missed getting lost in the flow state. Perhaps it's
the issue to PR to review to merge cycle I used that amplified this, perhaps
those who converse with an agent in their IDE or in some client application
keep a sense of that (I might have to try that approach out), but this feels
like a serious loss to me when it comes to writing code for personal
enjoyment.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-problems">The main problems</h2>
<p>I think it's fair to say that I've been surprised at just how well Copilot
understood my (sometimes deliberately vague) requests, at how it generally
managed to take some simple plain English and turn it into actual code that
actually did what I wanted and, mostly, actually worked.</p>
<p>But my experiences over the past few days haven't been without their
problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-confidently-wrong-problem">The confidently wrong problem</h3>
<p>Hopefully we all recognise that, with time and experience, we learn where
the mistakes are likely to turn up. Once you've written enough code you've
also written plenty of bugs and been caught out by plenty of edge-cases that
you get a spidey-sense for trouble as you write code. I feel that this kind
of approach can be called cautiously confident.</p>
<p>Working with Copilot<sup id="fnref:129-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:129-2">2</a></sup>, however, I often ran into the confidently wrong
issue. On occasion I found it would proudly<sup id="fnref:129-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:129-3">3</a></sup> request review for some
minor bit of work, proclaiming that it had done the thing or solved the
problem, and I'd test it and nothing had materially changed. On a couple of
occasions, when I pushed back, I found it actually doubting my review before
finally digging in harder and eventually solving the issue.</p>
<p>I found that this took time and was rather tiring.</p>
<p>There were also times where it would do the same but not directly in respect
to code. One example I can think of is when it was confident that Python
3.14 was still a pre-release Python as of February 2026 (<a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it
isn't</a>).</p>
<p>This problem alone concerns me; this is the sort of thing where people
without a good sense for when the agent is probably bullshitting will get
into serious trouble.</p>
<h3 id="the-tries-too-hard-problem">The tries-too-hard problem</h3>
<p>A variation on the above problem works the other way: on at least one
occasion I found that Copilot tried too hard to fix a problem that wasn't
really its to fix.</p>
<p>In this case <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was asking it to tidy up some validation issues in the RSS
feed data</a>. One of the main
problems was root-relative URLs being in the content of the feed; for that
they needed to be made absolute URLs. Copilot did an excellent job of fixing
the problem, but one (and from what I could see only one) relative URL
remained.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110#issuecomment-3928257463" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked it to take a
look</a>
and it took a real age to work over the issue. To its credit, it dug hard
and it dug deep and it got to the bottom of the problem. The issue here
though was it tried too hard because, having found the cause of the problem
(a typo in my original Markdown, which had always existed) it went right
ahead and built a workaround for this one specific broken link.</p>
<p>Now, while I'm a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Postel's
law</a>, this is taking
things a bit too far. If this was a real person I'd tasked with the job I
would have expected and encouraged them to come back to me with their
finding and say <em>"dude, the problem is in your input data"</em> and I'd have
fixed my original Markdown.</p>
<p>Here though it just went right ahead and added this one weird edge case as
something to handle.</p>
<p>I think this is something to be concerned about and to keep an eye on too. I
feel there's a danger in having the agent rabbit-hole a fix for a problem
that it should simply have reported back to me for further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="the-never-pushes-back-problem">The never-pushes-back problem</h3>
<p>Something I did find unsurprising but disconcerting was Copilot's
unwillingness to push back, or at least defend its choices. Sometimes it
would make a decision or a change and I'd simply ask it why it had done it
that way, why it had made that choice. Rather than reply with its reasoning
it would pretty much go <em>"yeah, my bad, let me do it a way you're probably
going to find more pleasing"</em>.</p>
<p>A simple example of this is one time when I saw some code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@property</span>
<span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">some_property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">SomeValue</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">blogmore.utils</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">some_utility_function</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm not a fan of imports in the body of methods <em>unless</em> there's a
demonstrable performance reason. I asked Copilot why it had made this choice
here and its reply was simply to say it had gone ahead and changed the code,
moving the import to the top of the module.</p>
<p>I see plenty of people talk about how working with an agent is like
pair-programming, but I think it misses out on what's got to be the biggest
positive of that approach: the debate and exchange of ideas. This again
feels like a concern to be mindful of, especially if someone less
experienced is bringing code to you where they've used an agent as their
pair buddy.</p>
<h2 id="the-overall-impression">The overall impression</h2>
<p>Now I'm at the end of the process, and using the result of this experiment
to write this post<sup id="fnref:129-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:129-4">4</a></sup>, I feel better informed about what these tools offer,
and the pitfalls I need to be mindful of. Sometimes it wasn't a terrible way
of working. For example, on the first day I started with this, at one point
on a chilly but sunny Sunday afternoon, I was sat on the sofa, MacBook on
lap, guiding an AI to write code, while petting the cat, watching the birds
in the garden enjoy the content of the feeder, all while chatting with my
partner.</p>
<p>That's not a terrible way to write code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as I said earlier, I missed the flow state. I <em>love</em>
getting lost in code for a few hours and this is not that. I also found the
constant loop of prompt, wait, review, test, repeat, really quite
exhausting.</p>
<p>As best as I can describe it: it feels like the fast food of software
development. It gets the job done, it gets it done fast, but it's really not
fulfilling.</p>
<p>At the end of the process I have a really useful tool, 100% "built with AI",
under my guidance, which lets me <em>actually</em> be creative and build things I
do create by hand. That's not a bad thing, I can see why this is appealing
to people. On the other hand the process of building that tool was pretty
boring and, for want of a better word... soulless.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I write this I have about 24 hours of access to GitHub Copilot Pro left.
It seems this experiment used up my preview time and triggered a <em>"looks
like you're having fun, now you need to decide if you want to buy it"</em>
response. That's fair.</p>
<p>So now I'm left trying to decide if I want to pay to keep it going. At the
level I've been using it at for building BlogMore it looks like it costs
$10/mth. That actually isn't terrible. I spend more than that on other
hobbies and other forms of entertainment. So, if I can work within the
bounds of that tier, it's affordable and probably worth it.</p>
<p>What I'm not sure about yet is if I want to. It's been educational, I can
100% see how and where I'd use this for work (and would of course expect an
employer to foot the bill for it or a similar tool), and I can also see how
and where I might use it to quickly build a personal-use tool to enable
something more human-creative.</p>
<p>Ultimately though I think I'm a little better informed thanks to this
process, and better aware of some of the wins people claim, and also better
informed so that I can be rightly incredulous when faced with some of the
wilder claims.</p>

            <p>For <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">about 2 and a half years
now</a> this blog has been built
with <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a>. For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).</p>
<p>There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.</p>
<p>Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.</p>
<p>The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.</p>
<p>The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
<a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>; a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.</p>
<p>At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'd
love to hear about
it</a>.</p>
<p>As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... <a href="/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html">that's a blog post to
come</a>.</p>
<p>I took lots of notes.</p>

            <p>Almost <a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html">seven years ago</a> I took
up maintaining an ad-hoc photoblog again. I say again because I'd had one
once before. I'd kicked that off back in the late 200xs, with my little HTC
Magic, and hosted it on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Posterous</a>. Eventually Posterous
was shut down, mostly because the company (or at least the team behind it))
had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424063619/http://blog.posterous.com/big-news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bought up by
Twitter</a>.
When kicking off the blog this time I decided on a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd host it on Blogger.com; it had been around for long enough, and of
  course <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google could be trusted to keep something that big up and running
  for good</a>.</li>
<li>I'd keep multiple backup copies of the images and file them in useful ways
  (I keep copies in Google Photos, on Google Drive, on iCloud and locally).</li>
<li>As much as possible I'd automate the process of doing some, if not all of
  this.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, while it was kind of old as an idea, this felt very much like
one of those things that was perfect to do in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Web
2.0</a> way; the good old reliable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mashable
web</a>!</p>
<p>So the plan became this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every post would be a tweet, posted to Twitter with a <code>#photoblog</code> tag.</li>
<li>I'd use <a href="https://ifttt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ifttt</a> to keep an eye on my tweets and when
  it saw one with that tag it would extract the image, make a post to
  Blogger, drop a copy into Google Drive, and do a couple of other things
  too.</li>
<li>Every week or so I'd do some manual checks to make sure everything is
  looking okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>This worked. Mostly. It ran fine for a few years, with very few problems.
I'd take a photo, manipulate the heck out of it for the emotional effect I
was going for (that was the point of the blog; it was all about the messing
with the image), tweet it, and Web 2.0 magic would happen.</p>
<p>Then the odd issue started to crop up. At one point Twitter made changes to
how images were stored, or something, and the ifttt recipe broke for a wee
while; then they changed the way that public posts could be seen (long
before the Musk-era bullshit) and that broke things again, and so on. I
forget the details but at every point I was able to nurse it back to life
and things carried on.</p>
<p>Recently, of course, it all fell apart when Musk took over Twitter and
massively ruined it, turning it into the steaming pile it is now<sup id="fnref:138-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:138-1">1</a></sup>. I've
honestly lost track of which change broke what, and of course I also gave up
even trying to use Twitter (the drip, drip, drip of right-wing hate politics
got to a point where I could not find a way to make it work any more). So
that's when I decided to cut Twitter out altogether.</p>
<p>This had actually started a little earlier than that, when the whole API
fiasco kicked off. When that came in ifttt had to remove Twitter things from
its free tier; I was on the free tier. I was on the free tier only because I
didn't need anything the paid service offered. If Twitter had been "normal"
and this change had been made I'd have happily paid -- I don't mind paying
for things I find useful.</p>
<p>But, nope, given all the context, I bailed.</p>
<p>So by that point I decided the easiest thing to do was to simply hand-add
posts to Blogger, and also along the way post to <a href="https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/496199122963740964" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a pixelfed account
instead</a>,
reposting those posts from <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my Fosstodon
account</a>. Not ideal, needing more manual
input, but also I was thinking that once I find a good flow I could probably
automate the whole thing again.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's the point I'd reached. Twitter was 100% out of the workflow,
there was a bit more manual intervention, but the <a href="https://seenbydavep.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primary location for the
photos</a> was still getting updated.</p>
<p>Then yesterday I noticed this:</p>
<p><img alt="Broken images in my photoblog" src="/attachments/2023/08/20/borked-photos.png" /></p>
<p>I don't actually quite know exactly what's going on here, and at this point
I really don't care. My working hypothesis is this: when ifttt added the
images to the Blogger posts, it was doing so in a way that it was using the
image hosted by Twitter. Because of this, either due to some change in the
Twitter API, or perhaps because I've locked down my Twitter account, the
images can't be served any more. That's my best guess anyway.</p>
<p>I don't really care to dig deeper than that.</p>
<p>But, yeah, this is another example of the long-growing rot of the dream of
Web 2.0. I'm not surprised; I'm not angry; I'm just disappointed.</p>
<p>Thankfully I have all the images saved (see backup options above), so I can
go back and edit the posts and drop fresh copies of the images into them.
There's 100s of posts affected so this is going to take quite a while; I
mean, sure, I could probably do it in a day if I sat and did nothing else,
but I have other things to do.</p>
<p>Another option would of course be to create a fresh blog using my own tools;
that would be simple enough. I have the images, they're all set with the
right date and time, recreating things would be fairly trivial (post titles
a slight problem but I could work around that); a tool like mkdocs or
Pelican plus some Python code to recreate the posts from the images would be
a fun couple of hours mucking about. But... I have a lot of posts on Blogger
and all the URLs are stable and still there many years later.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could automate the "fixing" of the broken posts? I wonder what the
Blogger API is like to work with?</p>
<p><em>PS: If you've read this and feel that what's </em>really<em> needed is a "helpful"
comment that self-hosting is the solution; please sit on that and read the
above again (and, you know, look over the rest of this blog and the entirety

            <p>While I'm still <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">in blog-tinkering
mode</a> (long may it last!), I
thought it might be handy to keep a page kicking around that has links to
the small collection of "dot file" repositories I have.</p>
<p>Like many people, I keep these in a central location (in my case <a href="https://github.com/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up on
GitHub</a>) so that I can very quickly spin up a
familiar work environment on a new machine (new machines are something that
doesn't happen <em>too</em> often, but it's always good to be able to get going
quickly when it does).</p>
<p>So, depending on browser type/size, either above here or off to the side,
there should now be a permanent link to <a href="/pages/dot-files.html">a page of links to those
repositories</a>.</p>
<p>As I look at it now it's actually surprising to me how much of my
"comfortable" environment is encapsulated in so few tools, and configured
with so few collections of files. There are other tools I use a lot too, but
most of them either have their own sync systems, or they have so few
configuration options (and are likely in a format that isn't easy to
grab/store) that it's not worth the bother.</p>
<p>This feels like a good thing, really.</p>
<p>One thing that's not amongst all of this, partly because it's not that
interesting, but also partly because the repository is private, is a single
bash script called <code>myenv</code>. On a new machine, once I've got enough of a
setup that I can clone from GitHub, I drag this down and run the script and
most of the rest of the environment follows.</p>
<p>It's quite satisfying when I need to use it.</p>

            <p>Well, it didn't take as long as I expected it to. Just <a href="/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html#considering-pelican">yesterday
morning</a> I was
giving <a href="https://getpelican.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a> a look over as a possible engine
for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while
now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I
liked it and wondered how long it would take me to make the switch.</p>
<p>By the evening I was making a proper effort to get the switchover started,
and just a wee while earlier, before writing this post, the switch was made!</p>
<p>The process of making the switch was roughly this (and keep in mind I'm
coming from using Jekyll):</p>
<ol>
<li>Made a branch in the repo to work in.</li>
<li>Removed all of the Jekyll-oriented files.</li>
<li>Decided to set up Pelican and related tools in a virtual environment,
   managed using <code>pipenv</code>.</li>
<li>Ran <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick things off and give me a framework to
   start with.</li>
<li>Renamed the old <code>_posts</code> directory to <code>content</code>.</li>
<li>Kept tweaking the hell out of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/blob/main/pelicanconf.py" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican config
   file</a>
   until it started to look "just so" (this is a process that has been
   ongoing, and doubtless will keep happening for some time to come).</li>
<li>Tried out a few themes and settled on
   <a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flex</a>; while not <em>exactly</em>
   what I wanted, it was close enough to help keep me motivated (while
   rolling my own theme from scratch would seem fun, I just know it would
   mean the work would never get done, or at least finished).</li>
<li>Did a mass tidy up of all the tags in all the posts; something I'd never
   really paid too much attention to as the Jekyll-based blog never actually
   allowed for following tags.</li>
<li>Went though all the posts and removed double quotes from a lot of the
   titles in the frontmatter (something Jekyll seems to have stripped, but
   which Pelican doesn't).</li>
<li>Tweaked the <code>FILE_METADATA</code> to ensure that the slugs for the URLs came
    from the filenames -- by default Pelican seems to slugify the title of a
    post and this meant that some of the URLs were changing.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all I probably spent 6 or 7 hours on making the move; a lot of that
involving reading up on how to configure Pelican and researching themes. The
rest of it was a lot of repetitive work to fix or tidy things.</p>
<p><em>The</em> most important aspect of this was keeping the post URLs the same all
the way back to the first post; as best as I can tell I've managed that.</p>
<p>So far I'm pleased with the result. I'm going to live with the look/theme
for a wee while and see how it sits for me. I'm sure I'll tweak it a bit as
time goes on, but at the moment I'm comfortable with how it looks.</p>

            <p>Since getting my blog editing environment set up on the "new" machine <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">a
couple of days back</a> I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog <a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html">back in 2015</a>, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS<sup id="fnref:35-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new</a>, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.</p>
<p>One that looks promising so far is <a href="https://getpelican.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a>. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).</li>
<li>Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).</li>
<li>Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.</li>
<li>Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">using the library when kicking
  off <code>ng2web</code></a>).</li>
<li>RSS feed generation.</li>
<li>Syntax-highlighted code blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.</p>
<p>Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.</p>
<p>Things got off to a good start with an easy install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;pelican[markdown]&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then used the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a <em>very</em> rough
version of my blog up and going.</p>
<p>It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.</p>
<p>I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a base theme that's to my taste.</li>
<li>Get Disqus working with it so that any old comments remain in place.</li>
<li>Get my image/attachment layout back in place.</li>
<li>Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).</li>
<li>Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.</li>
<li>Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!</p>
<p>Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.

            <p>I'm back! Almost. More or less. In more ways than one. First off, as often
happens with blogs (we've all been there right?), I've been away from
blogging for a while. I've still been online, still been waffling away <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on
twitter</a>, and have also stumbled into
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fosstodon as well</a>. Doubtless plenty of other
things.</p>
<p>A big distraction for me, and one that is ongoing, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mucking about on
YouTube</a>. Since the last time I wrote
anything on the blog I got myself a VR setup, and then a PCVR setup, and
then finally fibre came to the village and I could stream, and... well, you
can see how that would go.</p>
<p>So, in short, that's where I've been and that's what's been keeping me busy.
Now that I'm paying some attention to blogging again (hopefully!) I imagine
some of that will end up on here -- I'd quite like to write about VR and
gaming amongst other things.</p>
<p>Now, I said I'd been away in more ways than one. Another way is explained by
<a href="/2019/10/18/time-to-move-on.html">this post from back in 2019</a>, where I
said I was going to head <a href="https://blog.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over to Hashnode</a> and
carry on blogging there, obviously with an emphasis on development and just
development.</p>
<p>That kept me busy for a while and worked out well, mostly. But... well, see
above in part; I sort of ran out of steam when it came to purely-development
topics. But I still wanted to write, a bit, and wanted to write about more
than just development.</p>
<p>Also, something else was bothering me about being over on Hashnode. In the
past year, in terms of what they promote themselves, especially blogs and
posts they promote on their Twitter feed, they seem to have started to lean
really hard into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto and web3 and
NFTs</a> and all that stuff. This
left me feeling like that was all a bit icky and it was time to put some
distance between that platform and myself.</p>
<p>So over the past couple of weeks, low-level and as a background task, I've
been back-porting posts from over there back into this blog. Starting with
this post all new blog content, be it about software development or anything
else, will be on here. If I'm really sensible and don't get distracted by
new shiny... this should be how it remains now.</p>
<p>Expect some changes over the next few weeks. While I'm aiming to stick with
the core tech (Github pages, Markdown and Jekyll, Emacs to edit, etc), I'd
like to tinker with the look and layout of the blog. The content will remain
the same though.</p>
<p>So, yeah, anyway, if you're reading this... hey, it's good to be back. :-)</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>It's well over a year since I last wrote something on this blog. As
mentioned in the last post (and the one before), it's not for bad reasons or
anything like that. Being in a new job, which actually isn't all that new
now, has kept me busy in all the best ways possible.</p>
<p>There's been other stuff going on too which has drawn on my attention and
the time and motivation to blog, either random stuff, or more
development-related stuff, just hasn't been there.</p>
<p>Also... blogging via GitHub, using Jekyll, has lost a lot of its shine. It
sort of makes sense, well, sort of <em>made</em> sense, but in the end it felt like
more work than it should. Whereas most blogging systems tend to encourage
just diving in and banging on the keyboard, there's just a bit more faff
with the GitHub pages approach.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, and with no desire right now to roll my own (which
would be fun, it has to be said), I'm going to <a href="https://blog.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">skip off over to Hashnode's
blogging system</a>. It seems to have everything I'd
want and I can slap it on a domain of mine.</p>
<p>Most of my random musings about random things really happen on Twitter, so I
can't imagine I'll be wanting to blog about normal/mundane things. What I
would like to do is write about development-related things from time to
time. So that would seem to fit even better.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of all this waffle. If you land here and it looks kind of
quiet, that's because it has been quiet for a while and I'm now going to try
and concentrate elsewhere, with a wish to do some coding-related writing now
and again.</p>

            <p>A few years back, not long after I got my first smartphone (a HTC Magic), I
started maintaining a photoblog that was based around photos I took on that
phone. The blog itself was very important to me as it covered a pretty
difficult time in my life -- many of the images on it contained and conveyed
feelings and emotions that seem a world away now, but which I never want to
totally forget.</p>
<p>It served as a visual diary, a note to future me.</p>
<p>And, hopefully, it provided some entertainment for those who viewed it.</p>
<p>Sadly the company who hosted
it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous#Shutting_down_Posterous_and_building_PostHaven" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed down</a> and
the whole thing was lost, except for a hasty (and only partially successful)
backup to <a href="https://seenbydavep.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Wordpress blog</a>.</p>
<p>After the blog died I sort of lost interest in trying to maintain one and,
to some degree, lost interest in active photography in general. Between the
blog disappearing and another disappointing event relating to photography I
sort of lost confidence in myself and my ability to dare to publish photos
online.</p>
<p>This year, despite how shitty it's been for the world in general, has been a
really good one for me. Lots of positive changes have happened and continue
to happen and I noticed that I was starting to do the phone-based photoblog
thing
again, <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/media" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">albeit only via twitter</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="From up the hill" src="/attachments/2016/11/15/FromUpTheHill.jpg#centre" /></p>
<p>Finally, this week, I've cracked and decided to make it "official". My old
"Seen by davep" blog is reborn, with new content and the same old purpose.
You can find it here: <a href="http://seenbydavep.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>seenbydavep.blogspot.com</strong></a></p>
<p>The blog itself is still driven by twitter and the posts will still appear
on twitter. In the background I have an <a href="https://ifttt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> process
running, watching for any tweet of mine with the #photoblog tag and creating
a post on the blog from it.</p>
<p>As for how often and what the content will be... simple: it'll be when I see
something that I need to capture.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Hello, world.</p>
<p>So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set
of posts on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google+</a> or a torrent
of 140-character thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twitter</a> but
an actual blog.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects
I want to have a go at over the next few months and writing about them as I
work on them might be fun. Another reason is that I've being wanting to explore
the business of hosting a blog on GitHub pages for quite some time and now's
the perfect time to do it.</p>
<p>So how am I doing this? Well, for starters, I recently acquired an iMac. The
reasons for how and why I chose to do this are varied and mostly uninteresting
but what it does mean is that, for the first time in quite a long time, I
have a Unix desktop machine again. This fact alone means it's nice and easy
for me to play with the likes of Git (or, at the moment more
<a href="https://mac.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub for Mac</a> than the command line git), ruby,
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SublimeText</a> (along with
<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a rather nifty package for quickly kicking off a blog post</a>).
So that's how I'm doing it. Writing it all locally and pushing it up to
GitHub and hosting it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>As this goes on I imagine much will change. I've started out with a basic
setup, created by simply using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>davep@Ariel:~/blogging$<span class="w"> </span>jekyll<span class="w"> </span>new<span class="w"> </span>davep.github.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>From now on I'll be playing with styles and my own layouts to see what I can
come up with and what I like (although, I most say, for the most part I'm
actually liking the clean look it delivers out of the box).</p>
<p>One thing that's obviously missing right now is a facility for commenting.
That's something I'll look into should I feel it's necessary -- from what I've
seen elsewhere it's easy enough to make use of something like
<a href="https://disqus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disqus</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>One other thing I might look at doing is putting this behind my own domain.
For the moment it's only available via github.io and I guess it might look
nicer if it was actually available via a URL that looks like the name I've
attached to the blog. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's it for now. Time to push this up and think some more about
where it'll go from here.</p>
