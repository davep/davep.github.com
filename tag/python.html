            <p>For <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">about 2 and a half years
now</a> this blog has been built
with <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a>. For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).</p>
<p>There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.</p>
<p>Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.</p>
<p>The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.</p>
<p>The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
<a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>; a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.</p>
<p>At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'd
love to hear about
it</a>.</p>
<p>As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... that's a blog post to come.</p>
<p>I took lots of notes.</p>

<p>I honestly can't remember when I was first introduced to the idea of
RSS/Atom feeds, and the idea of having an aggregator or reader of some
description to keep up with updates on your favourite sites. It's got to be
over 25 years ago now. I can't remember what I used either, but I remember
using one or two readers that ran locally, right up until I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google
Reader</a>. Once I discovered that
I was settled.</p>
<p>As time moved on and I moved from platform to platform, and wandered into
the smartphone era, I stuck with Google Reader (and the odd client for it
here and there). It was a natural and sensible approach to consuming news
and updates. It also mostly felt like a solved problem and so felt nice and
stable.</p>
<p>So, of course, I was annoyed when Google killed it off, <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like so many useful
things</a>.</p>
<p>When this happened I dabbled with a couple of alternatives and, at some
point, finally settled on <a href="https://theoldreader.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TheOldReader</a>. Since
then it's been my "server" for feed subscriptions with me using desktop and
mobile clients to work against it.</p>
<p>But... I never found anything that worked for me that ran in the terminal.
Given <a href="/tag/terminal.html">I've got a thing for writing terminal-based
tools</a> it made sense I should have a go, and so
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OldNews</a> became my winter break project.</p>
<p><img alt="Reading an article in OldNews" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/reading.png" /></p>
<p>I've written it as a client application for <a href="https://github.com/theoldreader/api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the API of
TheOldReader</a>, and only for that, and
have developed it in a way that works well for me. All the functionality I
want and need is in there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add subscriptions</li>
<li>Rename subscriptions</li>
<li>Remove subscriptions</li>
<li>Add folders</li>
<li>Rename folders</li>
<li>Remove folders</li>
<li>Move subscriptions between folders</li>
<li>Mark read/unread</li>
<li>Read articles (that provide actual content in their feeds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently there's no support for starring feeds or interacting with the
whole "friend" system (honestly: while I see mention of it in the API, I
know nothing of that side of things and really don't care about it). As time
goes on I might work on that.</p>
<p>As with all of my other terminal-based applications, there's a rich command
palette that shows you what you can do, and also what keyboard shortcuts
will run those commands. While I do still need to work on some documentation
for the application (although you'd hope that anyone looking for an RSS
reader at this point would mostly be able to find their way around) the
palette is a good place to go looking for things you can do.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/command-palette.png" /></p>
<p>Plus there's a help screen too.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/help.png" /></p>
<p>If themes are your thing, there's themes:</p>
<p><img alt="Available themes" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/themes.png" />
<img alt="Gruvbox" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/gruvbox.png" />
<img alt="Textual Light" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/textual-light.png" />
<img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/nord.png" /></p>
<p>That's a small selection, and there's more to explore.</p>
<p>Also on the cosmetic front there's a simple compact mode, which toggles
between two ways of showing the navigation menu, the article lists and the
panel headers.</p>
<p><img alt="Not compact" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/not-compact.png" />
<img alt="Compact" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/compact.png" /></p>
<p>OldNews has been a daily-driver for a wee while now, while also under active
development. I think I've covered all the main functions I want and have
also shaken out plenty of bugs, so today's the day to call it v1.0.0 and go
from there.</p>
<p>If you're a user of TheOldReader and fancy interacting with it from the
terminal too then it's out there to try out. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oldnews/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
PyPI</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and running with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oldnews
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed using
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>uv<span class="w"> </span>tool<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oldnews
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you don't have <code>uv</code> installed you can use <a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uvx.sh</a> to
perform the installation. For GNU/Linux or macOS or similar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>-LsSf<span class="w"> </span>uvx.sh/oldnews/install.sh<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>or on Windows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>powershell<span class="w"> </span>-ExecutionPolicy<span class="w"> </span>ByPass<span class="w"> </span>-c<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;irm https://uvx.sh/oldnews/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once installed, run the <code>oldnews</code> command.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is useful to someone else; meanwhile I'll be using it more
and more. If you need help, or have any ideas, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise an
issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/discussions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">start a

            <p>In the past few months, like a lot of folk in the Python world, I've been
won over by <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a>. When it comes to managing my
own projects my journey over the past few years as been
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>pipenv</code></a>, then
<a href="https://rye.astral.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>rye</code></a>, and then when rye was killed off I finally
swapped to <code>uv</code> (later than I should have, I realised in hindsight). At each
step I've found each tool cleaner, easier to work with and more
feature-rich.</p>
<p>There's no doubt in my mind that <code>uv</code> has done the most work to make
installing Python-based tools (or at least PyPI-based tools) <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as
friction-free an experience as
possible</a>.</p>
<p>Now I've discovered <a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uvx.sh</a>. The thing with <code>uv</code> is the
person installing your application first needs to get and install <code>uv</code>; this
site removes that friction. Now if someone wants to install
<a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> (for example) they should be able to
just do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>-LsSf<span class="w"> </span>uvx.sh/obs2nlm/install.sh<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>and away they go (assuming they have <a href="https://curl.se" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">curl</a> installed,
which is generally going to be far more likely than having <code>uv</code> installed).</p>
<p>Of course, there are <a href="https://www.djm.org.uk/posts/protect-yourself-from-non-obvious-dangers-curl-url-pipe-sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the usual caveats and
concerns</a>
about the <em>"just pipe this stuff via <code>sh</code> trust me bro"</em> approach, but if
you are comfortable with suggesting this kind of install method it looks
worth adding this to an application's installation documentation.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to start mentioning it as an option.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>After having knocked up <a href="/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html">obs2nlm the other day</a> I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: <a href="/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html">one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection</a>!</p>
<p>And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as <code>obs2nlm</code>, only it
uses <a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ngdb</code></a> to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be working a treat.</p>
<p><img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre" /></p>
<p>Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.</p>
<p>I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a <em>long</em>
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I <em>think</em> this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What are all the numbers in square brackets for?</p>
<p><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source <em>and linking to it</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre" /></p>
<p>so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.</p>
<p>If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:</p>
<p><img alt="No citations in the code" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre" /></p>
<p>So, given this, perhaps I can use the
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>--additional-instructions</code></a>
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak <code>ng2nlm</code> itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> exists.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>I'm sure I've mentioned a couple of times before that I've become quite the
fan of <a href="https://obsidian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. For the past few years, at any given
point, I've had a couple of vaults on the go. Generally I find such vaults a
really useful place to record things I'd otherwise forget, and of course as
a place to go back and look things up.</p>
<p>But... even then, it's easy enough to forget what you might have recorded
and know that you can even go back and look things up. Also I tend to find
that I can't quite figure out a good way of getting a good overview of what
I've recorded, over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: I've been playing around with Google's
<a href="https://notebooklm.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NotebookLM</a> as a tool to help research and
understand various topics. After doing this with my recent winter break
coding project (more on that in the future) I realised I really should get
serious about taking this approach with my Obsidian Vaults.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is far from novel, I'm sure lots of people have done similar
things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/vault2source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few months
ago</a>, had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> was born.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.</p>
<p>So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I <em>know</em> the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.</p>
<p>Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
<a href="/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html">I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things</a> and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in <a href="https://journey.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Journey</a> for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in <a href="https://evernote.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evernote</a>,
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textualize</a>. It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> will be handy for you.</p>

<p>Back in the very early days of my involvement with
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textualize</a>, while looking for fun things to
build to test out the framework and find problems with it, I created
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>textual-astview</code></a>. The idea was
pretty simple: exercise Textual's
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Tree</code></a> widget by using it to
display the output of Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abstract syntax tree
module</a>.</p>
<p>While the code still works, Textual has moved on a lot, as has my approach
to building applications with Textual, and so I've been wanting to do a
ground-up rewrite of it. At the same time I was also thinking that it might
be interesting to build a tool that provides other ways of understanding how
your Python source gets turned into runnable code; with this in mind I've
ended up building a terminal-based application called DHV.</p>
<p><a href="https://dhv.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="DHV in action" src="/attachments/2025/07/19/dhv.gif" /></a></p>
<p>The idea is pretty straightforward: you type in, paste in, or load up,
Python code, and you get a real-time display of what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resulting
bytecode</a> and abstract syntax
tree would be.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a particular bit of code looks like under the
hood, or wondered if one particular approach to a problem is "more
efficient"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> than another, or just wondered to yourself if <code>1+1</code> ends up
being a complex operation or simply gets turned into <code>2</code>, this tool might be
useful to experiment and see.</p>
<p>As of now DHV only works with Python 3.13. The main reason for this is that
the Python <code>dis</code> module is a bit of a moving target and has had some
noticeable interface changes over the past few versions. When I find some
time I might work on making DHV a little more backward-compatible. But for
now keep this in mind: when you're looking at the results for some code
you're looking at what Python 3.13 (or later) would do, earlier Pythons may
differ.</p>
<p>DHV is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/dhv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dhv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
PyPI</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>dhv
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you're a fan of
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a> and friends
you can install it like this:</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Norton Guide readers</a> or
the <a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories&amp;q=5x5&amp;type=&amp;language=&amp;sort=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5x5
puzzle</a>,
code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto
exercises. I've written versions in many languages, and messed with plots in
some different environments, as varied as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ytRZrHL34" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in VR on the
web</a> to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Self-Documenting-Mandelbrot-by-davepearson/1341910.0S66D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wearable
items</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">my involvement with
Textualize</a> I
<a href="https://github.com/davep/trMandelbrot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a deliberately worst-approach
version</a> using that framework. The
whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also
stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job.</p>
<p>Later on I did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second version that targets
Textual</a>. This time it did a
better job and was the catalyst for building
<a href="https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>. This version was
intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example
application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible
version mentioned above, I still wasn't 100% happy with the way it worked.</p>
<p>Recently I did some maintenance work on <code>textual-canvas</code>, cleaning up the
repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python
projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at
<code>textual-mandelbrot</code> and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn't really
sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not
that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick
off a fresh stand-alone application.</p>
<p><a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Complexitty</a> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Complexitty on startup" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty.png" /></p>
<p>Right now the application has all the same features as the <code>mandelexp</code>
application that came with <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>, plus a couple more. Also
it's built on top of <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the common core
library</a> I've been putting
together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on
<a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ATODO%20label%3AEnhancement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'll add more
features</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed in with Complexitty" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-red.png" /></p>
<p>As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with
comprehensive help for commands and key bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-help.png" /></p>
<p>and there's also a command palette that helps you discover (and run)
commands and their keyboard bindings.</p>

            <p>It pretty much all started with this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> * Revision 1.1  1996/02/15 18:57:13  davep

</code></pre></div>

<p>That's from the rcs log <a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng/blob/master/w3ng.c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for the source for
<code>w3ng</code></a>, a tool I wrote so
I could read Norton Guide files in my web browser, served by Apache, running
on my GNU/Linux server in my office. The tool itself was written as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CGI</a> tool (remember
them?).</p>
<p>I believe I posted about this to <code>comp.lang.clipper</code> and pretty quickly some
folk asked if it might be possible to do a version that would write the
whole guide as a collection of HTML files for static hosting, rather than
serving them from a cgi-bin utility. That seemed like a sensible idea and
so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> * Revision 1.1  1996/03/16 09:49:00  davep
 * Initial revision
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html/blob/master/ng2html.c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2html</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>Fast forward around a quarter of a century and I decided it would be fun to
write <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/">a library for Python that reads Norton Guide
files</a>, and a tool called <code>ng2web</code> was the
first test I wrote of it, designed as a more flexible replacement for
<code>ng2html</code>. I've tweaked and tinkered with the tool since I first created it,
but never actually "finished" it.</p>
<p>That's changed today. I've just released v1.0.0 of <code>ng2web</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="A page generated with ng2web" src="/attachments/2025/03/24/ng2web.png" /></p>
<p>If turning one or more Norton Guide files into static websites seems like
the sort of thing you want to be doing, <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ng2web/">take a look at the
documentation</a>.</p>
<p><code>ng2web</code> is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ng2web/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>ng2web

<p>It can also be installed with

            <p>I've <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/releases/tag/v0.3.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just released AgiNG
v0.3.0</a>. The main focus
of this release was to get some searching added to the application. Similar
to what I added to <a href="https://github.com/davep/weg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WEG</a> back in the day, I
wanted three types of searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current entry search.</li>
<li>Current guide-wide search.</li>
<li>All registered guides-wide search.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current entry search is done with a simple modal input, and for now the
searching is always case-insensitive (I was going to add a switch for this
but it sort of felt unnecessary and I liked how clean the input is).</p>
<p><img alt="Entry search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search.png" /></p>
<p>The search is started by pressing <kbd>/</kbd>, and if a hit is found
<kbd>n</kbd> will take you through all subsequent matches.</p>
<p>As always, if you're not sure of the keys, you'll find them in the help
screen or via the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="Looking up search in the command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search-palette.png" /></p>
<p>Guide-wide and all-guide searching is done in the same dialog. To search
guide-wide you enter what you want to find and untick <em>"All Guides"</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Setting up a guide search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-setup.png" /></p>
<p>With that, the search will stick to the current guide.</p>
<p><img alt="Guide-wide search running" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-running.png" /></p>
<p>As will be obvious, searching all guides that have been registered with
AgiNG is as simple as ticking <em>"All Guides"</em>. Then when you search it'll
take a walk through every entry of every guide you've added to the guide
directory in the application.</p>
<p><img alt="Gide-wide searching" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-search.gif#centre" /></p>
<p>Global searching is accessed with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> or via the
command palette.</p>
<p><img alt="Finding global search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/global-palette.png" /></p>
<p>With this added, I think that's most of the major functionality I wanted for
AgiNG. I imagine there's a few more tweaks I'll think of (for example: I
think adding regex search to the global search screen could be handy), but I
don't think there's any more big features it needs.</p>
<p>AgiNG can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>aging</code>:</p>

<p>It seems I really do still have this need to create new terminal-based
projects at the moment. There's been
<a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">Braindrop</a>, then
<a href="/2025/01/25/peplum.html">Peplum</a>, then after that came
<a href="/2025/02/14/hike.html">Hike</a>. While I'm still tweaking and adding to them,
and also using them to refine <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a wee library I'm building up that forms the
core of my latest apps</a>, I felt I
still had this one app that I <em>needed</em> to finally build.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s I've had this mild obsession with <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">building tools for
maintaining access to Norton Guide
files</a>. I've written readers for
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GNU/Linux (which also works on macOS too)</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OS/2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GNU
Emacs</a>, and also or the web (in multiple
incarnations). Those builds have covered a few languages, including C, C++,
Pascal, JavaScript and Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>I'd never written a Python library or application for it though.</p>
<p>So when I first saw Textual mentioned in passing on Twitter a few years
back, way back in the 0.1 days, I thought that could be the thing that would
push me over the edge. In anticipation of that, back in 2021, I initially
developed <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/"><code>ngdb.py</code></a>. This is a library
that provides the core Norton Guide reading code for Python applications and
could form the basis for other tools.</p>
<p>As a test for this I then wrote <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2web</code></a>
(which works, but I think still needs a bit of tidying up -- something I'm
aiming to do in the next few weeks).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the journey with Textual itself <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">kicked
off</a>, happened, and <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">came to an
end</a>; and yet somehow I'd never got
round to building the thing I'd initially looked at Textual for: a
terminal-based Norton Guide reader that looked nice and modern (by terminal
standards). When I initially joined Textualize the owner had actually said
they wanted me to build this as test of the framework, to essentially start
out by employing me to create some Free Software that would help dogfood the
library, but that seemed to get forgotten.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of this month and I finally felt it was time to
tackle this. The result is <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AgiNG</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-dark.png" /></p>
<p>As of v0.1.0 it has most of the features you'd expect from a usable Norton
Guide reader, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ability to add guide files to an in-application directory.</li>
<li>The ability open and navigate a guide.</li>
<li>Full see-also support, etc.</li>
<li>Full translation of characters as were under MS-DOS into the terminal.</li>
<li>The ability to copy entry text or source to the clipboard.</li>
<li>The ability to copy save entry text or source to a file.</li>
<li>Access to a guide's credits.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AgiNG showing a long entry" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-long-entry.png" /></p>
<p>I still need to write some proper documentation for the application, but
meanwhile all commands and key shortcuts can be discovered either via the
help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG help" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-help-screen.png" /></p>
<p>or by pulling up the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-command-palette.png" /></p>
<p>Hopefully the workings of the application will be fairly obvious to anyone
who is familiar with Norton Guide files; if anything isn't making sense <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'm
more than happy to answer
questions</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/ideas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">take suggestions for
improvements</a>.</p>
<p>One wee feature I want to call out, that I felt was important to add, was a
"classic view" facility. The thing with Norton Guide files is they were
mostly created in the very late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s. People would
often get creative with the colouring within them, but in many cases the
colouring assumed the default Norton Guide application. Its colours were
white text on a blue background. So sometimes other colouring was done
assuming that background.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this here, with an entry in a guide being viewed
using the default <code>textual-dark</code> theme:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in textual-dark" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/textual-dark.png" /></p>
<p>Notice the colouring in the syntax section. This is more obvious if the
application is switched to one of the light themes:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in solarized-light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/solarized-light.png" /></p>
<p>With a nod to this issue in mind, I added the "classic view" for entries
(which is a sticky setting -- turn it on and it stays on until you turn it
off):</p>
<p><img alt="Classic view in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/classic-view.png" /></p>
<p>A little hard on the eyes, I think, but also filled with nostalgia!</p>
<p>Talking of themes, all the usual application themes are available, here's a
wee selection:</p>
<p><img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-nord.png" />
<img alt="Textual Light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-light.png" />

<img alt="Monokai" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-monokai.png" /></p>
<p>AgiNG is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via

<p>Expect to see more updates in the near future; as with other recent projects
this is very much something I'm going to be dabbling with and improving as
time goes on.</p>
