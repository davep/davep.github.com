        <div class="post-content">
            <p>I just realised that it's been a while since I <a href="/2023/12/25/tinboard-0-4-0.html">last posted an
update</a> about <code>tinboard</code>. This is probably
my most-used Textual-based application, and one I'm constantly tinkering
with, and just this morning I published v0.10.0.</p>
<p>Often the changes are small tweaks or fixes to how it works, sometimes
they're simply updates to the version of Textual used, making use of some
new feature or other; I've yet to add another "major" feature so far. They
will come, but so far the ideas I have for the application haven't actually
felt that necessary. Although I say so myself it does what I need it to do
and it does it really well.</p>
<p>So, as a quick catch-up of what's changed since v0.4.0 (which was the last
version I posted about):</p>
<ul>
<li>v0.5.0 was released 2024-01-04; this included all the tags of a bookmark
when doing full-text searching.</li>
<li>v0.6.0 was released 2024-01-10; it fixed a small bug where the tag
suggestion facility got confused by trailing spaces in the input field.</li>
<li>v0.7.0 was released 2024-02-02; this updated the minimum Textual version to
v0.48.2 and removed all the custom changes to the Textual <code>TextArea</code> widget,
making use of the updates to <code>TextArea</code> that version of Textual made
available.</li>
<li>v0.8.0 was released 2024-02-18; this fixed a crash on startup caused by a
newer release of Textual (the fault was in <code>tinboard</code>; the update to Textual
helped reveal the problem).</li>
<li>v0.9.0 was released 2024-02-29; it simply added support for using
<kbd>Esc</kbd> at the top level of the application to quit (I like to camp
on <kbd>Esc</kbd> to GTFO).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just now, I released v0.10.0. This release makes full use of <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/4154" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some
work I recently did to enhance Textual's <code>CommandPalette</code>
widget</a>, which added a
"discover" system. The change in <code>tinboard</code> is that all of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/tree/main/tinboard/commands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">command
palette
providers</a>
now have <code>discover</code> methods too. The result of this change is that when you
open the command palette in <code>tinboard</code> (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) you
can see <em>every</em> possible command right away.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in discovery mode" src="/attachments/2024/03/07/command-palette.png#centre" /></p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source is available on
GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p><img alt="Death Stranding" src="/attachments/2024/02/05/IMG_4223.JPG#centre" /></p>
<p>Death Stranding is easily one of my top 5 games ever. I bought the PS4
version, on a whim, back in early 2020, to see what all the fuss was about.
I didn't know much about it other than the love/hate it seemed to be
getting. I can still remember the first session, being a bit confused about
what was going on, and then suddenly hitting a perfect moment in the game
where I knew it was for me, and that I was going to love it.</p>
<p>That moment? It's when you're setting out for the incinerator, the camera
pulls back, the landscape opens up before you, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwoMJNxiFo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bones</em> by Low Roar
kicks in</a>. Perfection!</p>
<p>I went on to finish the story in around 45 to 50 hours (much of that
overlapping with the first week or so of lockdown during the pandemic); and
then played at least as much again just exploring, building zip lines,
roads, etc.</p>
<p>I even <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kept a photoblog of my time in the
game</a>.</p>
<p>About a year back I bought the Director's Cut of the game, this time for PC.
I'd decided that I had to play it through again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb7390_rldQ&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORDJd_VYhF74e6Mapf8oHp8i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and did start streaming
it</a>.
Annoyingly though the PC setup wasn't great. The game itself ran just fine
on my PC, but the controller setup meant that, as I sat on the sofa, it
would drop connection from time to time. The only workaround for this was to
sit on my office chair closer to the TV and, really, this wasn't
comfortable.</p>
<p>Eventually that play-through fell away.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLstJHlC4U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and the release of the 10 minute Death Stranding
2 trailer</a> and I was hooked all
over again! While it never totally went away, my obsession with this game
was back full force.</p>
<p>I had to play again!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, between the attempt to play through on the PC and now, I'd
acquired a PS5 <em>and</em> at some point I'd upgraded my PS4 version of Death
Stranding to the PS5 Director's Cut.</p>
<p>So I had to. I just had to. I'd had a great time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">streaming my play through
the story of Cyberpunk
2077</a>
so it made sense to do the same with Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Last night I hit <em>New game</em> on my PS5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-irn7AcJ7g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and played for just over 2
hours</a>. This play through is
likely going to take a long time -- my work situation means I have a longer
and more tiring commute -- but I'm determined to do it. I want to experience
all of the extra things in the Director's Cut, including the extra story
(which I've read there is, but haven't seen or read about).</p>
<p>I hope, eventually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-irn7AcJ7g&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORCBUB0_pmQ5hKu1WTJnAVGI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the playlist I
started</a>
will have the full story plus lots more fun and building and exploring in
it. Hopefully I'll be done just in time for the release of DS2! (and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GTA6</a>, it's going to be a busy
year for gaming next year!)</p>

            <p>My association with Textual works on two levels: on the one hand, sure, it's
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">currently my day job</a>; on the other
hand it's a FOSS project that I'm keen to support so <em>"free time me"</em> tries
to work with it and support others working with it too. For this reason
you'll often see me being terminally<sup id="fnref:114-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:114-1">1</a></sup> online in the Textual Discord,
trying to answer questions as they come up, every waking free moment.</p>
<p>Almost without exception the people who ask for help are appreciative and
ask in the spirit of wanting help and wanting to work together with whoever
is helping them to get an answer. That... that's actually quite a cool thing
to be part of. I like the sense of community that comes from someone going
<em>"bah I'm trying to do this thing and it isn't working PLEASE HELP!"</em>.</p>
<p>And then... well, let's just say that sometimes the odd question will crop
up that seems to be asked from a less collaborative position.</p>
<p>Without wanting to appear to dunk on an individual (I don't wish to), I want
to break down an example that happened yesterday. For some background, I'd
been AFK all day, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/111867694675165507" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">having a wonderful time in town with a
friend</a>, shopping,
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/111867942313370807" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lunch</a>, a movie, that sort
of thing. A nicely-chilled day where I didn't even look at the Discord
notifications that had popped up on my watch and phone.</p>
<p>However, later on that evening, finally home and flopped on the sofa, I saw
a question pop up that, while lacking <a href="https://label.dev/articles/minimal-reproducible-example/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">any useful
detail</a> and
possibly suffering a wee bit from being <a href="https://label.dev/articles/xy-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an XY
problem</a>, the immediate answer was
clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>BadIdentifier: 'test.udp_json_client-input' is an invalid id; identifiers must
contain only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens, and must not begin with
a number.</tt></p>
<p>????????????????? a dot isn't allowed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I say: it lacks context and detail, and the number of question marks
doesn't really clarify much, but the core question that seems to be at play
here is <em>"is it true that a full stop can't be used as part of the ID of a
widget?"</em>.</p>
<p>The answer is: no, it can't. There's a reason for that too, and if someone
were to take a step back for a moment and think about how IDs play a part in
queries and how they'd be used in a stylesheet, the reason for that might
pop out. So, to help the person asking the question walk in the direction of
the answer, I reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you come to query that how would the parser know it’s not ID “test”
combined with a class, if dot was allowed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we go on, to illustrate my point, consider this ID: <code>foo.bar</code>. When
you come to query that back, or use it in a stylesheet, how would <code>#foo.bar</code>
look? Is it a widget with the ID <code>foo.bar</code>; or is it a widget with the id
<code>foo</code> and the class <code>bar</code>?</p>
<p>As far as Textual's CSS is concerned, it would be the latter.</p>
<p>But at this point it didn't seem necessary to get into all that detail; I
like to try and assume knowledge on the part of the person asking the
question, sans any other evidence, so for the moment I'll assume a <em>"oh,
right, yeah, that's a damn good point"</em> kind of reply. Or if not, perhaps a
<em>"I don't quite follow, could you explain?"</em> reply, in which case I'm happy
to go into all the detail.</p>
<p>The reply was neither:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why are element ID and classes co-mingled?</p>
<p>this was previously allowed so your question doesn't really make sense to
me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I'm confused. Asking why element IDs and classes <em>are</em> co-mingled seems
odd; but I'm used to chatting with people who don't have English as a first
language so I'm going to assume it's just a wording choice; but the latter
part is very odd: this has <em>never</em> been allowed. Or, more to the point...
without any proper context I can't really appreciate what claim is being
made here.</p>
<p>You see... <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3954" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I did notice a bug in Textual recently, when it came to widget
IDs</a>. Long story short:
when you set your ID for the widget in your code, no actual validation of
the ID was being done. This was an oversight <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/4032" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that was fixed in the latest
release</a>.</p>
<p>But knowing that that's the case would be guesswork on my part; I'm also
fresh at my desk after a day out; I'm probably not quite in the
coding/Textual zone yet, so rather than try and guess half of the
conversation, it's easier to just ask the person who is asking. So I ask
them to restate the question, and give some more background.</p>
<p>The reply is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the objective is to put a string like test.udp_json_client-input as the
label of a tab, which previously just used the ID property. from skimming
release notes, is it better to explicitly set the label, and then assign
something compliant for the ID separately?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait... what? I thought we were talking about valid widget IDs, now we're
talking about tabs and labels? Do we mean <code>TabbeContent</code> and the labels of a
<code>TabPane</code>? This is a bit different. So I'm sat there trying to figure out
this person's thought process so I can offer the help they're after and this
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>okay @davep, you have a real bug. --content-tab- prefix is not ephemeral.
if I create a tab and grab .id, that prefix comes with it, so if you save
it for later and try to set .active, assigning .active doesn't agree that
there is a tab --content-tab-thing</p>
<p>so I need to de-mangle the name manually before assigning .active I guess?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wut? Like... wut? Okay, we do seem to be talking about <code>TabbedContent</code>, I
recognise the values being mentioned here; we did some work <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/3815" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">late on last
year</a> that added some
namespacing to parts of the <code>TabbedContent</code> widget in an effort to <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduce
some foot-gun
situations</a>.</p>
<p>But... there's no <code>.</code> being used in the IDs as part of that; why are we now
proclaiming a bug in an unrelated PR? That's quite the leap with zero
evidence. Like... sure, I'm <em>all</em> for being alerted to bugs and fixing them,
but this doesn't seem like that.</p>
<p>And then there's the <em>"so I need to..."</em> conclusion that also seems to have
no connection to the original question.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever done support will recognise this situation, I'm sure.
Someone has seen a problem, they've dug around a little and reached a
conclusion about what the cause is, and turns up looking for help with the
<em>conclusion</em> they've reached (very much a variant of <a href="https://label.dev/articles/xy-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a XY
problem</a>).</p>
<p>That almost never gets us where we want to go, so I do the obvious thing; I
try and reboot the question; I try and get us back to the start and try and
get some clarity; I try and encourage asking the question with zero
assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm afraid I'm still not really understanding your question, as it now no
longer seems to relate to what you very first asked. Perhaps you could
start again, ideally with an
<a href="https://label.dev/articles/minimal-reproducible-example/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MRE</a> of what
you're looking at and trying to do, for clarity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I figure, whatever the problem is, it can be illustrated with like a dozen
lines of code. Also, when asking people to do this, it often actually helps
them rubber-duck their own problem. There's been plenty of times on Discord
where someone's "found a bug" in Textual, they're asked to make an MRE of
it, and they come back and go <em>"oh, shoot, right, I did that and realised
the bug was in my code"</em>. It's cool when they happens; everyone learns
something.</p>
<p>So... no MRE comes back, but this is the reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to fix multiple breakages in my application from some recent
changes. Right now I can't wrap my head around what to assign a
tabbed_content.active for it to work how it did before (where if you have
a tab with ID sample, you can assign tabbed_content.active = "sample", but
you can't do that anymore)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not an MRE, I <em>can</em> work with this. It seems clear that they have a
<code>TabbedContent</code> where they have a <code>TabPane</code> with the ID <code>"sample"</code> and they
are struggling to make it the <code>active</code> tab by setting <code>active</code> to
<code>"sample"</code>. That seems hugely unlikely, this is what <code>TabbedContent</code> is all
about, I think we'd have noticed (I'm petty sure we've got unit tests that
cover this), but I'm game. I can test this. And the MRE I write will
illustrate there isn't a problem.</p>
<p>So I reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, I can only suggest that you make an MRE of the issue you're seeing.
For example, here's me making a set of tabs, the last of which has the ID
"four", and I set the active to "four":</p>

<p>Based on what they've most-recently said is the problem, I'm confident
they'll see that this MRE is their situation in a nutshell, and we can work
out from there and figure out what the problem is they're seeing and where
this <code>.</code> in their IDs is coming from (because I'm <em>very</em> confident it isn't
coming from the work that was done on <code>TabbedContent</code>).</p>
<p>This is good. We're getting close to heading down a good path; I can feel
it!</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/main/src/textual/widgets/_tabbed_content.py#L513</p>
<p>there's no way you can deny you just added a metric ton of shenanigans
with the tab ID stuff. I can't get it to work at all anymore (assigning
.active), but yes I will either come up with an MRE or find the bug and
let you know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, rather than back up a wee bit, work with the MRE I wrote for them so we
can take a walk through the problem, they instead decide to tell me that the
PR I did last year (which <em>still</em> isn't implicated in any of this outwith of
them seemingly assuming it's the cause of all the issues, presented with
zero evidence that it is) was simply <em>"a metric ton of shenanigans"</em>.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Stop!</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> how you ask for help.</p>
<p>This isn't how you ask for help from a product or service you pay for. This
<em>really</em> isn't how you ask for help from a Free Software project, where the
people who are offering you help are doing so in their free time because
they want people to be able to build cool things with it.</p>
<p>It really isn't hard at all to show just a wee bit of respect for people's
time and willingness to try and help you.</p>
<p>Now... I get it. I can imagine a scenario where someone has just updated
Textual and their application suddenly starts throwing all sorts of weird
and new errors. That happens. That happened to me <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Thursday evening just
gone</a>. But that's no
reason for approaching getting help like this.</p>
<p>The way to approach it is this: pin the problem dependency, perhaps publish
a new version of your application so there's no accidental update of the
dependency, then head to any of the help resources for the dependency has
and <em>work with people who want to help you to find the cause of the
problem</em>. Trust me, it'll go a lot faster if you work with them, take on
board suggestions (no matter how odd they might first appear), and really
don't call their code <em>"a metric ton of shenanigans"</em>.</p>
<p>The conclusion to all of this? The person asking the question eventually
found they were setting some widget's ID to an invalid ID; one with a <code>.</code> in
it. So as I suspected and wanted to walk them to: they had invalid IDs all
along and they only found out about this because ID validation was fixed.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day they'll retract the claim that my actually-unrelated code
that wasn't "just" released <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.46.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">but was from last
year</a> is <em>"a
metric ton of shenanigans"</em>. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>

            <p>I feel like I'm on a bit of a roll when it comes to building applications
for the terminal at the moment; while I'm still tinkering and improving
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tinboard</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OSHit</a>, I had the urge to tackle another
idea that's been on my TODO list for a while.</p>
<p>This is something <a href="https://github.com/davep/quiz.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I did for Emacs</a> back
in 2017 and I felt it was a <em>perfect</em> candidate for a Textual-based project.
It's a terminal-based trivia quiz game, using <a href="https://opentdb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Open Trivia
Database</a> as the source of questions.</p>
<p><img alt="Quizzical" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/quizzical.png#centre" /></p>
<p>I've just published an early version <a href="https://pypi.org/project/quizzical/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
PyPI</a>; it still needs some polish and I
have a few other ideas for it, but as it stands I feel it's a fun little
game to mess around with.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty straightforward: you can run it up and create lots of
different quizzes, there are various parameters you can use to create lots
of different kinds of challenges:</p>
<p><img alt="Building a new quiz" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/new-quiz.png#centre" /></p>
<p>Once you're created a quiz, you can run it and answer away:</p>
<p><img alt="An example question" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/question.png" /></p>
<p>Right now the idea is that you answer by pressing either <kbd>1</kbd>,
<kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>4</kbd> (or just <kbd>1</kbd> or
<kbd>2</kbd> for true/false questions); when I get a moment I'll also enable
mouse support for selecting an answer too (honestly I feel
keyboard-answering feels far more natural).</p>
<p>Once the quiz is done you can review your answers and see which were right
and which were wrong:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing results" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/results.png#centre" /></p>
<p>As I say: there's a bunch of other things I want to add to this (keeping
track of scores, adding session token support to reduce the chances of
repeat questions, etc), but this felt like a good spot to make a v0.1.0
available if anyone else wanted to have a play.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/quizzical/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from PyPi</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/davep/quizzical" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source is available over on
GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>Just a wee catch-up post about OSHit, <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my terminal-based HackerNews
browser</a>. Over the past couple of weeks I've
made some small changes, so I thought I'd make mention of what I've done.</p>
<p>As of v0.5.0, which I released earlier today, I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a quick way of following links while viewing a comment. While a
  comment is highlighted you can press <kbd>l</kbd> to follow a link; if
  there's more than one link in the comment a menu will be shown and you can
  select which one to follow.</li>
<li>Added support for viewing polls. Polls seem to be few and far between on
  HackerNews, so when I published the first version of OSHit I didn't have
  one to hand to test any code against. Eventually one turned up and broke
  OSHit (on purpose; I wanted to see when that happened) so I could then add
  the code to load polls and show them. Right now it just shows scores; I
  might do actual charts at some point.</li>
<li>Added optional item numbers in the lists; turned on/off with
  <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far all small things, but handy little improvements. There's still a nice
TODO list in the README and I will slowly work through it. Along with
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tinboard</a> these are two applications
that have absolutely turned into "daily drivers", so they're going to get a
lot of tweaking over the next few weeks, probably even months.</p>

            <p>Last week I was wrestling with some Textual code, trying to get something to
lay out on the screen "just so". On the whole this isn't too tricky at all,
and for those times where it might feel tricky <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/how-to/design-a-layout/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there's some advice
available on how to go about
it</a>. But in this case
I was trying to do a couple of "on the edge" things and one thing I really
needed to know was what particular part of the display was being "caused" by
what container or widget<sup id="fnref:20-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment anyway, Textual doesn't have a full-blown devtools with
all the bells and whistles; not like in your average web browser. It does
have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a devtools</a>, but not
with all the fancy DOM-diving stuff the above would have needed.</p>
<p>What I needed was the equivalent of <code>print</code>-debugging but with a
point-and-ask interface. Now, I actually <em>do</em> often do <code>print</code>-debugging
with Textual apps only I use
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.notify" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>notify</code></a>;
this time though <code>notify</code> wasn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>I needed something that would let me point at a widget and say <em>"show me
stuff about this"</em>. Something that happens when the mouse hovers over a
widget. Something like... <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#tooltips" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
tooltip</a>!</p>
<p>So that was easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">widget</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span><span class="p">)]:</span>
        <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tooltip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="si">!r}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ancestors_with_self</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Suddenly I could hover my mouse over a bit of space on the screen and get a
"traceback" of sorts for what "caused" it.</p>
<p>I posted this little hack to <code>#show-and-tell</code> on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discord
server</a> and someone mentioned it would be
handy if it also showed the CSS for the widget too. That was simple enough
because every widget has a <code>styles.css</code> property that is the CSS for the
widget, as a string.</p>
<p>After that I didn't think much more about it; until today.</p>
<p>Looking back, one thing I realised is that adding the CSS information
<code>on_mount</code> wasn't quite good enough, as it would only show me the state of
CSS when the mount happened, not at the moment I inspect the widget. I
needed the tooltip to be dynamic.</p>
<p>Thing is... Textual tooltips can't be functions (which would be the obvious
approach to make it dynamic); so there was no way to get this on-the-fly
behaviour I wanted.</p>
<p>Except there was! The type of
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/widget/#textual.widget.Widget.tooltip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>tooltip</code></a>
is <code>RenderableType</code>. So that means I could assign it an object that is a
Rich renderable; that in turn means I could write a <code>__rich__</code> method for a
class that wraps a widget and then reports back what it can see every time
it's called.</p>
<p>In other words, via one step of indirection, I could get the <em>"call a
function each time"</em> approach I was after!</p>
<p>It works a treat too.</p>
<p>All of which is a long-winded way of saying I now have a <code>print</code>-debug-level
DOM inspector tool for when I'm building applications with Textual:</p>
<p><img alt="textual-dominfo in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/15/textual-dominfo.png#centre" /></p>
<p>If this sounds handy to you, you can grab the code too. Install it into your
development environment with <code>pip</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-dominfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then attach it to your app or screen or some top-level widget you're
interested in via <code>on_mount</code>; for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>def on_mount(self) -&gt; None:
    from textual_dominfo import DOMInfo
    DOMInfo.attach_to(self)
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then hover away with that mouse cursor and inspect all the things!
Whatever you do though, <em>don't</em> make it part of your runtime, and don't keep
it installed; just make it a development dependency.</p>

            <p>The idea for this one popped into my head while on the bus back from Textual
Towers this evening. So after dinner and some nonsense on TV I had to visit
my desk and do a quick hack.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>textual-countdown</code></a>, a
subtle but I think useful countdown widget for Textual applications.</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Countdown in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/11/textual-countdown.gif" /></p>
<p>The idea is that you compose it somewhere into your screen, and when you
start the countdown the bar highlights and then starts to shrink down to
"nothing" in the middle of its display. When the countdown ends a message is
posted so you can then perform the task that was being waited for in an
event handler.</p>
<p>Not really a novel thing, I've seen this kind of thing before on the web;
I'm sure we all have. I just thought it would be a fun idea for Textual
applications too.</p>
<p>I envisage using this where, perhaps, an application needs to wait for an
API-visiting cooldown period, or perhaps as a subtle countdown for a
question in a quiz; something like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like it's something useful for your Textual
applications, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-countdown/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it's now available from
PyPi</a> and, of course, the
source is over <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>This is actually the second release of OSHit since <a href="/2024/01/01/oshit.html">I first announced it a
week back</a>, and I'll get to that other release in a
moment.</p>
<p>I've just published v0.2.0, which isn't a very substantial release, but
which bumps the required version of Textual to
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">v0.47.1</a> and
has some fun with <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the new nested CSS
feature</a>.</p>
<p>Underlying the point of this release was me taking a <em>"real world"</em>
application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in
part to get a feel for how and when it's useful, but also to give it a
proper test in a <em>"proper"</em> application. In doing so <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3969" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I think I've found one
bug</a>.</p>
<p>Dogfooding is always a good idea.</p>
<p>The main visible change in this release is I've played around with the look
of the comments dialog a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="OSHit you have comments" src="/attachments/2024/01/07/oshit-comments.png" /></p>
<p>I'm still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I
started out with.</p>
<p>Another change I made was also to the comments dialog. Before, if you
performed the <em>"expand comments"</em> action on a comment card that already had
its comments expanded, it would move focus to the first child comment; this
was a deliberate choice that felt right at the time. Having used the app for
a few days now I've realised that making it an open/close toggle is far more
useful. So that's what I've done.</p>
<p>Now... as for <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/releases/tag/v0.1.1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the previous
release</a> I mentioned
above. That was a fun one.</p>
<p>Back when I released v0.1.0 some joker decided that it would be fun to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38831083" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submit the blog post about it to the Orange
Site</a>. The comments there
went as you'd expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph, ignoring the tool itself.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in self-reflective way.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in a <em>"I never see the problem"</em>
  way.</li>
<li>One or two did the usual <em>"why even bother building that when
  <code>$TOOL_OF_CHOICE</code> exists?"</em> dance to show their terminal purity.</li>
<li>One or two posted genuinely useful links to other similar projects.</li>
<li>The biggest tree of comments was kind of a fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>One comment caught my eye though; someone reported having a problem running
it. My initial thought on reading it was <em>"my dude, seriously, you're going
to report the problem in some random comment on HN rather than raise an
issue with the author?!?"</em>.</p>
<p>For once <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues/2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was wrong to be so cynical</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I'd been intentionally
reckless while writing the original code, and hadn't <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/pull/4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gone back to the API
code I'd written and made it behave</a>
before doing the initial release.</p>
<p>All of which is to say: if you run into a problem with some FOSS project, be
like <a href="https://github.com/mihaitodor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@mihaitodor</a>. Issue that thing so the
developer gets to know about it; don't assume they'll be reading some random
comment section, social media site or Discord server!</p>
<p>That and don't make 500+ HTTP requests at once; that might not end well for
some.</p>

            <p>I know I'm not alone in having a relationship with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the orange
site</a> that is... weird. I generally dislike
the culture there, it's almost impossible to read any of the comments
without being frustrated about the industry I work in or am adjacent to and
some of the people who inhabit it; but as a link aggregator of stuff I might
find interesting... I honestly can't think of anywhere better. So, yes, I've
been a fairly avid reader of HackerNews for many years, and have even had an
account there for over 4 years.</p>
<p>Given this, for a wee while now, I've been meaning to knock up a
terminal-based client for it using
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textual</a>.</p>
<p>So after work on <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a> settled down I got
the urge to start a new pet project (not abandoning Tinboard, I'm still
going to be tweaking and extending it of course) and finally knocking up
that client seemed like the one.</p>
<p><em>Orange Site Hit</em> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="OShit" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index.png" /></p>
<p>It's worth making clear from the very start: this is a read-only reader.
There is no logging in, there is no voting, there is no posting of things.
This is a client built with <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their own
API</a> and it doesn't provide such a thing;
at least not now and despite me seeing past promises that this will change,
there's no API for doing that sort of thing.<sup id="fnref:13-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea of this application is you can run it up in the terminal, check the
top, best and latest from the categories provided by the API, perhaps dive
off into your web browser if needed, and then got on with other things.</p>
<p>It's there for when you're in the terminal you just <em>need</em> your hit of the
orange site.</p>
<p>The main screen of the app revolves around the index of items, most of which
are going to be stories. You can see an example of that above. For people
who prefer things to be slightly less cramped, I've also added a "relaxed
layout" mode too:</p>
<p><img alt="The index in relaxed mode" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index-relaxed.png" /></p>
<p>From the index you can head off into your web-browser by hitting
<kbd>Enter</kbd> on any item; if the item is a story that links to somewhere
that link will be opened; if it's something more like <em>AskHN</em>, or a job,
it'll open the related page on HackerNews itself.</p>
<p>Pressing <kbd>u</kbd> with an item selected will let you view the details
for the user who posted the item:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the details of a user" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-user-dialog.png" /></p>
<p>If you're the sort of person who wants to torture themselves by reading the
comments (oh come on we all do it!), there's a comment reader/navigator too.
With an item selected press <kbd>c</kbd> and the comment dialog will open:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the real meat of HackerNews" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-comments.png" /></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the navigation within that dialog is fine; although I can see some
scope for improvement. At the moment it uses a widget-per-comment (actually,
it's at least 4 widgets per comment), which is fine and Textual handles that
without an issue, even on items with lots of comments, but longer-term I can
see me having some fun using <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#line-api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the line
API</a> to build a
super-efficient comment presentation and navigation widget.</p>
<p>That's it for now; it feels like a good v0.1.0 spot to be in. There are a
bunch of things I still want to do with it (better cleaning up of the text,
perhaps with some markup support so links get handled, etc; plus lots of
ways of searching for stuff), but I felt it was in a place where I could
start using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oshit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from PyPi</a>. The
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source is available over on GitHub</a>.</p>
