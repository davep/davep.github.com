            <p>For <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">about 2 and a half years
now</a> this blog has been built
with <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a>. For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).</p>
<p>There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.</p>
<p>Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.</p>
<p>The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.</p>
<p>The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
<a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>; a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.</p>
<p>At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'd
love to hear about
it</a>.</p>
<p>As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... that's a blog post to come.</p>
<p>I took lots of notes.</p>

<p>I honestly can't remember when I was first introduced to the idea of
RSS/Atom feeds, and the idea of having an aggregator or reader of some
description to keep up with updates on your favourite sites. It's got to be
over 25 years ago now. I can't remember what I used either, but I remember
using one or two readers that ran locally, right up until I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google
Reader</a>. Once I discovered that
I was settled.</p>
<p>As time moved on and I moved from platform to platform, and wandered into
the smartphone era, I stuck with Google Reader (and the odd client for it
here and there). It was a natural and sensible approach to consuming news
and updates. It also mostly felt like a solved problem and so felt nice and
stable.</p>
<p>So, of course, I was annoyed when Google killed it off, <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like so many useful
things</a>.</p>
<p>When this happened I dabbled with a couple of alternatives and, at some
point, finally settled on <a href="https://theoldreader.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TheOldReader</a>. Since
then it's been my "server" for feed subscriptions with me using desktop and
mobile clients to work against it.</p>
<p>But... I never found anything that worked for me that ran in the terminal.
Given <a href="/tag/terminal.html">I've got a thing for writing terminal-based
tools</a> it made sense I should have a go, and so
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OldNews</a> became my winter break project.</p>
<p><img alt="Reading an article in OldNews" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/reading.png" /></p>
<p>I've written it as a client application for <a href="https://github.com/theoldreader/api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the API of
TheOldReader</a>, and only for that, and
have developed it in a way that works well for me. All the functionality I
want and need is in there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add subscriptions</li>
<li>Rename subscriptions</li>
<li>Remove subscriptions</li>
<li>Add folders</li>
<li>Rename folders</li>
<li>Remove folders</li>
<li>Move subscriptions between folders</li>
<li>Mark read/unread</li>
<li>Read articles (that provide actual content in their feeds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently there's no support for starring feeds or interacting with the
whole "friend" system (honestly: while I see mention of it in the API, I
know nothing of that side of things and really don't care about it). As time
goes on I might work on that.</p>
<p>As with all of my other terminal-based applications, there's a rich command
palette that shows you what you can do, and also what keyboard shortcuts
will run those commands. While I do still need to work on some documentation
for the application (although you'd hope that anyone looking for an RSS
reader at this point would mostly be able to find their way around) the
palette is a good place to go looking for things you can do.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/command-palette.png" /></p>
<p>Plus there's a help screen too.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/help.png" /></p>
<p>If themes are your thing, there's themes:</p>
<p><img alt="Available themes" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/themes.png" />
<img alt="Gruvbox" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/gruvbox.png" />
<img alt="Textual Light" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/textual-light.png" />
<img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/nord.png" /></p>
<p>That's a small selection, and there's more to explore.</p>
<p>Also on the cosmetic front there's a simple compact mode, which toggles
between two ways of showing the navigation menu, the article lists and the
panel headers.</p>
<p><img alt="Not compact" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/not-compact.png" />
<img alt="Compact" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/compact.png" /></p>
<p>OldNews has been a daily-driver for a wee while now, while also under active
development. I think I've covered all the main functions I want and have
also shaken out plenty of bugs, so today's the day to call it v1.0.0 and go
from there.</p>
<p>If you're a user of TheOldReader and fancy interacting with it from the
terminal too then it's out there to try out. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oldnews/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
PyPI</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and running with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oldnews
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed using
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>uv<span class="w"> </span>tool<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oldnews
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you don't have <code>uv</code> installed you can use <a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uvx.sh</a> to
perform the installation. For GNU/Linux or macOS or similar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>-LsSf<span class="w"> </span>uvx.sh/oldnews/install.sh<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>or on Windows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>powershell<span class="w"> </span>-ExecutionPolicy<span class="w"> </span>ByPass<span class="w"> </span>-c<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;irm https://uvx.sh/oldnews/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once installed, run the <code>oldnews</code> command.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is useful to someone else; meanwhile I'll be using it more
and more. If you need help, or have any ideas, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise an
issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/discussions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">start a

<p><img alt="A chiral crystal" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/chiral.jpeg#centre" /></p>
<p>Death Stranding, along with its sequel, is my absolute favourite video game
ever, and probably one of my favourite pieces of fiction ever too; I've
watched and read a lot about the game (not to mention I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORDJd_VYhF74e6Mapf8oHp8i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">played both
releases a ton
too</a>).
A good few months back I was watching <a href="https://youtu.be/_GhSXMMJp0E?si=dGxAJlgLi5BBKCkM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video about the making of the first
game</a> and during the
video, <a href="https://youtu.be/_GhSXMMJp0E?si=z6FKH_FNfFMEozAe&amp;t=1635" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around the 27:20
mark</a>, the narrator
says the phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the game's core values of solidarity, empathy, and patience</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stood out to me. There was something about that phrase and what it
meant given my experiences in Death Stranding and Death Stranding 2; it
spoke to me enough that I jotted it down and kept coming back to it and
thinking about it. It was a phrase I couldn't get out of my head.</p>
<p>Around the same time I was also doing a lot of thinking about, and
note-writing about, code reviews. Although I've been working in software
development<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for a few decades now (I started in July 1989), I was quite
late to the whole process of code review -- at least in the way we talk
about it today. This mostly comes down to the fact that for a lot of my time
I either worked in very small companies or I was the only developer around.</p>
<p>Given this, thinking about my own approach to reviews is something I've only
really been doing for the past few years. I've made personal notes about it,
read posts and articles about it, I've had conversations about it; my
thoughts and feelings about it have drifted a little but seem to have
settled.</p>
<p>The idea of that phrase from the Death Stranding video crept into this
thought process, as I felt it nicely summed up what a good code review would
look and feel like. Weirdly I also realised that, perhaps, the things I like
and value about Death Stranding are also the things I like, value, and want
to embody when it comes to code reviews.</p>
<p>One of the big selling points for me, with Death Stranding, is the
asynchronous multiplayer aspect of it; the reason Kojima calls it a "Strand
type game". I have my game, I have my goal, but other people can indirectly
affect it, either doing work in their game that leaks into mine in a
beneficial way, or by leaking into mine in a way that I have to clean up.
There's something really satisfying about this asynchronous collaboration.
That feels similar to the collective effort of working in a single
repository, each person working on their own branch or PR, sometimes in
tandem, sometimes in series, sometimes to the benefit of each other and
sometimes in ways that block each other.</p>
<p>But that's not the point here. There's a similarity if I think about it, but
I don't want to get too carried away on that line of thought. It's the
phrase from the video I care about; it's the approach of involving
solidarity, empathy and patience I want to think about more.</p>
<h2 id="solidarity">Solidarity</h2>
<p><img alt="In the mountains" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/mountains.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This, for me, is all about where you position yourself when you approach
reviewing code. I sense things only work well if you view the codebase as
something with common ownership. I've worked on and with a codebase where
the original author invited others in to collaborate, but where they
constantly acted as a gatekeeper, and often as a gatekeeper who was
resistant to their own contributions being reviewed, and it was an
exhausting experience.</p>
<p>I believe the key here is to work against a "your code" vs "my standard"
approach, instead concentrating on an "our repository" view. That's not to
say that there shouldn't be standards and that they shouldn't be maintained
-- there should be and they should be -- but more to say that they should be
agreed upon, mutually understood to be worthwhile, and that any callout of a
standard not being applied is seen as a good and helpful thing.</p>
<p>The driving force here should be the shared intent, and how the different
degrees of knowledge and experience can come together to express that
intent. If a reviewer can see issues with a submission, with a proposed
change or addition to the codebase, the ideal approach is to highlight them
in such a way as to make it feel like <em>we</em> discovered them, not that <em>I</em>
discovered them and <em>you</em> should sort it out. Depending on the degree of
proposed change, this might actually be expressed by (if you're using
GitHub, for example) using the "Suggested Change" feature to directly feed
back into the PR, or perhaps for something a little more complex, or the
offer to pair up to work on the solution.</p>
<h2 id="empathy">Empathy</h2>
<p><img alt="Sam and Fragile" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/Sam-and-Fragile.jpeg" /></p>
<p>As someone who has written a lot of code, and so written a lot of bugs and
made a lot of bad design choices, I feel empathy is the easiest of the three
words to get behind and understand, but possibly the hardest one to actually
put into practice.</p>
<p>When you look at a PR, it's easy to see code, to see those design choices,
and to approach the reading as if you were the one who had written it,
assessing it through that lens. In my own experience, this is where I find
myself writing and re-writing my comments during a review. As much as
possible I try and ask the author <em>why</em> they've taken a particular approach.
It could be, perhaps, that I've simply missed a different perspective they
have. If that's the case I'll learn something about the code (and about
them); if that isn't the case I've invited them to have a second read of
their contribution. It seems to me that this benefits everyone.</p>
<p>I feel that where I land with this is the idea of striving to act less like
a critic and more like a collaborator, and in doing so aiming to add to an
atmosphere of psychological safety. Nobody should feel like there's a
penalty to getting something "wrong" in a contribution; they should ideally
feel like they've learnt a new "gotcha" to be mindful of in the future (both
as an author and a reviewer). Done right the whole team, and the work,
benefits.</p>
<h2 id="patience">Patience</h2>
<p><img alt="Arriving at the plate gate" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/Plate-Gate.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The patience aspect of this view of reviews, for me, covers a few things.
There's the patience that should be applied when reading over the code;
there's the patience that should be applied when walking someone through
feedback and suggestions; and there's the patience needed by the whole team
to not treat code reviews as a speed bump on the road to getting work over
the line. While patience applies to other facets of a review too, I think
these are the most important parts.</p>
<p>In a work environment I think it's the last point -- that of the team's
collective patience -- that is the most difficult to embody and protect.
Often we'll find ourselves in a wider environment that employs a myopic view
of progress and <em>getting things done</em>, where the burn-down chart for the
sprint is all that matters. In that sort of environment a code review can
often be seen, by some, as a frustrating hurdle to moving that little card
across that board. Cards over quality. Cards over sustainability.</p>
<p>It's my belief that this is one of those times where the phrase "slow down
to speed up" really does apply. For me, review time is where the team gets
to grow, to own the project, to own the code, to really apply the
development and engineering principles they want to embody. Time spent on a
review now will, in my experience, collectively save a lot more time later
on, as the team becomes more cohesive and increasingly employs a shared
intuition for what's right for the project.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-entirely-a-post-about-code-reviews">This is not (entirely) a post about code reviews</h2>
<p><img alt="Near the wind farm" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/Wind-Farm.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The thing with code reviews, or any other team activities, is they don't
exist in a vacuum. They take on the taste and smell of the culture in which
they operate. It's my experience that it doesn't matter how much solidarity,
empathy or patience you display during your day-to-day, if it's counter to
the culture in which you work it's always going to be exhausting, it's
always going to feel like a slog.</p>
<p>If leadership in technology, in software engineering, were to show more of
these three basic qualities, they'd start to appear like they realise that
they're working with actual humans, not producers of code; and I think we
need more of that now than at any time in the history of coding.</p>
<p>Since I first saw that video, and heard that phrase, and had it run around
my head, I've come to feel that it's not just a good mantra for code
reviews; I think it's a simple blueprint for what good tech leadership
should look like. If there was more "Strand-type" leadership in my chosen
industry I feel it would be more open, more accessible, would offer more
psychological safety and ultimately would result in teams, and projects,
that thrive.</p>

            <p>In the past few months, like a lot of folk in the Python world, I've been
won over by <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a>. When it comes to managing my
own projects my journey over the past few years as been
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>pipenv</code></a>, then
<a href="https://rye.astral.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>rye</code></a>, and then when rye was killed off I finally
swapped to <code>uv</code> (later than I should have, I realised in hindsight). At each
step I've found each tool cleaner, easier to work with and more
feature-rich.</p>
<p>There's no doubt in my mind that <code>uv</code> has done the most work to make
installing Python-based tools (or at least PyPI-based tools) <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as
friction-free an experience as
possible</a>.</p>
<p>Now I've discovered <a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uvx.sh</a>. The thing with <code>uv</code> is the
person installing your application first needs to get and install <code>uv</code>; this
site removes that friction. Now if someone wants to install
<a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> (for example) they should be able to
just do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>-LsSf<span class="w"> </span>uvx.sh/obs2nlm/install.sh<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>and away they go (assuming they have <a href="https://curl.se" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">curl</a> installed,
which is generally going to be far more likely than having <code>uv</code> installed).</p>
<p>Of course, there are <a href="https://www.djm.org.uk/posts/protect-yourself-from-non-obvious-dangers-curl-url-pipe-sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the usual caveats and
concerns</a>
about the <em>"just pipe this stuff via <code>sh</code> trust me bro"</em> approach, but if
you are comfortable with suggesting this kind of install method it looks
worth adding this to an application's installation documentation.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to start mentioning it as an option.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>After having knocked up <a href="/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html">obs2nlm the other day</a> I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: <a href="/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html">one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection</a>!</p>
<p>And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as <code>obs2nlm</code>, only it
uses <a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ngdb</code></a> to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be working a treat.</p>
<p><img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre" /></p>
<p>Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.</p>
<p>I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a <em>long</em>
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I <em>think</em> this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What are all the numbers in square brackets for?</p>
<p><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source <em>and linking to it</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre" /></p>
<p>so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.</p>
<p>If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:</p>
<p><img alt="No citations in the code" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre" /></p>
<p>So, given this, perhaps I can use the
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>--additional-instructions</code></a>
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak <code>ng2nlm</code> itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> exists.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>I'm sure I've mentioned a couple of times before that I've become quite the
fan of <a href="https://obsidian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. For the past few years, at any given
point, I've had a couple of vaults on the go. Generally I find such vaults a
really useful place to record things I'd otherwise forget, and of course as
a place to go back and look things up.</p>
<p>But... even then, it's easy enough to forget what you might have recorded
and know that you can even go back and look things up. Also I tend to find
that I can't quite figure out a good way of getting a good overview of what
I've recorded, over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: I've been playing around with Google's
<a href="https://notebooklm.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NotebookLM</a> as a tool to help research and
understand various topics. After doing this with my recent winter break
coding project (more on that in the future) I realised I really should get
serious about taking this approach with my Obsidian Vaults.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is far from novel, I'm sure lots of people have done similar
things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/vault2source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few months
ago</a>, had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> was born.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.</p>
<p>So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I <em>know</em> the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.</p>
<p>Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
<a href="/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html">I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things</a> and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in <a href="https://journey.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Journey</a> for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in <a href="https://evernote.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evernote</a>,
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textualize</a>. It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> will be handy for you.</p>

long had a bit of a thing for <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing tools for reading the content of
Norton Guide files</a>. I first used
Norton Guides back in the early 1990s thanks to the release of Clipper 5,
and later on in that decade I wrote my first couple of tools to turn guides
into HTML (and also wrote a Windows-based reader, then rewrote it, wrote one
for OS/2, wrote one for GNU/Linux, and so on).</p>
<p>One tool (<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2html</code></a>) got used by a few
sites on the 'net to publish all sorts of guides, but it's not something I
ever got into doing myself. Amusingly, from time to time, because I had a
credit on those sites as the author of the conversion tool, I'd get random
emails from people hoping I could help them with the topic of whatever guide
they'd been reading. Sometimes I could help, often not.</p>
<p>From what I've recently been told two of the biggest sites for this sort of
thing (they might even have been the same site, or one a copy of the other,
I didn't really dive into them too much and wasn't sure who was behind them
anyway) have long since gone offline. This means that, as far as I can tell,
a huge collection of knowledge from the DOS days is a lot harder to get to,
if it hasn't disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>This makes me kind of sad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> digging a little, one of the sites was called
<code>www.clipx.net</code> and it looks to have long-since gone offline. It is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213123739/http://www.clipx.net/ng/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on
archive.org though</a>.
The other was <code>x-hacker.org</code> which, digging a wee bit more, seems to have
been a copy of what was on clipx.net.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I had an idea: having <a href="/2025/03/24/ng2web.html">recently polished up my replacement for
ng2html</a>, why not use that to build my own site
that publishes the guides I have? So I set about it.</p>
<p>There's one wrinkle to this though. While the other sites seemed to just
publish every NG file they got their hands on, I'd prefer to try and do it
like this: publish every guide I have in my collection <em>that I have a
licence or permission to publish</em>; or as near as possible<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Given all of this,
<a href="https://norton-guides.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">norton-guides.davep.dev</a> has been born.
The repository that drives it <a href="https://github.com/davep/norton-guides" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is on
GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/davep/norton-guides/wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I have a wiki
page</a> that lists all the guides
I have that I could possibly publish, showing what I know about the
copyright/licence of each one and what the publishing state is.</p>
<p><img alt="Snapshot of the site" src="/attachments/2025/12/12/norton-guides.png" /></p>
<p>So with this, I'm putting out a call for help: if you remember the days of
Norton Guide help files, if you have Norton Guide help files I don't have,
and especially if you are the copyright-holder of any of these files and you
can extend me the permission to open them up, or if you know the right
people and can get me in touch with them, <a href="mailto:davep@davep.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DROP ME A LINE</a>!</p>
<p>I'd also love to have others join me in this... quest. So if you want to
contribute to the repository and help build it up I'd also love to hear from
you.</p>

<p>Back in the very early days of my involvement with
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textualize</a>, while looking for fun things to
build to test out the framework and find problems with it, I created
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>textual-astview</code></a>. The idea was
pretty simple: exercise Textual's
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Tree</code></a> widget by using it to
display the output of Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abstract syntax tree
module</a>.</p>
<p>While the code still works, Textual has moved on a lot, as has my approach
to building applications with Textual, and so I've been wanting to do a
ground-up rewrite of it. At the same time I was also thinking that it might
be interesting to build a tool that provides other ways of understanding how
your Python source gets turned into runnable code; with this in mind I've
ended up building a terminal-based application called DHV.</p>
<p><a href="https://dhv.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="DHV in action" src="/attachments/2025/07/19/dhv.gif" /></a></p>
<p>The idea is pretty straightforward: you type in, paste in, or load up,
Python code, and you get a real-time display of what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resulting
bytecode</a> and abstract syntax
tree would be.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a particular bit of code looks like under the
hood, or wondered if one particular approach to a problem is "more
efficient"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> than another, or just wondered to yourself if <code>1+1</code> ends up
being a complex operation or simply gets turned into <code>2</code>, this tool might be
useful to experiment and see.</p>
<p>As of now DHV only works with Python 3.13. The main reason for this is that
the Python <code>dis</code> module is a bit of a moving target and has had some
noticeable interface changes over the past few versions. When I find some
time I might work on making DHV a little more backward-compatible. But for
now keep this in mind: when you're looking at the results for some code
you're looking at what Python 3.13 (or later) would do, earlier Pythons may
differ.</p>
<p>DHV is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/dhv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dhv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
PyPI</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>dhv
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you're a fan of
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a> and friends
you can install it like this:</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Norton Guide readers</a> or
the <a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories&amp;q=5x5&amp;type=&amp;language=&amp;sort=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5x5
puzzle</a>,
code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto
exercises. I've written versions in many languages, and messed with plots in
some different environments, as varied as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ytRZrHL34" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in VR on the
web</a> to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Self-Documenting-Mandelbrot-by-davepearson/1341910.0S66D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wearable
items</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">my involvement with
Textualize</a> I
<a href="https://github.com/davep/trMandelbrot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a deliberately worst-approach
version</a> using that framework. The
whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also
stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job.</p>
<p>Later on I did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second version that targets
Textual</a>. This time it did a
better job and was the catalyst for building
<a href="https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>. This version was
intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example
application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible
version mentioned above, I still wasn't 100% happy with the way it worked.</p>
<p>Recently I did some maintenance work on <code>textual-canvas</code>, cleaning up the
repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python
projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at
<code>textual-mandelbrot</code> and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn't really
sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not
that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick
off a fresh stand-alone application.</p>
<p><a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Complexitty</a> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Complexitty on startup" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty.png" /></p>
<p>Right now the application has all the same features as the <code>mandelexp</code>
application that came with <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>, plus a couple more. Also
it's built on top of <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the common core
library</a> I've been putting
together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on
<a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ATODO%20label%3AEnhancement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'll add more
features</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed in with Complexitty" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-red.png" /></p>
<p>As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with
comprehensive help for commands and key bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-help.png" /></p>
<p>and there's also a command palette that helps you discover (and run)
commands and their keyboard bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-commands.png" /></p>
<p>Complexitty is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via

<p>That's from the rcs log <a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng/blob/master/w3ng.c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for the source for
<code>w3ng</code></a>, a tool I wrote so
I could read Norton Guide files in my web browser, served by Apache, running
on my GNU/Linux server in my office. The tool itself was written as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CGI</a> tool (remember
them?).</p>
<p>I believe I posted about this to <code>comp.lang.clipper</code> and pretty quickly some
folk asked if it might be possible to do a version that would write the
whole guide as a collection of HTML files for static hosting, rather than
serving them from a cgi-bin utility. That seemed like a sensible idea and
so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> * Revision 1.1  1996/03/16 09:49:00  davep

<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html/blob/master/ng2html.c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2html</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>Fast forward around a quarter of a century and I decided it would be fun to
write <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/">a library for Python that reads Norton Guide
files</a>, and a tool called <code>ng2web</code> was the
first test I wrote of it, designed as a more flexible replacement for
<code>ng2html</code>. I've tweaked and tinkered with the tool since I first created it,
but never actually "finished" it.</p>
<p>That's changed today. I've just released v1.0.0 of <code>ng2web</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="A page generated with ng2web" src="/attachments/2025/03/24/ng2web.png" /></p>
