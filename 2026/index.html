        <div class="post-content">
            <p>This morning, with <a href="/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html">my experiment with
Copilot</a> having settled down a
little bit, I thought I might try and use the result for another little
experiment. For a long time now I've maintained a (currently lapsed)
photoblog. It was always very much tied to <em>"the site formerly known as
twitter"</em> and, since I fully erased my account after the site turned into a
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nazi bar</a>, I've not done anything
to update how it gets populated.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking: I have a full backup of all the images in a couple of
places; perhaps with a bit of coding (and some help from "the AIs") I can
revive it using <a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>?</p>
<p>I tinkered for a wee bit and mostly got something going (albeit I'm going to
have to do some work to back-port the actual dates and times of some earlier
images, and there's a load of work to do to somehow pull out all the tags).
But then I hit a small hitch.</p>
<p>When building BlogMore I made the decision to let it write both the code
<em>and</em> the documentation. It documented a couple of features I never asked
for, but which seemed sensible so I never questioned. On the other hand
neither did I test them at the time (because they weren't important to what
I needed).</p>
<p>It's the exact reason I added this warning at the start of the
documentation:</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-warning">
<div class="admonition-title">⚠️ Warning</div>
<div class="admonition-content">
<p>BlogMore is an experiment in using GitHub Copilot to develop a whole
project from start to finish. As such, almost every part of this
documentation was generated by Copilot and what it knows about the
project. Please keep this in mind.</p>
<p>From what I can see at the moment the documentation is broadly correct,
and I will update and correct it as I work through it and check it myself.
Of course, I will welcome reports of problems or fixes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With this warning in mind, and with the intention of working through the
documentation and testing its claims, I decided to test out one of the
features when building up the new photoblog.</p>
<p>Whereas with this blog I keep all the posts <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/tree/main/content" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a flat
structure</a>,
this time around I thought I'd try out this (taken from the
Copilot-generated BlogMore documentation):</p>
<hr />
<p>BlogMore is flexible about how you organise your posts. Here are some common patterns:</p>
<p><strong>Flat structure</strong> (all posts in one directory):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>posts/
  ├── hello-world.md
  ├── python-tips.md
  └── web-development.md
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Files can be date-prefixed (e.g., <code>2026-02-18-hello-world.md</code>) and BlogMore will automatically remove the date prefix from the URL slug. The post will still use the <code>date</code> field from frontmatter for chronological ordering.</p>
<p><strong>Organised by date</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>posts/
  ├── 2024/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   │   └── hello-world.md
  │   └── 02/
  │       └── python-tips.md
  └── 2025/
      └── 01/
          └── web-development.md
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Organised by topic</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>posts/
  ├── python/
  │   ├── decorators.md
  │   └── type-hints.md
  └── web/
      ├── css-grid.md
      └── javascript-tips.md
</code></pre></div>

<hr />
<p>Using the hierarchy approach, especially with dates, seemed ideal! I'd drop
the actual images in such a hierarchy, and also drop the Markdown posts in a
parallel hierarchy too. Perfect!</p>
<p>So I set it all up to do that, fired up <code>blogmore serve</code>, visited the URL
and... <code>No posts yet</code>. What the hell?</p>
<p>So I checked the code for BlogMore and, sure enough, despite the fact the
documentation was selling me on this handy way to organise my posts, no such
feature existed!</p>
<p>As an experiment <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/issues/129" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I then asked Copilot what the heck was going
on</a>. Much as I expected,
rather than coming back with an answer to the question, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/130" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it went right ahead
and fixed it instead</a>. Which is
fine, that's where I would have taken this, but I do wish it would answer
the question first.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-note">
<div class="admonition-title">ℹ️ Note</div>
<div class="admonition-content">
<p>I imagine I could get an answer to the question if I took a more
conversational route with Copilot, rather than writing the question in an
issue and then assigning that issue to it. I must remember to try that at
some point.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, yeah, unsurprisingly Copilot flat out lied<sup id="fnref:21-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21-1">1</a></sup> in the documentation. I'm
not in the least bit shocked by this and, as I said, I fully expected this.
But it was amusing to have an example of this turn up so early in the
documentation, in such a glaring way, and in a way that was so easily fixed
(really, it was just a swap of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Path.glob</code></a>
to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Path.rglob</code></a>).</p>
<p>As I play with this more it's going to be fun to see what other bold claims
turn out to not be true; or perhaps even the reverse: what neat features
lurk in the code that haven't been documented.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:21-1">
<p>Yes, as I mentioned yesterday, that's an anthropomorphism. Folk who
take such things as an indication that you don't understand "AI" might

            <h2 id="another-itch-to-scratch">Another itch to scratch</h2>
<p>As <a href="/2026/02/19/a-new-engine.html">I mentioned yesterday</a>, I've been a happy
user of <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a> for a couple or so years now, but
every so often there's a little change or tweak I'd like to make that
requires diving deeper into the templates and the like and... I go <em>"eh,
I'll look at it some time soon"</em>. Another thought that often goes through my
head at those times is <em>"I should build my own static site generator that
works exactly how I want"</em> -- because really any hacker with a blog has to
do that at some point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I've had free access to <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub
Copilot</a> attached to <a href="https://github.com/davep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my GitHub
account</a> for some time now, and I've hardly used
it. At the same time -- the past few months especially -- I've been watching
the rise of agents as coding tools, as well as the rise of advocates for
them. Worse still, I've seen people I didn't expect to be advocates for
giving up on coding turning to these tools and suddenly writing rationales
in favour of them.</p>
<p>So, suddenly, the idea popped into my head: I should write my own static
site generator that I'll use for my blog, and I should try and use GitHub
Copilot to write 100% of the code, and documentation, and see how far I get.
I doing so I might firm up my opinions about where we're all going with
this.</p>
<p>The requirements were going to be pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a static site generator that turns Markdown files into a
  website.</li>
<li>It should be blog-first in its design.</li>
<li>It should support non-blog-post pages too.</li>
<li>It should be written in Python.</li>
<li>It should use Jinja2 for templates.</li>
<li>It should have a better archive system than I ever got out of my Pelican
  setup.</li>
<li>It should have categories, tags, and all the usual metadata stuff you'd
  expect from a site where you're going to share content from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the requirements would drift and expand as I went along and I had
some new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>To kick things off, I created <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my repo</a>,
and then opened Copilot and typed out a prompt to get things going. Here's
what I typed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a blog-oriented static site generation engine. It should be built in
Python, the structure of the repository should match that of my preferences
for Python projects these days (see https://github.com/davep/oldnews and
take clues from the makefile; I like uv and ruff and Mypy, etc).</p>
<p>Important features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is written in markdown</li>
<li>All metadata for a post should come from frontmatter</li>
<li>It should use Jinja2 for the output templates</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, rather than get very explicit about every single detail, I
wanted to start out with a vague description of what I was aiming for. I did
want to encourage it to try and build a Python repository how I normally
would, so I pointed it at <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OldNews</a> in the
hope that it might go and comprehend how I go about things; I also
doubled-down in the importance of using <code>uv</code> and <code>mypy</code>.</p>
<p>The result of this was... <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actually
impressive</a>. As you'll see in that
PR, to get to a point where it could be merged, there was some
back-and-forth with Copilot to add things I hadn't thought of initially, and
to get it to iron out some problems, but for the most part it delivered what
I was after. Without question it delivered it faster than I would have.</p>
<p>Some early issues where I had to point out problems to Copilot included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of posts on the home page wasn't obvious to me, and absolutely
  wasn't reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Footnotes were showing up kinda odd.</li>
<li>The main index for the blog was showing just posts titles, not the full
  text of the article as you'd normally expect from a blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing terrible, and it did get a lot of the heavy lifting done and done
well, but it was worth noting that a lot of dev-testing/QA needed to be done
to be confident about its work, and doing this picked up on little details
that are important.</p>
<h3 id="an-improvement-to-the-markdown">An improvement to the Markdown</h3>
<p>As an aside: during this first PR, I quickly noticed a problem where <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904192942" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was
getting this error when generating the site from the
Markdown</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Error generating site: mapping values are not allowed in this context
  in &quot;&lt;unicode string&gt;&quot;, line 3, column 15
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just assumed it was some bug in the generated code and left Copilot to
work it out. Instead it came back and educated me on something: <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904197313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I actually
had bad YAML in the frontmatter of some of my
posts</a>!</p>
<p>This, by the way, wouldn't be the last time that Copilot found an issue with
my input Markdown and so, having used it, improved my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-major-feature-from-a-simple-request">A major feature from a simple request</h3>
<p>Another problem I ran into quickly was that previewing the generated site
wasn't working well at all; all I could do was browse the files in the
filesystem. So, almost as an offhand comment, in the initial PR, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1#issuecomment-3904205550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I
asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we get a serve mode please so I can locally test the site?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like that, it went off <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/1/changes/3449eec9b4df88e66eec0f6bba4369926ff1389e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and wrote a whole server for the
project</a>.
While the server did need a lot of extra work to really work well<sup id="fnref:127-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-1">1</a></sup>, the
initial version was good enough to get me going and to iterate on the
project as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-workflow">The main workflow</h2>
<p>Having kicked off the project and having had some success with getting
Copilot to deliver what I was asking for, I settled into a new but also
familiar workflow. Whereas normally, when working on a personal project,
I'll write an issue for myself, at some point pick it up and create a PR,
review and test the PR myself then merge, now the workflow turned into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an issue but do so in a way that when I assign it to Copilot it has
  enough information to go off and do the work.</li>
<li>Wait for Copilot to get done.</li>
<li>Review the PR, making change requests etc.</li>
<li>Make any fixes that are easier for me to fix by hand that describe to
  Copilot.</li>
<li>Merge.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the first step had some sub-steps to it too, I was finding. What I
was doing, more than ever, was writing issues like I'd write sticky notes:
with simple descriptions of a bug or a new feature. I'd then come back to
them later and flesh them out into something that would act as a prompt for
Copilot. I found myself doing this so often I ended up adding a "Needs
prompt" label to my <a href="https://github.com/davep/setup-standard-labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usual set of issue
labels</a>.</p>
<p>All of this made for an efficient workflow, and one where I could often get
on with something else as Copilot worked on the latest job (I wasn't just
working on other things on my computer; sometimes I'd be going off and doing
things around the house while this happened), but... it wasn't fun. It was
the opposite of what I've always enjoyed when it comes to building software.
I got to dream up the ideas, I got to do the testing, I got to review the
quality of the work, but I didn't get to actually lose myself in the flow
state of coding.</p>
<p>One thing I've really come to understand during those 5 days of working on
BlogMore was I <em>really</em> missed getting lost in the flow state. Perhaps it's
the issue to PR to review to merge cycle I used that amplified this, perhaps
those who converse with an agent in their IDE or in some client application
keep a sense of that (I might have to try that approach out), but this feels
like a serious loss to me when it comes to writing code for personal
enjoyment.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-problems">The main problems</h2>
<p>I think it's fair to say that I've been surprised at just how well Copilot
understood my (sometimes deliberately vague) requests, at how it generally
managed to take some simple plain English and turn it into actual code that
actually did what I wanted and, mostly, actually worked.</p>
<p>But my experiences over the past few days haven't been without their
problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-confidently-wrong-problem">The confidently wrong problem</h3>
<p>Hopefully we all recognise that, with time and experience, we learn where
the mistakes are likely to turn up. Once you've written enough code you've
also written plenty of bugs and been caught out by plenty of edge-cases that
you get a spidey-sense for trouble as you write code. I feel that this kind
of approach can be called cautiously confident.</p>
<p>Working with Copilot<sup id="fnref:127-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-2">2</a></sup>, however, I often ran into the confidently wrong
issue. On occasion I found it would proudly<sup id="fnref:127-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-3">3</a></sup> request review for some
minor bit of work, proclaiming that it had done the thing or solved the
problem, and I'd test it and nothing had materially changed. On a couple of
occasions, when I pushed back, I found it actually doubting my review before
finally digging in harder and eventually solving the issue.</p>
<p>I found that this took time and was rather tiring.</p>
<p>There were also times where it would do the same but not directly in respect
to code. One example I can think of is when it was confident that Python
3.14 was still a pre-release Python as of February 2026 (<a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it
isn't</a>).</p>
<p>This problem alone concerns me; this is the sort of thing where people
without a good sense for when the agent is probably bullshitting will get
into serious trouble.</p>
<h3 id="the-tries-too-hard-problem">The tries-too-hard problem</h3>
<p>A variation on the above problem works the other way: on at least one
occasion I found that Copilot tried too hard to fix a problem that wasn't
really its to fix.</p>
<p>In this case <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was asking it to tidy up some validation issues in the RSS
feed data</a>. One of the main
problems was root-relative URLs being in the content of the feed; for that
they needed to be made absolute URLs. Copilot did an excellent job of fixing
the problem, but one (and from what I could see only one) relative URL
remained.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/110#issuecomment-3928257463" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked it to take a
look</a>
and it took a real age to work over the issue. To its credit, it dug hard
and it dug deep and it got to the bottom of the problem. The issue here
though was it tried too hard because, having found the cause of the problem
(a typo in my original Markdown, which had always existed) it went right
ahead and built a workaround for this one specific broken link.</p>
<p>Now, while I'm a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Postel's
law</a>, this is taking
things a bit too far. If this was a real person I'd tasked with the job I
would have expected and encouraged them to come back to me with their
finding and say <em>"dude, the problem is in your input data"</em> and I'd have
fixed my original Markdown.</p>
<p>Here though it just went right ahead and added this one weird edge case as
something to handle.</p>
<p>I think this is something to be concerned about and to keep an eye on too. I
feel there's a danger in having the agent rabbit-hole a fix for a problem
that it should simply have reported back to me for further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="the-never-pushes-back-problem">The never-pushes-back problem</h3>
<p>Something I did find unsurprising but disconcerting was Copilot's
unwillingness to push back, or at least defend its choices. Sometimes it
would make a decision or a change and I'd simply ask it why it had done it
that way, why it had made that choice. Rather than reply with its reasoning
it would pretty much go <em>"yeah, my bad, let me do it a way you're probably
going to find more pleasing"</em>.</p>
<p>A simple example of this is one time when I saw some code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@property</span>
<span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">some_property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">SomeValue</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">blogmore.utils</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">some_utility_function</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm not a fan of imports in the body of methods <em>unless</em> there's a
demonstrable performance reason. I asked Copilot why it had made this choice
here and its reply was simply to say it had gone ahead and changed the code,
moving the import to the top of the module.</p>
<p>I see plenty of people talk about how working with an agent is like
pair-programming, but I think it misses out on what's got to be the biggest
positive of that approach: the debate and exchange of ideas. This again
feels like a concern to be mindful of, especially if someone less
experienced is bringing code to you where they've used an agent as their
pair buddy.</p>
<h2 id="the-overall-impression">The overall impression</h2>
<p>Now I'm at the end of the process, and using the result of this experiment
to write this post<sup id="fnref:127-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:127-4">4</a></sup>, I feel better informed about what these tools offer,
and the pitfalls I need to be mindful of. Sometimes it wasn't a terrible way
of working. For example, on the first day I started with this, at one point
on a chilly but sunny Sunday afternoon, I was sat on the sofa, MacBook on
lap, guiding an AI to write code, while petting the cat, watching the birds
in the garden enjoy the content of the feeder, all while chatting with my
partner.</p>
<p>That's not a terrible way to write code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as I said earlier, I missed the flow state. I <em>love</em>
getting lost in code for a few hours and this is not that. I also found the
constant loop of prompt, wait, review, test, repeat, really quite
exhausting.</p>
<p>As best as I can describe it: it feels like the fast food of software
development. It gets the job done, it gets it done fast, but it's really not
fulfilling.</p>
<p>At the end of the process I have a really useful tool, 100% "built with AI",
under my guidance, which lets me <em>actually</em> be creative and build things I
do create by hand. That's not a bad thing, I can see why this is appealing
to people. On the other hand the process of building that tool was pretty
boring and, for want of a better word... soulless.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I write this I have about 24 hours of access to GitHub Copilot Pro left.
It seems this experiment used up my preview time and triggered a <em>"looks
like you're having fun, now you need to decide if you want to buy it"</em>
response. That's fair.</p>
<p>So now I'm left trying to decide if I want to pay to keep it going. At the
level I've been using it at for building BlogMore it looks like it costs
$10/mth. That actually isn't terrible. I spend more than that on other
hobbies and other forms of entertainment. So, if I can work within the
bounds of that tier, it's affordable and probably worth it.</p>
<p>What I'm not sure about yet is if I want to. It's been educational, I can
100% see how and where I'd use this for work (and would of course expect an
employer to foot the bill for it or a similar tool), and I can also see how
and where I might use it to quickly build a personal-use tool to enable
something more human-creative.</p>
<p>Ultimately though I think I'm a little better informed thanks to this
process, and better aware of some of the wins people claim, and also better
informed so that I can be rightly incredulous when faced with some of the
wilder claims.</p>
<p>Also, it'll help put <a href="https://raindrop.io/davep/public-46742255/search/sort=-created&amp;perpage=30&amp;page=0&amp;search=%23AI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of my

            <p>For <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">about 2 and a half years
now</a> this blog has been built
with <a href="https://getpelican.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pelican</a>. For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).</p>
<p>There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.</p>
<p>Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.</p>
<p>The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.</p>
<p>The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
<a href="https://blogmore.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlogMore</a>; a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.</p>
<p>At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, <a href="https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I'd
love to hear about
it</a>.</p>
<p>As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... that's a blog post to come.</p>
<p>I took lots of notes.</p>

<p>I honestly can't remember when I was first introduced to the idea of
RSS/Atom feeds, and the idea of having an aggregator or reader of some
description to keep up with updates on your favourite sites. It's got to be
over 25 years ago now. I can't remember what I used either, but I remember
using one or two readers that ran locally, right up until I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google
Reader</a>. Once I discovered that
I was settled.</p>
<p>As time moved on and I moved from platform to platform, and wandered into
the smartphone era, I stuck with Google Reader (and the odd client for it
here and there). It was a natural and sensible approach to consuming news
and updates. It also mostly felt like a solved problem and so felt nice and
stable.</p>
<p>So, of course, I was annoyed when Google killed it off, <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like so many useful
things</a>.</p>
<p>When this happened I dabbled with a couple of alternatives and, at some
point, finally settled on <a href="https://theoldreader.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TheOldReader</a>. Since
then it's been my "server" for feed subscriptions with me using desktop and
mobile clients to work against it.</p>
<p>But... I never found anything that worked for me that ran in the terminal.
Given <a href="/tag/terminal.html">I've got a thing for writing terminal-based
tools</a> it made sense I should have a go, and so
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OldNews</a> became my winter break project.</p>
<p><img alt="Reading an article in OldNews" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/reading.png" /></p>
<p>I've written it as a client application for <a href="https://github.com/theoldreader/api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the API of
TheOldReader</a>, and only for that, and
have developed it in a way that works well for me. All the functionality I
want and need is in there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add subscriptions</li>
<li>Rename subscriptions</li>
<li>Remove subscriptions</li>
<li>Add folders</li>
<li>Rename folders</li>
<li>Remove folders</li>
<li>Move subscriptions between folders</li>
<li>Mark read/unread</li>
<li>Read articles (that provide actual content in their feeds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently there's no support for starring feeds or interacting with the
whole "friend" system (honestly: while I see mention of it in the API, I
know nothing of that side of things and really don't care about it). As time
goes on I might work on that.</p>
<p>As with all of my other terminal-based applications, there's a rich command
palette that shows you what you can do, and also what keyboard shortcuts
will run those commands. While I do still need to work on some documentation
for the application (although you'd hope that anyone looking for an RSS
reader at this point would mostly be able to find their way around) the
palette is a good place to go looking for things you can do.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/command-palette.png" /></p>
<p>Plus there's a help screen too.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2026/02/11/help.png" /></p>
<p>If themes are your thing, there's themes:</p>

<p>OldNews has been a daily-driver for a wee while now, while also under active
development. I think I've covered all the main functions I want and have
also shaken out plenty of bugs, so today's the day to call it v1.0.0 and go
from there.</p>
<p>If you're a user of TheOldReader and fancy interacting with it from the
terminal too then it's out there to try out. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oldnews/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">via
PyPI</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and running with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oldnews
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed using
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>uv<span class="w"> </span>tool<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oldnews
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you don't have <code>uv</code> installed you can use <a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uvx.sh</a> to
perform the installation. For GNU/Linux or macOS or similar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>-LsSf<span class="w"> </span>uvx.sh/oldnews/install.sh<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>or on Windows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>powershell<span class="w"> </span>-ExecutionPolicy<span class="w"> </span>ByPass<span class="w"> </span>-c<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;irm https://uvx.sh/oldnews/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once installed, run the <code>oldnews</code> command.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is useful to someone else; meanwhile I'll be using it more
and more. If you need help, or have any ideas, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/davep/oldnews/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise an

<p><img alt="A chiral crystal" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/chiral.jpeg#centre" /></p>
<p>Death Stranding, along with its sequel, is my absolute favourite video game
ever, and probably one of my favourite pieces of fiction ever too; I've
watched and read a lot about the game (not to mention I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORDJd_VYhF74e6Mapf8oHp8i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">played both
releases a ton
too</a>).
A good few months back I was watching <a href="https://youtu.be/_GhSXMMJp0E?si=dGxAJlgLi5BBKCkM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video about the making of the first
game</a> and during the
video, <a href="https://youtu.be/_GhSXMMJp0E?si=z6FKH_FNfFMEozAe&amp;t=1635" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around the 27:20
mark</a>, the narrator
says the phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the game's core values of solidarity, empathy, and patience</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stood out to me. There was something about that phrase and what it
meant given my experiences in Death Stranding and Death Stranding 2; it
spoke to me enough that I jotted it down and kept coming back to it and
thinking about it. It was a phrase I couldn't get out of my head.</p>
<p>Around the same time I was also doing a lot of thinking about, and
note-writing about, code reviews. Although I've been working in software
development<sup id="fnref:198-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:198-1">1</a></sup> for a few decades now (I started in July 1989), I was quite
late to the whole process of code review -- at least in the way we talk
about it today. This mostly comes down to the fact that for a lot of my time
I either worked in very small companies or I was the only developer around.</p>
<p>Given this, thinking about my own approach to reviews is something I've only
really been doing for the past few years. I've made personal notes about it,
read posts and articles about it, I've had conversations about it; my
thoughts and feelings about it have drifted a little but seem to have
settled.</p>
<p>The idea of that phrase from the Death Stranding video crept into this
thought process, as I felt it nicely summed up what a good code review would
look and feel like. Weirdly I also realised that, perhaps, the things I like
and value about Death Stranding are also the things I like, value, and want
to embody when it comes to code reviews.</p>
<p>One of the big selling points for me, with Death Stranding, is the
asynchronous multiplayer aspect of it; the reason Kojima calls it a "Strand
type game". I have my game, I have my goal, but other people can indirectly
affect it, either doing work in their game that leaks into mine in a
beneficial way, or by leaking into mine in a way that I have to clean up.
There's something really satisfying about this asynchronous collaboration.
That feels similar to the collective effort of working in a single
repository, each person working on their own branch or PR, sometimes in
tandem, sometimes in series, sometimes to the benefit of each other and
sometimes in ways that block each other.</p>
<p>But that's not the point here. There's a similarity if I think about it, but
I don't want to get too carried away on that line of thought. It's the
phrase from the video I care about; it's the approach of involving
solidarity, empathy and patience I want to think about more.</p>
<h2 id="solidarity">Solidarity</h2>
<p><img alt="In the mountains" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/mountains.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This, for me, is all about where you position yourself when you approach
reviewing code. I sense things only work well if you view the codebase as
something with common ownership. I've worked on and with a codebase where
the original author invited others in to collaborate, but where they
constantly acted as a gatekeeper, and often as a gatekeeper who was
resistant to their own contributions being reviewed, and it was an
exhausting experience.</p>
<p>I believe the key here is to work against a "your code" vs "my standard"
approach, instead concentrating on an "our repository" view. That's not to
say that there shouldn't be standards and that they shouldn't be maintained
-- there should be and they should be -- but more to say that they should be
agreed upon, mutually understood to be worthwhile, and that any callout of a
standard not being applied is seen as a good and helpful thing.</p>
<p>The driving force here should be the shared intent, and how the different
degrees of knowledge and experience can come together to express that
intent. If a reviewer can see issues with a submission, with a proposed
change or addition to the codebase, the ideal approach is to highlight them
in such a way as to make it feel like <em>we</em> discovered them, not that <em>I</em>
discovered them and <em>you</em> should sort it out. Depending on the degree of
proposed change, this might actually be expressed by (if you're using
GitHub, for example) using the "Suggested Change" feature to directly feed
back into the PR, or perhaps for something a little more complex, or the
offer to pair up to work on the solution.</p>
<h2 id="empathy">Empathy</h2>
<p><img alt="Sam and Fragile" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/Sam-and-Fragile.jpeg" /></p>
<p>As someone who has written a lot of code, and so written a lot of bugs and
made a lot of bad design choices, I feel empathy is the easiest of the three
words to get behind and understand, but possibly the hardest one to actually
put into practice.</p>
<p>When you look at a PR, it's easy to see code, to see those design choices,
and to approach the reading as if you were the one who had written it,
assessing it through that lens. In my own experience, this is where I find
myself writing and re-writing my comments during a review. As much as
possible I try and ask the author <em>why</em> they've taken a particular approach.
It could be, perhaps, that I've simply missed a different perspective they
have. If that's the case I'll learn something about the code (and about
them); if that isn't the case I've invited them to have a second read of
their contribution. It seems to me that this benefits everyone.</p>
<p>I feel that where I land with this is the idea of striving to act less like
a critic and more like a collaborator, and in doing so aiming to add to an
atmosphere of psychological safety. Nobody should feel like there's a
penalty to getting something "wrong" in a contribution; they should ideally
feel like they've learnt a new "gotcha" to be mindful of in the future (both
as an author and a reviewer). Done right the whole team, and the work,
benefits.</p>
<h2 id="patience">Patience</h2>
<p><img alt="Arriving at the plate gate" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/Plate-Gate.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The patience aspect of this view of reviews, for me, covers a few things.
There's the patience that should be applied when reading over the code;
there's the patience that should be applied when walking someone through
feedback and suggestions; and there's the patience needed by the whole team
to not treat code reviews as a speed bump on the road to getting work over
the line. While patience applies to other facets of a review too, I think
these are the most important parts.</p>
<p>In a work environment I think it's the last point -- that of the team's
collective patience -- that is the most difficult to embody and protect.
Often we'll find ourselves in a wider environment that employs a myopic view
of progress and <em>getting things done</em>, where the burn-down chart for the
sprint is all that matters. In that sort of environment a code review can
often be seen, by some, as a frustrating hurdle to moving that little card
across that board. Cards over quality. Cards over sustainability.</p>
<p>It's my belief that this is one of those times where the phrase "slow down
to speed up" really does apply. For me, review time is where the team gets
to grow, to own the project, to own the code, to really apply the
development and engineering principles they want to embody. Time spent on a
review now will, in my experience, collectively save a lot more time later
on, as the team becomes more cohesive and increasingly employs a shared
intuition for what's right for the project.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-entirely-a-post-about-code-reviews">This is not (entirely) a post about code reviews</h2>
<p><img alt="Near the wind farm" src="/attachments/2026/02/04/Wind-Farm.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The thing with code reviews, or any other team activities, is they don't
exist in a vacuum. They take on the taste and smell of the culture in which
they operate. It's my experience that it doesn't matter how much solidarity,
empathy or patience you display during your day-to-day, if it's counter to
the culture in which you work it's always going to be exhausting, it's
always going to feel like a slog.</p>
<p>If leadership in technology, in software engineering, were to show more of
these three basic qualities, they'd start to appear like they realise that
they're working with actual humans, not producers of code; and I think we
need more of that now than at any time in the history of coding.</p>
<p>Since I first saw that video, and heard that phrase, and had it run around
my head, I've come to feel that it's not just a good mantra for code
reviews; I think it's a simple blueprint for what good tech leadership
should look like. If there was more "Strand-type" leadership in my chosen
industry I feel it would be more open, more accessible, would offer more
psychological safety and ultimately would result in teams, and projects,
that thrive.</p>

            <p>In the past few months, like a lot of folk in the Python world, I've been
won over by <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>uv</code></a>. When it comes to managing my
own projects my journey over the past few years as been
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>pipenv</code></a>, then
<a href="https://rye.astral.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>rye</code></a>, and then when rye was killed off I finally
swapped to <code>uv</code> (later than I should have, I realised in hindsight). At each
step I've found each tool cleaner, easier to work with and more
feature-rich.</p>
<p>There's no doubt in my mind that <code>uv</code> has done the most work to make
installing Python-based tools (or at least PyPI-based tools) <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as
friction-free an experience as
possible</a>.</p>
<p>Now I've discovered <a href="https://uvx.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uvx.sh</a>. The thing with <code>uv</code> is the
person installing your application first needs to get and install <code>uv</code>; this
site removes that friction. Now if someone wants to install
<a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> (for example) they should be able to
just do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class="w"> </span>-LsSf<span class="w"> </span>uvx.sh/obs2nlm/install.sh<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>and away they go (assuming they have <a href="https://curl.se" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">curl</a> installed,
which is generally going to be far more likely than having <code>uv</code> installed).</p>
<p>Of course, there are <a href="https://www.djm.org.uk/posts/protect-yourself-from-non-obvious-dangers-curl-url-pipe-sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the usual caveats and
concerns</a>
about the <em>"just pipe this stuff via <code>sh</code> trust me bro"</em> approach, but if
you are comfortable with suggesting this kind of install method it looks
worth adding this to an application's installation documentation.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to start mentioning it as an option.</p>

            <p>After having knocked up <a href="/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html">obs2nlm the other day</a> I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: <a href="/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html">one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection</a>!</p>
<p>And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as <code>obs2nlm</code>, only it
uses <a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ngdb</code></a> to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be working a treat.</p>
<p><img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre" /></p>
<p>Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.</p>
<p>I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a <em>long</em>
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I <em>think</em> this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What are all the numbers in square brackets for?</p>
<p><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source <em>and linking to it</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre" /></p>
<p>so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.</p>
<p>If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:</p>
<p><img alt="No citations in the code" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre" /></p>
<p>So, given this, perhaps I can use the
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>--additional-instructions</code></a>
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak <code>ng2nlm</code> itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> exists.</p>

a place to go back and look things up.</p>

things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/vault2source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few months
ago</a>, had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> was born.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.</p>
<p>So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I <em>know</em> the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.</p>
<p>Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
<a href="/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html">I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things</a> and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in <a href="https://journey.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Journey</a> for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in <a href="https://evernote.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evernote</a>,
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Textualize</a>. It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obs2nlm</a> will be handy for you.</p>
