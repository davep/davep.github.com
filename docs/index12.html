      <div><p>It's Tuesday morning. That means it's the day after
<a href="/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html">Virgin said they'd call me back to deal with the refund issue from last Friday</a>.
I've not had a call back. That's the second time now I've been told they'll
call me back on a specific date and I've had nothing.</p>
<p>Right now I'm missing a callback about the refund <em>and</em> some sort of update
on the ticket wallet issue (which was promised "very soon"
<a href="/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html">back on July 15th</a>).</p>
<p>I'm also waiting for some sort of contact from another party in the
organisation that I was promised via DM on twitter last Friday. No sign of
that either (although no timescale was given for that).</p>
<p>It's starting to get a little tedious, always having to be the one to chase
things up.</p>
<p>But chase them up I will...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Given it's been a couple of weeks, I thought I'd write a little update on
the fun and games with Virgin East Coast. I'll also add another little
"problem" into the mix in this post -- something that has been happening in
the background and didn't seem to be an issue to start with.</p>
<p>As <a href="/2016/07/14/virgin_east_coast_8.html">mentioned a couple of weeks back</a>,
I dropped them a line to chase things up (pointing out that the scheduled
callback was long overdue) and got this reply on the 15th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your email reply and apologies that I did not call you on
the 11th I must have missed my Outlook reminder.</p>
<p>I have today again tried to call our second line support team to query
this again and see how far they are with this however they have not picked
up so I have emailed them once again.</p>
<p>Last time I spoke to them on the phone the person said that it should only
be a few more days so hopefully I will be emailing you again very soon
with some more substantial information on this for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I write this it's the 29th and I've had no update. I guess this is the
problem with phrases like "very soon" -- you're never quite sure if you
should read it to mean in the next couple of days, or if 14 days later still
falls within "very soon". Personally, if it was me, I'd be dropping a line
along the way to say "it's taking longer than I'd like, but I'm still on
it". You know, that thing of ensuring the customer doesn't feel like they've
been forgotten about.</p>
<p>So, very soon<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, I guess I'll be sending another follow-up email to try and
find out what's going on. I'll update when I do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile.... there's another issue that's brewing.</p>
<p>Back at the start of June I was on a train that was delayed by more than
half an hour. This is the first time this has happened to me since I've been
using the trains a lot and I was delighted to find that they make a point of
letting you know that
<a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/customer-service/delay-repay/">you're entitled to a refund on your ticket, depending on how late you are</a>.</p>
<p>That struck me as very sensible and very civilised.</p>
<p>So, when I finally got home, I put in my claim and on June 6th I got an
email confirming I was entitled to a 50% refund and that it would be sent as
a cheque to me within 28 days.</p>
<p>Of course, 28 days later, nothing had turned up. I called them shortly after
that to find out what was going on. They claimed the cheque had been sent
and suggested it had got lost on the way (in the 2 years I've been at this
address it's the first time I've knowingly had mail disappear). Anyway, they
cancelled that cheque and issued another, apologising for the hassle and
promising that the new one would be with me within a week.</p>
<p>As it was I wasn't around for a couple of weeks after that so I got home
yesterday, expecting to see the cheque on my doormat. I expected
incorrectly.</p>
<p>I've called them about it again today and was told the most interesting
story: apparently they can't help me right now because they've closed down a
call centre down in Plymouth (I think it was), which was "outsourced", and
they now no longer have access to the "computer system" with all the cases
in it. They assured me that they'd get access to it within the next week or
two.</p>
<p>Let that settle in for a moment: they apparently arranged to close down a
call centre without ensuring that the computer systems that contain (some
of?) their customers' data were handed over in some way, shape or form.</p>
<p>That's a touch worrying.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, I wasn't terribly pleased by this news. I'm a couple
of months on from when the delay happened and I <em>still</em> don't have the
cheque. On top of that, not having received the second attempt at sending
it, I find out that nothing was likely being done about it because they'd
(apparently) dropped the staff/company who would have been dealing with it.
And I had to phone them (again) to find out.</p>
<p>I imagine that if I'd just left it to them to get in contact and let me
know, I'd have waited and waited and never got anything at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, after pointing out that it was a bit much to ask
me to let them hold onto my money even longer, just because of their system
and business issues, I was passed to someone else who was able to suggest a
far better and far quicker method of resolving this.</p>
<p>So: I'm expecting a call back from them on Monday to get that process under
way. I wonder if <em>this</em> callback will happen?</p>

      <div><p>Little update on the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app saga. After
<a href="/2016/07/06/virgin_east_coast_6.html">my previous reply to them</a> I got a
reply back yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr Pearson</p>
<p>Many thanks for your email dated 6th July 2016 regarding the fact that you
cannot sign into your Virgin Trains ticket wallet app after registering on
the desktop version of our website with the email address
davep.org+virgin@gmail.com.</p>
<p>I firstly apologise for the lack of understanding on the part of our
Virgin Trains East Coast Web Support team with regards to this, the Mobile
ticket issue on our app that you have described is one that has not
occurred very frequently at all for any of our customers and as such this
is what is causing the difficulty in resolving this for you.</p>
<p>I have today spoken to our second line support team and asked them the
question of if there is soon to be a fix for this for you to which they
have stated that they need a few more days to get this fixed.</p>
<p>I will schedule in a contact back for you for Monday 11th July and after
chasing them about this again I will contact you to let you know what is
happening with this now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it's taken quite a while, it looks like I'm finally making some
progress. If I'm reading it right they finally acknowledge that there is a
problem and that it needs fixing. It's frustrating that I've had to go
backwards and forwards a few times to get to this point.</p>
<p>Monday will be interesting.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's been over a week now
<a href="/2016/06/28/virgin_east_coast_5.html">since I last had contact with customer services</a>
and there's still been no word. So, earlier today, I sent off an email.
Short and sweet, requesting that I possibly get an answer to the questions
I'd asked them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, it's over a week now since I answered the couple of questions you
asked and asked a couple of my own. Is it possible to get a reply and an
update on what's happening?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in the day I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Dave</p>
<p>Thank you for your email dated 6th June 2016 concerning the tickets that
you have not booked with us yet and the fact that your Mobile App ticket
wallet is not able to show you anything after you have installed it.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that there has been a mix up with the confirming to you
if your email address has been registered or not and a such I wish to
clarify this for you, also that there has been such a delay in responding
to you.</p>
<p>I can now confirm that your email address davep.org+virgin@gmail.com is
registered on our website and that you have signed up for our Ticket
wallet app successfully. We apologise for telling you that it was not but
this could well have been that we were searching your email address that
you have been emailing us from and this is what has caused the confusion.</p>
<p>With regards to the use of our Ticket Wallet app before you have made a
booking with us either on that or on our desktop site, it is believed that
you will not be able to see much at all within the app before you make a
booking with us however we have made the raise about this for you and we
chased this up on the 27th June when you emailed us previously.</p>
<p>I will chase this up again however if possible please confirm what page
you get to in the ticket wallet app at the moment so that we can identify
if this is normal for a customer has no booking allocated to the app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I'm starting to seriously consider the idea that I'm being
trolled. To start with, there's this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>concerning the tickets that you have not booked with us yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard not to read that as sarcasm. Any way I look at it it comes across
as sarcasm. Sure, of course I've not booked any tickets direct with them
(although I have booked lots of tickets with them this year via other
websites) because of the issue -- that's the damn issue!</p>
<p>Anyway, possible over-sensitivity on my part aside...</p>
<p>The reply <em>still</em> seems to think that the problem is that I'm not seeing
tickets I've not booked inside the Ticket Wallet app. That isn't the
problem. The problem, as I clearly stated from the very start, is that I
can't even log into the app. I. CAN'T. LOG. IN!</p>
<p>I've said this plenty of times. I've made it very clear that this is the
problem. And still I'm being asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>please confirm what page you get to in the ticket wallet app</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm really wondering what part of "I can't even log into the app" is so hard
to understand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at least I've now got my second confirmation of the fact
that I do actually have an account on their website, after being told I
don't. I suppose that's something.</p>
<p>Meanwhile.... the Ticket Wallet app is
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html"><em>still</em></a> telling me that my user name
or password are incorrect.</p>
<p>PS: "Thank you for your email dated 6th June 2016" -- it's July, not June.</p></div>

      <div><p>Quick update on where things are at with the attempt to get help with the
apparent inability to log into the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app using
an otherwise perfectly valid account...</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="/2016/06/27/virgin_east_coast_4.html">yesterday</a> I had an
email from them. I replied (after writing yesterday's blog post):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm very concerned and very confused by your question about if I've even
registered with the main website. Yes, I have. I've confirmed this more
than once now. During my first phone conversation with support I was told
I wasn't in the system and then, when I demonstrated that I had to be, I
was magically "found" after some magic "fix" was applied on the fly. Now
I'm being told I don't exist again.</p>
<p>I seem to be going backwards with this rather than going forwards, and
what's even more frustrating is that any question I ask seems to get
ignored while I keep being asked the same basic questions time and again.</p>
<p>Yes, I did register with the main website. That's how I found there was an
Android app that works with it. That's how I followed the link to
it. That's how I found the support report form and managed to drop you a
line in the first place.</p>
<p>So, just so I'm 100% clear on this: which email address are you looking
for? How are you looking for it? Where are you looking for it? How come
someone looked for it before, didn't find it, and then found it when
looking again? If I'm not in the system how is it possible for me to log
into the main website?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also added a couple of screenshots, with explanation, that shows me
logging in with the address they claim doesn't exist in their system.</p>
<p>I've had no reply to my questions so far. I've had no reply at all so far.</p>
<p>After posting yesterday's post I did the usual thing of tweeting it and,
obviously, mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a>
in the tweet.</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good 10 days into the <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> support saga and there’s no end in sight: <a href="https://t.co/ZfV0lR4DQL">https://t.co/ZfV0lR4DQL</a></p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/747362449876197377">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>This lead to a little exchange on twitter where I mentioned that the main
reason I was trying to switch to Virgin's own system, rather than use
someone line TheTrainLine, was so that I could get the free WiFi and save
myself a tenner each trip.</p>
<p>All credit to Virgin East Coast: they contacted me directly and have
provided me with 10 one-use WiFi access codes to keep me going while this
gets sorted out. It's not a solution to the problem, but it does remove the
extra cost I was trying to get rid of for the next 5 standard class round
trips (I sometimes sneak in a first class journey if the price is too good
to ignore).</p>
<p>So.... no still no solution, but some welcome help from them to be going on
with. Can't grumble at that.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday, realising
<a href="/2016/06/20/virgin_east_coast_3.html">it had been a week since I'd last had any contact with Virgin East Coast support</a>,
I dropped them a line to find out what was going on. Given that they'd
generally been pretty quick to reply and deal with things initially (albeit
in ways that didn't really seem to fix the problem) it seemed odd that
they'd gone so quiet.</p>
<p>I've had a reply this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Dave</p>
<p>Thank you for your email chaser today with regards to the Mobile app that
you registered on and now cannot sign into it to test the device before
you book.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that you have not been in receipt of a reply with
regards to this and as such I will try and solve this for you now.</p>
<p>We did not receive anything back from our second line support team and as
such we may need to do more troubleshooting before we chase this with
them.</p>
<p>Please can you confirm if you have actually registered on the desktop
version of our web site please?</p>
<p>I know that you stated that you have signed up for the mobile app and
registered on this but your email address does not show on our system as
being registered so we just want to ensure that we have explored all
areas.</p>
<p>Once we have this from you we can then add this to the valuable
information that you have already provided and chase this up for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, this is starting to get silly now. I don't mind so much that
they've been slow in getting back to me on the problem because they've been
waiting on "second line support" to get back to them, but that doesn't seem
to really make sense in the light of them saying afterwards that my email
address doesn't even show in their system.</p>
<p>Really, if they can "see" that I'm not even registered in their system, why
would they have passed things to "second line support"? That makes no sense.</p>
<p>But, actually, it gets even worse. During
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">my original phone conversion with them</a>
the lady I spoke to made the exact same claim. She told me that my email
address wasn't even in the system, hadn't been registered via the
website. Of course it had (I even sent the initial message for support from
their website, while logged in). I pointed this out and she went off to look
into it; she came back to say it was there now. When I asked what had
happened she mumbled something about how there'd been a problem and she'd
got someone to fix it.</p>
<p>No, I have no exact details about it, but quite simply she said I wasn't in
the system, I provided her good evidence I was and then she made "magic"
happen and suddenly I was visible.</p>
<p>But, now, apparently, I'm not visible again.</p>
<p>Either someone at Virgin East Coast is fibbing to me, or their system has a
bad habit of losing people's details. It's not like I'm so stupid to think
I've registered but actually haven't. I can log into the website with the
details I registered with. I've had a member of staff confirm I'm in the
system. I've had subsequent support chats take place where the person I'm
dealing with is satisfied that I exist in the system. I even had them ask me
to try and reset my password -- something I imagine isn't possible if you've
not even registered with the system yet!</p>
<p>This is getting really silly now. This is possibly getting beyond silly.</p>
<p>The serious side of this is, of course, I can't trust the Virgin East Coast
website or their booking system, so I have to continue using a third party,
which means Virgin still get to grab an extra tenner off me on every trip so
I can have WiFi and get some work done.</p></div>

      <div><p>Another update to the saga of trying to get the Virgin East Coast Ticket
Wallet app up and running.</p>
<p>Late on yesterday afternoon (a Sunday, it has to be said, so that's some
dedication to solving the problem) I got a reply to
<a href="http://blog.davep.org/2016/06/18/virgin_east_coast_2.html">the email I'd sent them previously</a>. It
didn't contain anything in response to what I'd written (so it looks like
I'm never going to find out what a TOC is! <em>sadface</em>) but it did say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Dave Pearson,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>Please attempt to change your password via the ‘forgotten password’
process.</p>
<p>Once you have amended your password, please attempt to sign into your
Virgin Trains East Coast Ticket Wallet App.</p>
<p>I apologise for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll admit that I wasn't convinced by this plan. There was no explanation as
to why I'd want to change my password, or why I'd want to pretend that I'd
forgotten my password (I hadn't forgotten it, obviously), there wasn't a
suggestion that something had been changed or fixed such that this would
tickle a solution into working. It appeared to imply that I'd actually
forgotten my password and that I should go about setting it again.</p>
<p>Fair enough... I did. It didn't make a jot of difference. Same problem. I've
written back to say so.</p>
<p>The actual act of saying I'd forgotten my password was a little odd. I did
the obvious thing of going to the
<a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/">main website</a> and saying I wanted
to sign in.</p>
<p><img alt="Sign in on main site" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.28.31.png"></p>
<p>Once clicked, that took me to the actual login page, which has the link to
say you've forgotten your password.</p>
<p><img alt="Link to reset password" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.29.07.png"></p>
<p>When you click on that link you get taken to.... a login page!</p>
<p><img alt="Another login page" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.29.28.png"></p>
<p>There you then have to say, again, that you've forgotten your password. Only
once you've done that do you get somewhere where you can say you've actually
forgotten your password.</p>
<p><img alt="Finally I can reset" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.29.42.png"></p>
<p>Not horrific, of course, but a rather odd route, needing to click pretty
much the same link twice to say the same thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried it, it didn't work, they've had an email to say as much. Now
I wait for the next step.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This morning I called back on
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">the number I'd been given yesterday evening</a>. I
explained briefly why I was calling and how I was returning someone's call
but, sadly, ended up back in support script-following hell: they started
asking for booking reference and all that stuff again. I stopped them,
explained the issue <em>again</em>, and they then started to ask for ticket details
and so on.</p>
<p>Deeply frustrating. The problem I had was that I was trying to set
everything up so I could even stand a chance of booking a ticket. How could
I have a ticket I could tell them about if I'd not even got to that part?</p>
<p>When I made this clear, in as polite but firm way as possible, I was passed
onto that person's supervisor.</p>
<p>As luck would have it he was the person who'd called and left a message last
night. He quickly filled me in on what was happening, saying they weren't
sure what the problem was but that the details had been passed to the tech
people. He also asked if he could send me an email with some questions in it
that would help get to the bottom of things; he said it would ask things
like OS type and version, device type, etc. It all seemed to make sense</p>
<p>I said I'd be happy to and we left it at that.</p>
<p>I've had the email. This is what it asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Origin and Destination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gah! Here we go again. The whole support thing appears to be predicated on
the idea that you're having a problem getting somewhere. They seem to not
understand that if you can't even use the system in the first place you
can't even have booked a ticket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - Date and Time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a ticket, there can be no date and time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - Number of passengers and railcards if any</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing a pattern here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - Ticket name and price</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm... hello?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Browser name &amp; version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally! We're getting somewhere! Only... my problem isn't in a web
browser. My problem is with logging in with their Android app. I'm sure I
mentioned this to them at least once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 - Screenshot if possible showing the error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay! Finally! We're getting somewhere! I pasted in the screenshot that was
included in yesterday's blog post. You know the one. The one where it's just
some text that says the username and password are invalid. Because... images
are better than the text in them, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 -  Name of the TOC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no clue what this means. TOC? What the heck is a TOC?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8 - Email address of the user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This I can do! I know this one! (I still suspect that this is the cause of
the problem).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9 - Booking ref</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaaarrrrrggghhhhhh!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Screen shot showing exact error and exact steps to recreate the error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait... didn't I get asked that in question 6? How is this screenshot going
to be different from the other screenshot? Still, at least it asks for the
steps to recreate now. So I answered that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new account on the Virgin East Coast website. Ideally use an
   email address that contains both a full stop and a plus sign, as mine
   does. Also ensure that you use a password that is the same length as
   mine.</li>
<li>Log in and look at registered devices.</li>
<li>See there are none and follow the links it provides to the applicable app
   that will result in a device being registered. In this case the Ticket
   Wallet.</li>
<li>Download and install on a suitable Android device.</li>
<li>Attempt to log in and, likely, find that you're told that the username
   and password is incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
So that's all sent off now. Now I wait for another call back at some point
in the near future.</p>
<p>Curious how the thing it didn't ask was what app I was using, what version
it was, what mobile device it was being used on, what OS, what OS version,
etc...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This year has seen me travelling up and down the east coast of England (and
into Scotland) quite a bit. Unsurprisingly this means I've been using
<a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/">Virgin East Coast</a> a lot. While I'm
no stranger to the rail network (I grew up in York, my father worked for
what was once called British Rail, etc) I've not been a regular user since
the mid 1990s (when I used to travel from Winchester to London every day).</p>
<p>Much has changed since the last time I used the trains a lot; the big (good)
change being that you can do a ton of stuff online and, even more usefully,
you can do most things on your mobile phone. Being able to buy tickets from
my desk or sofa, and being able to carry all the useful info (times, seat
numbers, etc) inside an app makes for an almost stress-free journey.</p>
<p>Up until now I've being using <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">TheTrainLine</a>
to do all the booking. The website is uncluttered and easy to use. The same
is true of their Android app. I have no complaints at all about how their
system works.</p>
<p>But there is one small downside...</p>
<p>The journey I do takes about 4 hours so it makes sense that I settle down
and get some work done. Working, of course, requires that I have some sort
of Net connection. Ideally I'd just connect via my phone but I find that the
signal can't be relied on for large parts of the journey. But that's okay,
the trains have WiFi.</p>
<p>It's not cheap though. On Virgin, if you're not travelling first class
(something I do do if I can get the right sort of deal) you need to pay £10
to get enough WiFi time to last the trip. Not horrific, but over a few
journeys it adds up.</p>
<p>Recently though Virgin East Coast have been doing this thing where, if you
book direct via them, you get the WiFi for free. So, while I have no
complaints about TheTrainLine, it makes sense for me to book direct with
Virgin and hopefully save myself a tenner on the WiFi.</p>
<p>A couple or so weeks back I finally created an account with VEC. I did my
usual thing that I do and used a variation on my Gmail email address. You
know the sort of thing,
<a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html">make use of the fact that anything after the + in the address doesn't "count"</a>
but can be useful to filter things and keep track of who's selling on your
contact details.</p>
<p>So I registered as davep.org+virgin@gmail.com. The website accepted it
just fine.</p>
<p>The next job was to install their wallet app. According to the website this
lets you travel without even needing to faff around with printed tickets:
you can do it 100% with your phone (something TTL now do too, I believe). So
I downloaded the app, went to log in, and...</p>
<p><img alt="Login denied" src="/attachments/2016/06/17/Screenshot_20160617-152120.png"></p>
<p>I tried a few times, just to be sure that I wasn't being an idiot and
messing up but... nope, it just wasn't going to let me log in.</p>
<p>Dammit!</p>
<p>After a few more attempts I gave up and went back to using TTL. Yesterday,
however, I decided to look into this again. The problem persisted so I
logged into the VEC website, followed the links for getting help with the
site (I couldn't see help for the app) and sent a message using the form on
the website.</p>
<p>In the initial query I pointed out that I'd like to use the system to book
tickets -- especially so I could enjoy free WiFi -- but that the app
wouldn't let me log in. I asked how I might fix the problem.</p>
<p>The first reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please confirm which Mobile App you have downloaded and we will
advise you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, fair enough. I'd spoken about "the app" (although I'd only been
offered one via the site) and it seems there's more than one. So I wrote
back and confirmed I was talking about the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eastcoast.wallet">Ticket Wallet</a>.</p>
<p>They replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please provide us with your booking reference number and we will
advise you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm.... Hello? Booking reference? I smell a faint whiff of Catch-22
here.... Never mind. I write back and point out that there is no booking,
I'm asking about a problem with their app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please confirm if you have registered on the Virgin Trains East
Coast website and we will advise you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well this is getting fun. I'd been logged in and used their contact form
when I sought help. You'd think that it would record this information in
some way. Fair enough, perhaps not. So I confirm that, yes, I had created an
account with their website and was trying to use that to log in (I also
quoted a line from my original message where I'd said this, right from the
start).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have registered with us please provide us with the email address
used as the email address in the original email davep.org+virgin@gmail.com
is not recognised on our system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erm... Well this is getting silly now. That's absolutely the email address
I'd registered with and was logging in with. That's why I was trying to log
into the app with it! So I replied confirming that that was the address I'd
registered with and hence my confusion.</p>
<p>The reply? This:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can confirm Virgin Trains East Coast has two Mobile Application, the
Virgin Trains East Coast App and the Virgin Trains East Coast Live App.</p>
<p>When you purchase an eligible Virgin Trains East Coast ticket on the
website you will be offered the option of having your ticket delivered to
your mobile device as an m-ticket.</p>
<p>To use the app, simply sign in with your Virgin Trains East Coast login
details, and the app will synch with your online account. If you haven’t
registered that device before, it will ask you to name your device. That
name will then be shown in your account and when buying tickets, so you
can choose which device to send your tickets to.</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting the Virgin Trains East Coast web support team,
should you require any further assistance please don’t hesitate to contact
us on 03457 225 111.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm.... what? I'm still unsure what this was really telling me. The
words made sense, it seemed to be filled with facts, but none of this seemed
to pertain to what I was asking them. Worse still, it seemed to give the
impression that you needed to have purchased a ticket before you could
use the mobile app (at least that's one interpretation I'm getting from the
above) and yet, when you follow the links on the website, it says something
very different.</p>
<p>I replied pointing out that I was failing to see how that addressed what I'd
asked, and I reiterated my problem.</p>
<p>At this point I got a little frustrated and tweeted my frustration:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In support hell trying to log in with <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> Android app. Can’t imagine why it’s got this sort of rating. <a href="https://t.co/pSnuJiiUoB">pic.twitter.com/pSnuJiiUoB</a></p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/743800419361533952">June 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p></center></p>
<p>Which got this reply:</p>

<p></center></p>
<p>While I get that social media staff, more than any, can be overworked and
are often trying to put out all sorts of fires, this wasn't in any way
helpful to me. I pointed out what the actual issue was:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> The problem goes deeper than that.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>I'd also tweeted after my first, talking about the frustration of how TTL
seem to do things well, but I only get free WiFi if I book via Virgin:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What really bugs me: <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> offer free WiFi if book thru them, but app won’t work. <a href="https://twitter.com/thetrainline">@thetrainline</a> works brill, but no free Wifi.</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/743802438235328512">June 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>That tweet got a reply from them asking if I was talking about the wallet
app (I was, of course) and if I'd registered with the website first. O_o</p>
<p>So, after a lot of back and forth, I'd got nowhere with this. I did, a
little while later, get an email asking for my phone number so they could
call me; I replied with it.</p>
<p>The phone call came a little later on. It didn't go well.</p>
<p>At first I was told that the problem was that I needed to purchase a ticket
and then that would mean I'd be able to log into the mobile app. Let's just
take a moment to really appreciate what's being said: I SHOULD SPEND A
HUNDRED POUNDS OR MORE SO I CAN EVEN LOG INTO THE APP.</p>
<p>Only... that's
nonsense. <a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/rail-travel/your-ticket/m-tickets/">According to the website</a>
it works very different from that. What the website implies is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You create an account on the website.</li>
<li>You download the wallet app.</li>
<li>You log into the wallet app with the username and password you use on the
   website.</li>
<li>This then registers the mobile device with the system.</li>
<li>Then, and only then, can you buy a ticket.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I pointed this out to the nice lady on the other end of the line she
seemed confused by the idea and had to go and check it. She then came back
and confirmed that, yes, that's how it works. At which point I asked her how
I was supposed to actually log in if it kept telling me my username and
password were wrong.</p>
<p>She then suggested that, yes, perhaps there was a problem and could I send a
screenshot of the wallet app so they could look into it. A screenshot. O_o</p>
<p>Sure, I guess I could send in a screenshot. You can see it above. It's quite
simply the text "Your username or password is incorrect". That's it. That's
the problem. It's nice and easy to type. It's text. It's English. I can't
see any special pixels that would help debug the issue.</p>
<p>But, nope, it needed a screenshot.</p>
<p>I asked if, perhaps, I could speak with these "technical" people who'd be
dealing with this. I was told that that wouldn't be possible and that,
instead, she'd have her manager call me. She then hung up pretty sharpish
after that.</p>
<p>Right now, as of the time of writing, I'm waiting on that call.</p>
<p>While I do wait, I'm going to make a prediction as to the cause of this. I'm
willing to bet the problem is with the choice of email address. So many
large companies have systems that assume that + isn't a valid character for
an email address. I'm going to further guess that Virgin East Coast <em>isn't</em>
one of them when it comes to their website. When it comes to their Wallet
App though...</p>
<hr>
<p>Later in the evening: I never did get a call from the woman's manager, but
an hour or so later I did get a call from someone at their "web support
team". Sadly I wasn't in a position to take it so I'm no wiser as to what
the call was actually going to be about. I'll return the call tomorrow and,
all being well, write a second post about what happened.</p>
<p>The main thing I take away from this today though is that, if you (as
appears to have happened a few times today) follow a script and don't
<em>actually</em> read what the customer is writing, it's going to turn into a very
frustrating experience; especially for the customer.</p></div>
