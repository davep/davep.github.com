  <div>
      <div><p>The other day I stumbled on a tip about Evernote. It
was
<a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/10/28/one-student-made-productivity-habit/">a snippet of information in a bigger post on the Evernote blog</a>
so I saved it to Evernote (obviously) to take a look at later.</p>
<p>The tip was that Ctrl-Cmd-B in Evernote (on the Mac) will format a body of
text as source code. While I'm not in the habit of using Evernote to store
code, not even snippets of code (that's something far better served
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>), it seemed like something worth
committing to memory.</p>
<p>This morning, while finally in front of a suitable machine, I took a look.
Sure enough, there's the menu option.</p>
<p><img alt="Code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.36.42.png"></p>
<p>Handy! So I created a test note with some code in it so that I could see how
it formatted it. I was curious to see if it just did simple fixed text or if
it offered options to highlight various languages (I didn't hold out much
hope for the latter, but it was worth a look).</p>
<p>That's when it got odd.</p>
<p>After I created a note and went to format some code, the menu option
disappeared!</p>
<p><img alt="Lack of code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.37.07.png"></p>
<p>From what I can tell, once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. At
least, not until you actually close down Evernote and start it up again.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, none of this is the case in the Windows version. While the
key combination is different there, the menu option is available and stays
available.</p>
<p>The version of Evernote I have (on my iMac and my Macbook) is 6.9.2. The
version number on Windows is 6.4.2 (after checking for updates -- I'm going
to guess that the Mac and Windows version numbers don't match on purpose).</p>
<p>Goodness knows what's going on here. All I can imagine is that it has
something to do
with
<a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/97731-code-block-in-evernote-for-mac/">a thread I found on Evernote's support forum</a> that
suggests that code block formatting is some sort of test/beta feature and
can only be enabled via a settings option that <em>isn't</em> available via the
version downloaded from the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>So, at some point, I guess I'm going to have to uninstall Evernote from the
Macbook and the iMac, reinstall from the Evernote website itself, and try
this again. All of which seems a bit silly when <em>the menu option is there
and visible when I run Evernote up!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> Sure enough, removing the App Store version and installing
the version from Evernote's own website, and <em>then</em> going into preferences
and enabling the option, sorted it. It's still really odd they'd promote the
facility via the blog and not mention it, and also very odd that the option
would always show until the first time you're in a position to use it, and
then it'd disappear.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>By the looks of things, with the recent updates to their desktop applications,
Evernote have discovered the joys of pop-ups for advertising purposes. I'm
finding it just as annoying as it was back in the days when people thought it
was the smart way to make you buy things on the web.</p>
<p><img alt="Yay! Pop-up advertising!" src="/attachments/2015/07/09/Screen Shot 2015-07-09 at 16.15.25.png"></p>
<p>Now, to be fair, the pop-up you see above is the one on my iMac and that at
least has the good taste to only pop up <em>within</em> the application itself
(although the Evernote icon in the dock at the bottom of the screen kept
jumping around like it <em>really</em> wanted attention when this happened). The
Windows one, however, is much worse.</p>
<p>I've actually not had a chance to capture a copy yet as it normally has the
habit of getting in the way while I'm actually trying to do something; but
the Windows version has the bad taste to actually pop up over my desktop. Yes,
that's right, over my bloody desktop!</p>
<p>In both cases it's advertising Evernote's paid-for tiers in a way that it never
has before. It's seriously annoying.</p>
<p>Now, before anyone pipes up that it's a company that needs money to keep things
going... I know. I don't mind that. I don't mind the odd nag here and there.
More to the point I actually don't mind paying for software and services. I
actually do pay for software and services. There's a handful of different tools
and the like that I make good use of every month which I pay for because they're
worth paying for.</p>
<p>Evernote is one that I've been considering paying for too. The problem is, what
they offer in the paid versions isn't really anything I need. Everything I use
Evernote for can be done in the free version; I have no <em>need</em> to pay for it.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a good argument to be made in favour of the idea that if
you benefit from a service you should pay for it anyway so that it doesn't go
away. Having watched the likes of Catch and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springpad">Springpad</a> disappear I think that's
a very compelling argument and one that has had me, in recent months, thinking
I should buy some paid-for Evernote tier.</p>
<p>The problem I face now though is this: this move by Evernote to go with a
pop-up nagware model, especially one that's willing to pop up nagging windows
on my desktop, gives me the feeling that the company is struggling and getting
desperate. While this <em>should</em> have me thinking that now is a really good time
to pay for something I appreciate it's actually having the opposite effect.
It's having me wonder if, in fact, I should be looking for an alternative that
isn't giving this impression.</p>
<p>Yes, even one that I'd need to pay for.</p></div>
