  <div>
      <div><p>At the start of this year, as part of a much bigger process to review the
work that had taken place over the previous 12 months, I was asked (at work)
to provide some information about how much time I'd spent on various
projects. Now, for me, there's really only one project, but there's lots of
different tools and libraries that I've written to support the main work I
do. All of these are split into different repositories in the
company-internal instance of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>. This meant
that getting a rough idea of what I was working on and when would be easy
enough -- it's all there in the commit history.</p>
<p>Given that this information would make up a couple of slides at most during
a far bigger presentation, I wanted something that would be snappy and easy
for non-developers to follow and understand. I spent a bit of time pondering
some options and decided that (ab)using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">gantt
chart</a> layout would make sense.</p>
<p>That choice was made all the more easier given that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#mermaid">GitLab
supports</a> the use of
<a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">mermaid charts</a> within its
Markdown. This meant I could quickly write some code that took the git log
of each repository, turned it into mermaid code, and then render it (by
hand, this was all about getting things done quickly) via GitLab.</p>
<p>This sounded like it could be a fun personal project. The result was some
Python code called <a href="https://github.com/davep/git2gantt">git2gantt</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the output isn't anything too clever, it's just code
that can be used to create a plot via mermaid. For example, running
git2gannt over itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>gantt
  title git2gantt output
  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

  section git2gantt
  Development: devgit2gantt20190208, 2019-02-08, 2019-02-13
  Development: devgit2gantt20190214, 2019-02-14, 2019-02-15
  Development: devgit2gantt20190303, 2019-03-03, 2019-03-04
  Development: devgit2gantt20191203, 2019-12-03, 2019-12-04
</code></pre></div>

<p>Usage is pretty straightforward: <img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at
13.18.12.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.18.12.png">
As you can see, it can be run over multiple repos at once, and there's also
an option to have it consider every branch within each repository. Another
handy option is the ability to limit the output to just one author --
perhaps you just want to document what you've done on a repo, not the
contributions of other people.</p>
<p>Also especially handy, if you don't want to bore people with too much
detail, is the "fuzz" option. This lets you tell <code>git2gannt</code> how relaxed you
want it to be when it tries to decide how long a run of work on a repo
lasted. So, perhaps, you're working on and off on a library that supports
some other system you're documenting, but you might only be making changes
every other day or so. With the correct fuzz value you can make it clear you
were working <em>on</em> the library for a couple of weeks, despite there only
being a commit every other day.</p>
<p>An example of running the output over a handful of projects would look
something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png"></p>
<p>This is one of those tools I knocked up quickly to get a job done, and
haven't quite got round to finishing off fully. One thing I'd really like to
do is add mermaid support directly within it, so that it actually has the
option to emit plots, not just mermaid code (or, perhaps, drop the mermaid
approach and use something else entirely).</p>
<p>Meanwhile though, if you're looking for something quick and dirty that will
help you visualise what you've been working on and when for a good period of
time... perhaps this will help.</p></div>

    <p>
      Posted on 2019-10-26 13:19 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/python.html">Python</a>

          &#8226; Tagged with
              <a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/python.html">Python</a>,              <a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/documentation.html">documentation</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Something I always try to do when I'm coding is be consistent. I feel this
is important. While people's coding standards may differ, I think different
approaches are easier to handle if someone has been consistent with their
style across all of their code.</p>
<p>This also stands for documentation too.</p>
<p>In my current position, I do a <em>lot</em> of Python coding, and one of the things
I like about Python (there are things I don't like too, but that's not for
now) is that it has doc-strings (just like my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">favourite
language</a>). I use them
extensively, ensuring every function and method has some form of
documentation, and generally I use
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> to generate documentation
from those doc-strings.</p>
<p>Early on I was bothered by the fact that, just by the simple act of making
typos, I wasn't keeping the form of the doc-strings consistent. And in this
case it was a <em>really</em> simple thing that was bugging me. Normally, if I'm
writing a single-line doc-string, I'll write like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">one_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is a one-line doc-string.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far, so good. But, if the doc-string is a multi-liner, I prefer the
ending quotes to be on a line of their own, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But, sometimes, by accident, I'd leave a doc-string like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While it's really not a big deal, it would bug me and every time I found one
like this I'd "fix" it.</p>
<p>Eventually, it bugged me enough that I decided I was going to write a little
tool to find all such instances in my code and report them. My first
approach was to think "I could just do this with some regexp magic", <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">which
was really a bad idea</a>. Then I
though, I know, I should use this as an excuse to to play with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">Python's ast
library</a>.</p>
<p>That worked really well! I had <a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck/blob/dc5052002690b1f898ccd68f815cdedbe9172b74/pydscheck">the first version of the
code</a>
up and running in no time. It was simple but did the job. It ran through
Python code I threw at it and alerted me to both missing doc-strings, and
doc-strings with the ending I didn't like.</p>
<p>That served me for a while, until one day I realised that it wasn't quite
doing the job correctly; it was only really looking at top-level functions
and top-level methods in classes. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, I'll
define functions within functions, and I feel they deserve documentation
too. So then I modified the code to ensure it walked every part of the AST.</p>
<p>Since then, when I've run into new things and had new ideas, <code>pydscheck</code> has
grown and grown. I've added checks that all mentioned parameters have a
type; I've added checks that any function/method that returns something
actually documents the return value; I've added checks that any
documentation of a returned value includes its type; I've added checks that
any function or method that yields a value documents that fact; I've added
checks that ensure that every parameter is documented in some way.</p>
<p>Each time I've done this it's helped uncover issues in my code's
documentation that could be cleaner, and it's also given me a pet project to
slowly better understand Python's AST.</p>
<p>It could be that there are better tools out there, I'd have thought that a
good doc-string linting tool would be something someone had already written.
But this time around I was happy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> it because I needed a
fun learning exercise that would also have some benefits for my day-to-day
work.</p>
<p>I'll caveat this with the fact that it's very particular to how I work and
how I like my documentation to look, but if it sounds useful, here it is:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck">https://github.com/davep/pydscheck</a>.</p>
<p>There's still lots I could do with it. First off I should really properly
package it up so it can be installed as a command line tool via pip. Other
things that would be handy would be to allow some form of customisation of
how it works. I'm sure there's other fun things I can do with it too.</p>
<p>That's part of the fun of having a pet project: you can tinker when you like
and also get benefits from it as you use it.</p></div>
