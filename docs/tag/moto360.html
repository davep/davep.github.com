      <div><p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a creature of habit. Once I get used to
something I find it hard to change. In many areas of my life there has to be
really compelling reasons to change something. I've found that this is the
case with my Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>When I first got it it took me a couple or so days to find a face that I was
happy with and, in the end, I went with <a href="http://www.pujiewear.com/">Pujie Black</a>,
along with a colour scheme I set up myself (called <em>RGB</em>, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p><img alt="Pujie Black with RGB face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Pujie Black.png"></p>
<p>Today though I stumbled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.marscity.sunlight&amp;hl=en_GB">Krona Sunlight</a>.
This face really got my interest. Part of the reason is that, while what I'm
wearing is normally called a "watch", I don't see it as a watch (just like
my phone isn't really a phone). It's a wearable Android device that gives me
handy info at a glance and lets me set reminders and things without even
having to reach for my phone, tablet, Chromebook or desktop machine.</p>
<p>This face fits perfectly into that.</p>
<p><img alt="Krona Sunlight face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Krona Sunlight.png"></p>
<p>While it lacks the battery information (edit to add: it doesn't lack battery
information, it's just an option that is off by default), and second time display, that Pujie
Black has, it more than makes up for it with the rather fantastic display
of weather and sunrise/set information -- especially how it displays temperature.</p>
<p>This was enough to not only have me buy a copy, but also to switch to it. I'm
going to be sticking with it for the next couple of days to see how I feel
about it and see if I miss any of the other information.</p>
<p>This might be a little bit of change I can cope with.</p></div>

      <div><p>Following on from
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/06/25/did-google-just-break-wear-timers.html">yesterday's problem with the Android Wear timer</a>
I think I now have a solution. It came up
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/RZujypG7EyF">while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue</a>.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I've seen a number of
times before with Google stuff. One thing that's rather common (in many cases
for very obvious reasons -- you can't cover the whole world in one go) with
Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This
felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared
to be unaffected by the issue (I'm guessing he's on the latest version of
Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that
became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out
he was the same as me: British English.</p>
<p>So much for that idea.</p>
<p>But then he suggested switching to US English and back again.</p>
<p>Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft "turn it off and on again" approach to
a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and
really do suffer the same issues) I switched to en-US on the phone and tried
setting a timer in voice on the watch.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>So then I switched back to en-GB on the phone and...</p>
<p><img alt="I appear to have timers working again" src="/attachments/2015/06/26/Timer Running on Watch.png"></p>
<p>...it still worked!</p>
<p>I've tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it's yet
to fail.</p>
<p>It would appear, as odd as it is, that this is the fix. Well, a fix.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday evening I finally got the following notification on my Moto360:</p>
<p><img alt="Moto360 Update Notification" src="/attachments/2015/06/20/Moto360Update.png"></p>
<p>Given the charge was quite a way below that I took the watch off and put it
on charge and then did the update later.</p>
<p>From what I could tell it all went pretty smooth. After updating it even
offered me a little tutorial on some of the new things it's added. So far
I've used (or set up) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The much better "launcher"
  Finding and running apps on the watch was always a bit of a pain, so much so
  that others had even written special launchers for Android Wear. This seems
  to be pretty much solved now. Pressing and holding the watch's side button
  will pop up application list, from here you can swipe right to your
  contacts (them letting you send messages, start calls, etc) and right again
  for the usual list of actions that you used to go straight into.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way it's done now makes a lot more sense and seems far cleaner.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi
  I've yet to notice the benefit of this, but I've not paid too much attention
  yet either. The watch now does WiFi. This is supposed to mean that it can
  still work with my phone when it's out of Bluetooth range. I say I don't know
  if it's working yet because I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.derfreimann.wear.widgets.miniconnectionnotifier&amp;hl=en_GB">an app to tell me if my phone is out of
  range</a>
  and it still keeps tripping as normal -- but I'm unsure if that means
  it's simply telling me it's out of BT range but really the watch is now
  doing its thing over WiFi, or perhaps the phone connection really has been
  lost despite me having set up the WiFi connection. More testing needs to
  happen here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting this up was curious: I had to turn it on on the watch and then
  select the access points I wanted to work with, again on the watch. But to
  actually connect I had to switch back to my phone to enter the AP passwords
  (which makes perfect sense of course, nobody wants to type passwords into
  a watch face).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gestures
  These needed to be turned on in settings. I've being using them this morning
  to navigate cards on the watch and it's really well done and really natural.
  Simply put, you flick your wrist up, or down, to "flick" from one card to
  another. All it seems to be missing is some method of gesturing that I want
  to swipe a card out of the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than the above it's pretty much business as usual. Hopefully there's
been some work to improve battery life and all that sort of stuff, and only
time will tell if a difference has been made there.</p></div>
