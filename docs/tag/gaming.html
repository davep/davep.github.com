      <div><p>Back in 2021, I think it was, when Value first announced the Steam Deck, I
was all <em>"hell yes sign me up!"</em>; like... really, I signed up there and then
to go on the waiting list. The idea of a wee device that would let me play a
ton of games in my Steam library seemed like a great idea. The price seemed
right too.</p>
<p>So, I signed up, and waited, and waited, and life moved on.</p>
<p>When I finally (I think it was the best part of 18 months later?) got the
email saying my Deck was up for grabs and did I want to complete the
purchase I... said nah. By this point I was <em>so</em> heavily into VR gaming that
mucking with stuff on a Deck didn't seem to make much sense to me any more.</p>
<p>I moved on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks back they announced the OLED version and I took a second
look. There was now over a year of reviews to read, hacks to notice, fun to
follow; now I could get an idea if a Deck was any good and if it was for me.
So after a bit of review-reading and review-watching, Thursday last week, I
slapped down an order; and by Tuesday the Deck turned up.</p>
<p><img alt="New Deck getting going" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/new-deck.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The overturning of my original decision to <em>not</em> buy came down to a couple
of things. The first was: I recognised that there were a lot of games in my
library, sometimes things I'd bought (often in a sale), sometimes things I'd
got as part of a Humble Bundle, that just never got played. This, I noticed,
was sort of down to an unfortunate relationship I'd developed with gaming.</p>
<p>See... VR has won me over. I <em>love</em> gaming in VR. Also, I love recording my
gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">throwing them on
YouTube</a>. This means that, to some
extent, in my head, there's <em>effort</em> to getting going with playing a game:
I've got to power up the Windows PC; I've got to let it update stuff; I've
got to let Steam update stuff; I've got to power up the VR headset; I've got
to get it to connect to the PC (which generally works fine but on occasion
needs a complete restart of everything); I need to decide what I'm playing
next and what to record; I've got to get the recording software going; I've
got to...</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Also, of course, I've got to be in the right state to be okay with having a
computer strapped to my face (sometimes you don't feel 100% and being lost
in a virtual world isn't the best thing to be doing).</p>
<p>This can feel like too much effort. It also means that gaming tends to be
left for when I've got a few hours to dedicate to it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But I also <em>love</em> playing games.</p>
<p>My thinking then was a Deck would be a great way of "forcing" myself to play
the more casual stuff. There's no easy (that I know of) way to record or
stream from the Deck; it's also easy to have it on the sofa and turn it on
in a moment. This felt like the ideal device to have to hand, that was
dedicated to gaming, and which would encourage me to take smaller gaming
sessions when the time arises.</p>
<p>Like... sometimes I'll put something on to cook, come into the living room,
pick up the tablet and scroll through the Internet. While I try not to
doom-scroll too much, I can see that it would be more healthy to pick up the
Deck and play DooM!</p>
<p>So far, two days in, I'm convinced this was an excellent idea and I'm
totally won over.</p>
<p><img alt="My Steam Deck and Stream Deck" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/IMG_3842.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I'm still getting a feel for what does and doesn't work best on the Deck,
from a <em>"my taste in games"</em> point of view, but things that allow for
dipping in and having a quick blast are winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/741510/The_Hong_Kong_Massacre/">Hong Kong Massacre</a>
has finally got a play, despite me owning it ever since I saw John Wick 4.</p>
<p><img alt="Hong Kong Massacre" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/hong-kong.jpg#centre"></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">DooM II</a> got installed
and is working well -- I may have to slowly play my way through the whole
thing. I've also installed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255070/Abyss_Odyssey/">Abyss
Odyssey</a> and so
far am finding it quite charming and fun (it's an example of a game that
isn't really my kind of thing; but I got it in a Humble Bundle, I think, and
it's been sat there with 0 hours for way too long).</p>
<p>I've also failed to resist one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/434050/Duke_Nukem_3D_20th_Anniversary_World_Tour/">more questionable titles from my
younger days</a>...</p>
<p><img alt="Come get some" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/duke.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The real surprise for me though has been a game I bought on a whim a couple
of weeks back, which was going cheap, looked fun, seemed nice and casual and
which I installed on the PC and totally ignored (because, again, turning on
the PC to have a quick game seems like a lot of faff):
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/">Brotato</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Brotato" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/brotato.jpg"></p>
<p>This game is frantic, way over the top, kinda confusing in parts (for me)
but accessible enough that I can actually have a ton of fun with it; and
what's really important is that I can pick up the Deck, turn it on, play a
game of this for 10 minutes and then go on to do the thing I needed to do
next. It's the <em>perfect</em> game to play while waiting for the next step in
dinner to cook.</p>
<p>So, yeah, The Steam Deck... I'm won over; I'm so won over. And I haven't
even properly explored the fact that it has a full GNU/Linux desktop inside
it that I can use as a desktop machine...</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Some of this is also true with gaming on the PS5; while it's easier to
turn on and get going, and while I don't have a VR setup for it, I do
have it in my head that it's more for "epic gaming" than quick casual
stuff; see <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/">Death Stranding</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU">Cyberpunk
