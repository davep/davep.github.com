  <div>
      <div><p>Well, it didn't take as long as I expected it to. Just <a href="/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html#considering-pelican">yesterday
morning</a> I was
giving <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> a look over as a possible engine
for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while
now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I
liked it and wondered how long it would take me to make the switch.</p>
<p>By the evening I was making a proper effort to get the switchover started,
and just a wee while earlier, before writing this post, the switch was made!</p>
<p>The process of making the switch was roughly this (and keep in mind I'm
coming from using Jekyll):</p>
<ol>
<li>Made a branch in the repo to work in.</li>
<li>Removed all of the Jekyll-oriented files.</li>
<li>Decided to set up Pelican and related tools in a virtual environment,
   managed using <code>pipenv</code>.</li>
<li>Ran <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick things off and give me a framework to
   start with.</li>
<li>Renamed the old <code>_posts</code> directory to <code>content</code>.</li>
<li>Kept tweaking the hell out of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/blob/main/pelicanconf.py">Pelican config
   file</a>
   until it started to look "just so" (this is a process that has been
   ongoing, and doubtless will keep happening for some time to come).</li>
<li>Tried out a few themes and settled on
   <a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex">Flex</a>; while not <em>exactly</em>
   what I wanted, it was close enough to help keep me motivated (while
   rolling my own theme from scratch would seem fun, I just know it would
   mean the work would never get done, or at least finished).</li>
<li>Did a mass tidy up of all the tags in all the posts; something I'd never
   really paid too much attention to as the Jekyll-based blog never actually
   allowed for following tags.</li>
<li>Went though all the posts and removed double quotes from a lot of the
   titles in the frontmatter (something Jekyll seems to have stripped, but
   which Pelican doesn't).</li>
<li>Tweaked the <code>FILE_METADATA</code> to ensure that the slugs for the URLs came
    from the filenames -- by default Pelican seems to slugify the title of a
    post and this meant that some of the URLs were changing.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all I probably spent 6 or 7 hours on making the move; a lot of that
involving reading up on how to configure Pelican and researching themes. The
rest of it was a lot of repetitive work to fix or tidy things.</p>
<p><em>The</em> most important aspect of this was keeping the post URLs the same all
the way back to the first post; as best as I can tell I've managed that.</p>
<p>So far I'm pleased with the result. I'm going to live with the look/theme
for a wee while and see how it sits for me. I'm sure I'll tweak it a bit as
time goes on, but at the moment I'm comfortable with how it looks.</p></div>

      <div><p>Since getting my blog editing environment set up on the "new" machine <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">a
couple of days back</a> I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog <a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html">back in 2015</a>, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912">mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new</a>, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.</p>
<p>One that looks promising so far is <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).</li>
<li>Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).</li>
<li>Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.</li>
<li>Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web">using the library when kicking
  off <code>ng2web</code></a>).</li>
<li>RSS feed generation.</li>
<li>Syntax-highlighted code blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.</p>
<p>Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.</p>
<p>Things got off to a good start with an easy install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;pelican[markdown]&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then used the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a <em>very</em> rough
version of my blog up and going.</p>
<p>It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.</p>
<p>I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a base theme that's to my taste.</li>
<li>Get Disqus working it so that any old comments remain in place.</li>
<li>Get my image/attachment layout back in place.</li>
<li>Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).</li>
<li>Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.</li>
<li>Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!</p>
<p>Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.
;-)</p>

      <div><p><img alt="My new GitHub banner" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/davep/main/davep.svg"></p>
<p>Ever since GitHub introduced the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme">profile
README</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
I've had a massively low-effort one in place. I made the repo, quickly wrote
the file, and then sort of forgot about it. Well, I didn't so much forget as
just keep looking at it and thinking "I should do something better with that
one day".</p>
<p>Thing is, while there are lots of fancy approaches out there, and lots of
neat generator tools and the like... they just weren't for me.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, over my second morning coffee, after <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">getting my blog
environment up and going again</a>, I had an
idea. It could be cool to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.save_screenshot">Textual's screenshot
facility</a>
to make something terminal-themed! I mean, while it's not <em>all</em> I am these
days, so much of what I'm doing right now is aimed at the terminal.</p>
<p>So... what to do? Then I thought it could be cool to knock up some sort of
login screen type thing; with a banner. One visit to an online large
terminal text generator site later, I had some banner text. All that was
left was to write <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep/blob/main/make_banner.py">a simple Textual application to create the
"screen"</a>.</p>
<p>The main layout is simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">compose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">ComposeResult</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NAME</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">classes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;banner&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PRATTLE</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;github.com/davep login: [reverse] [/]&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>where <code>NAME</code> contains the banner and <code>PRATTLE</code> contains the "login message".
With some <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/CSS/">Textual CSS</a> sprinkled
over it to give the exact layout and colour I wanted, all that was left was
to make the snapshot. This was easy enough too.</p>
<p>While the whole thing isn't fully documented just yet, Textual does have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.run_test">a
great tool for automatically running an application and interacting with
it</a>; that
meant I could easily write a function to load up my app and save the
screenshot:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_banner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">GitHubBannerApp</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run_test</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pilot</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">pilot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save_screenshot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;davep.svg&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, that needs running async, but that's simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">make_banner</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Throw in a <code>Makefile</code> so I don't forget what I'm supposed to run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nl">.PHONY:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">all</span>
<span class="nl">all:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">pipenv</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">run</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">python</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">make_banner.py</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and that's it! Job done!</p>
<p>From here onward I guess I could have some real fun with this. It would be
simple enough I guess to modify the code so that it changes what's displayed
over time; perhaps show a "last login" value that relates to recently
activity or something; any number of things; and then run it in a cron job
and update the repository.</p>
<p>For now though... I'll stick with keeping things nice and simple.</p>

      <div><p>Another little thing that's up on PyPi now, which is the final bit of
fallout from <a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">the Textual dogfooding
sessions</a>, is a little project I'm
calling OIDIA.</p>
<p>The application is a streak tracker. I'm quite the fan of streak trackers.
I've used a few over the years, both to help keep me motivated and honest,
and also to help me track that I've avoided unhelpful things too. Now, most
of the apps I've used, and use now, tend to have reminders and counts and
stats and are all about "DO NOT BREAK THE STREAK OR ELSE" and that's mostly
fine, but...</p>
<p>To keep things simple and to purely concentrate on how to build Textual
apps, I made this a "non-judgement" streak tracker. It's designed to be
really simple: you add a streak, you bump up/down the number of times you
did (or didn't do) the thing related to that streak, for each day, and
that's it.</p>
<p>No totals. No stats. No reminders and bugging. No judgement.</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>When I started it, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to store the data.
Throwing it in a SQLite database held some appeal, but that also felt like a
lot of faff for something so simple. Also, I wanted to make the data as easy
to get at, to use elsewhere, and to hack on, as possible. So in the end I
went with a simple JSON file.</p>
<p>On macOS and GNU/Linux <code>streaks.json</code> lives in <code>~/.local/share/oidia</code>, on
Windows it'll be in... I'm not sure off the top of my head actually; it'll
be in whatever directory <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xdg/">the handy <code>xdg</code>
library</a> has chosen. and because it's JSON
that means that something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="OIDIA in action" src="/attachments/2022/12/16/oidia.png"></p>
<p>ends up looking like this:</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how well that actually scales; possibly not
so well over a long period of time, but this was written more as another way
to explore Textual than anything else. Even then, it would be pretty trivial
to update to something better for holding the data.</p>
<p>If this seems like your thing (and I will be supporting it and onward
developing it) you <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oidia/">can find it over on
PyPi</a>, which means it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or the ever-handy <code>pipx</code>:</p>

      <div><h1>An update</h1>
<p>So, it's fast approaching 2 months now <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">since I started the new
thing</a> and it's been a busy
time. I've had to adjust to a quite a few new things, not least of which has
been a longer and more involved commute. I'm actually mostly enjoying it
too. While having to contend with busses isn't the <em>best</em> thing to be doing
with my day, I do have a very fond spot for Edinburgh and it's nice to be in
there most days of the week.</p>
<p>Part of the fallout from the new job has been that, in the last couple of
weeks, I've thrown some more stuff up on PyPi. This comes about as part of a
bit of a dog-fooding campaign we're on at the moment (you can read some
background to this <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">over on the company
blog</a>).
While they have been, and will continue to be, mentioned on the Textualize
blog, I thought I'd give a brief mention of them here on my own blog too
given they are, essentially, personal projects.</p>
<h1>gridinfo</h1>
<p>This is one I'd like to tweak some more and improve on if possible. It is,
in essence, a Python-coded terminal tool that does more or less the same as
<a href="https://github.com/davep/slstats.el"><code>slstats.el</code></a>. It started out as <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1590476280457490434">a
rather silly quick
hack</a>, designed
to do something different with
<a href="https://github.com/darrenburns/rich-pixels"><code>rich-pixels</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here's the finished version (as of the time of writing) being put through
its paces:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gridinfo/">from here</a>, or install and
play with it with a quick <code>pipx install gridinfo</code>.</p>
<h1>unbored</h1>
<p>The next experiment with Textual was to write a terminal-based client for
the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">Bored-API</a>. My initial plan for this was to
just have a button or two that the user could mash on and they'd get an
activity suggestion dropped into the middle of the terminal; but really that
seemed a bit boring. Then I realised that it'd be a bit more silly and a bit
more fun if I did it as a sort of TODO app. Bored? Run it up and use one of
the activities you'd generated before. Don't like any of them? Ignore them
and generate some more! Feeling bad that you've got such a backlog of
reasons to not be bored? Delete a bunch!</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Here's a short video of it in action:</p>

</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/unbored/">from here</a>, or install and play
with it with a quick <code>pipx install unbored</code>.</p>
<h1>textual-qrcode</h1>
<p>This one... this one I'm going to blame on the brain fog that followed flu
<em>and</em> Covid jabs that happened the day before (and which are still kicking
my arse 4 days later). Monday morning, at my desk, and I'm wondering what to
next write to experiment with Textual, and I realised it would be
interesting to write something that would show off that it's easy to make a
third party widget library.</p>
<p>And... yeah, I don't know why, but I remembered
<a href="https://github.com/davep/qrencode.el"><code>qrencode.el</code></a> and so
<code>textual-qrcode</code> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="The most useless Textal widget yet" src="/attachments/2022/12/01/textual-qrcode.png"></p>
<p>I think the most amusing part about this is that I did it in full knowledge
that it would be useless; the idea being it would be a daft way of showing
off how you could build a widget library as an add-on for Textual. But...
more than one person actually ended up saying "yeah hold up there this could
actually be handy!"</p>
<p>If you're one of those people... <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-qrcode/">you'll find it
here</a>.</p>
<h1>FivePyFive</h1>
<p>While I was on a roll putting stuff up on PyPi, I also decided to tweak up
my Textual-based 5x5 and throw that up too. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1554207518615814148">my first app built
with Textual</a>,
initially written before I'd even spoken to Will about the position here. At
one point I even did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual/blob/c4f60548922609133763c0e49f7b23aea5d44c2b/sandbox/davep/five_by_five.hy">a version in
Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>It's since gone on to become <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/tree/d2ba22b86f48f4ce5b0f55767efdcf1a5478b180/examples">one of the example apps in Textual
itself</a>
but I felt it deserved being made available to the world via an easy(ish)
install. So, if you fancy trying to crack the puzzle in your terminal, just
do a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>fivepyfive
</code></pre></div>

<p>and click away.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="343" height="610"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf34Z5r7Q60" title="FivePyFive -- A
little annoying puzzle for the terminal" frameborder="0"
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fivepyfive/">over here</a>.</p>
<h1>PISpy</h1>
<p>Finally... for this week anyway, is a tool I've called PISpy. It's designed
as a simple terminal client for looking up package information on PyPi. As
of right now it's pretty straightforward, but I'd like to add more to it
over time. Here's an example of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMGD6bXqIEo" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>One small wrinkle with publishing it to PyPi was the fact that, once I'd
chosen the name, I checked that it hadn't been used on PyPi (it hadn't) but
when it came to publishing the package it got rejected because the name was
too similar to another package! I don't know which, it wouldn't say, but
that was a problem. So in the end the published name ended up having to be
slightly different from the actual tool's name.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">over here</a> for the package, and
you can install it with a:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pispy-client
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then just run <code>pispy</code> in the terminal.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's been a fun couple of weeks coming up with stuff to help exercise
Textual, and there's more to come. Personally I've found the process really
helpful in that it's help me learn more about the framework and also figure
out my own approach to working with it. Each thing I've built so far has
been a small step in evolution on from what I did in the previous thing. I
doubt I've arrived at a plateau of understanding just yet.</p></div>

      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>On Twitter, a few weeks back, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsBexli/status/1577332548933500928">@itsBexli asked me how I go about setting up
Python for development on
macOS</a>. It's a
great question and one that seems to crop up in various places, and since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I
first got into using
macOS</a> and then
<a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">subsequently got back into coding lots in
Python</a> it's absolutely an issue I ran
into.</p>
<p>With my previous employer, while I was the only developer, I wasn't the only
person writing code and more than one other person had this issue so I
eventually wrote up my approach to solving this problem. That document is on
their internal GitLab, but I thought it worth me writing my personal
macOS/Python "rules" up again, just in case they're useful to anyone else.</p>
<p>I am, of course, not the first person to tackle this, to document this, to
write down a good approach to this. Before and after I settled on my
approach I'd seen other people write about this. So... this post isn't here
to try and replace those, it's simply to write down my own approach, so if
anyone asks again I can point them here. I feel it's important to stress:
this isn't the only way or thoughts on this issue, there are lots of others.
Do go read them too and then settle on an approach that works for you.</p>
<p>One other point to note, which may or may not make a difference (and may or
may not affect how this changes with time): for the past few years I've been
a heavy user of <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"><code>pipenv</code></a> to manage my
virtual environments. This is very likely to change from now on, but keep in
mind that what follows was arrived at from the perspective of a <code>pipenv</code>
user.</p>
<p>So... with that admin aside...</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>When I first got back into writing Python it was on macOS and, really early
on, I ran into all the usual issues: virtual environments breaking because
they were based on the system Python and it got updated, virtual
environments based on the Homebrew-installed Python and it got updated,
etc... Simply put, an occasional, annoying, non-show-stopping breaking of my
development environment which would distract me when I'd sat down to just
hack on some code, not do system admin!</p>
<h1>My Solution</h1>
<p>For me, what's worked for me without a problem over the past few years, in
short, is this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the system version of Python. Just don't.</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the Homebrew's own version of Python (I'm not even sure
   this is an issue any more; but it used to be).</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use a version of Python installed with Homebrew (or, more to
   the point, never install Python with Homebrew).</li>
<li>Manage everything with <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/"><code>pyenv</code></a>; which I do
   install from Homebrew.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Detail</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, what I'm writing here assumes that virtual
environments are being managed with <code>pipenv</code> (something I still do for
personal projects, for now, but this may change soon). Your choices and
mileage may vary, etc... This is what works well for me.</p>
<h2>The "one time" items</h2>
<p>These are the items that need initially installing into a new macOS machine:</p>
<h3>Homebrew</h3>
<p>Unless it comes from the Mac App Store, I try and install everything via
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. It's really handy for keeping track of what
I've got installed, for recreating a development environment in general, and
for keeping things up to date.</p>
<h3>pyenv</h3>
<p>With Homebrew installed the next step for me is to install <code>pyenv</code>. Doing so
is as easy as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pyenv
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once installed, if it's not done it for you, you may need to make some
changes to your login profile. I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a>
so I have <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/efc77fd20c4bd2f36eb628730787924b6a56fcfd/conf.d/python.fish#L21-L25">these lines in my
setup</a>.
Simply put: it asks pyenv to set up my environment so my calls to Python go
via its setup.</p>
<p>Plenty of help on how to set up <code>pyenv</code> can be found <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation">in its
README</a>.</p>
<p>Once I've done this I tend to go on and install the Python versions I'm
likely to need. For me this tends to be the most recent "active" stable
versions (as of the time of writing, 3.7 through 3.10; although I need to
now start throwing 3.11 into the mix too).</p>
<p>I use this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--list
</code></pre></div>

<p>to see the available versions. If I want to see what's available for a
specific version I'll pipe through grep:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--list<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>fgrep<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;  3.9&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is handy if I want to check what the very latest release of a specific
version of Python is.</p>
<h3>The "Global" Python</h3>
<p>When I'm done with the above I then tend to use <code>pyenv</code> to set my "global"
Python. This is the version I want to get when I run <code>python</code> and I'm not
inside a virtual environment. Doing that is as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>global<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, you'd swap the version for whatever works for you.</p>
<h3>When Stuff Breaks</h3>
<p>It seems more rare these days, but on occasion I've had it such that some
update somewhere still causes my environment to break. Now though I find
that all it takes is a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>rehash
</code></pre></div>

<p>and everything is good again.</p>
<h2>Setting Up A Repo</h2>
<p>With all of the stuff above being mostly a one-off (or at least something I
do once when I set up a new machine -- which isn't often), the real "work"
here is when I set up a fresh repository when I start a new project. Really
it's no work at all. Again, as I've said before, I've tended to use <code>pipenv</code>
for my own work, and still do for personal stuff (but do want to change
that), mileage may vary here depending on tool.</p>
<p>When I start a new project I think about which Python version I want to be
working with, I ensure I have the latest version of it installed with
<code>pyenv</code>, and then ask <code>pipenv</code> to create a new virtual environment with
that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you do this, you should see <code>pipenv</code> pulling the version of Python from
the <code>pyenv</code> directories:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7

</code></pre></div>

<p>The key thing here is seeing that <code>pipenv</code> is pulling Python from
<code>~/.pyenv/versions/</code>. If it isn't there's a good chance you have a Python
earlier in your <code>PATH</code> than the <code>pyenv</code> one -- something you generally don't
want. It will work, but it's more likely to break at some point in the
future. That's the key thing I look for; if I see that I know things are
going to be okay.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since I adopted these personal rules and approaches (and really, calling
them "rules" is kind of grand -- there's almost nothing to this) I've found
I've had near-zero issues with the stability of my Python virtual
environments (and what issues I have run into tend to be trivial and of my
own doing).</p>
<p>As I said at the start: there are, of course, other approaches to this, but
this is mine and works well for me. Do feel free to comment with your own,
I'm always happy to learn about new ways!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Just over five years ago I got a message from my then employer to say I was
going to be made redundant after 21 years working for them. After the 3
month notice period the final day came. Meanwhile, I found something new
that <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">looked terrifying but
interesting</a>. In the end it was less
terrifying and way more interesting than I imagined it would be. It was fun
too.</p>
<p>But... (there's always a but isn't there?)</p>
<p>In the four and change years I've been there the company got bought out, and
then the result of that got bought up. As I've mentioned before I'm
generally not a "big company" kind of person; in all my years I've found
that I'm happier working in a smaller place. After a couple of buyouts my
employer had gone from being 10s of people in size to 100s of people in size
(and technically 10s of 1,000s of people in size depending on how you look
at it).</p>
<p>This change in ownership and size meant the culture became... well, let's
just say not as friendly as you tend to enjoy when it's a smaller group of
folk. On top of that I was starting to notice that my efforts were making
less of an impact as things got bigger, and I started to feel like my
contributions weren't really relevant any more. There were some problematic
things happening too: undermining of efforts, removal of responsibilities
without consultation or communication, that sort of thing. Plus worse.
There's little point in going into the detail, but it's fair to say that
work wasn't as fun as it used to be.</p>
<p>That felt like a good time to start to look around. If work makes you feel
unhappy and you can look around... look around.</p>
<p>Thing is, I wasn't sure what to look for. I was in the comfortable position
of, unlike last time, not <em>needing</em> to find something, so I could take my
time at least. Over the course of the last year I've spoken to many
different companies and organisations, some big (yes, I know, I said I don't
like big places -- sometimes what's on offer deserves a fair hearing), some
small, but none of them quite said <em>"this feels like me"</em>. In some cases the
whole thing didn't have the right vibe, in others the industry either didn't
interest me, or felt uncomfortable given my personal values. In one
particular case a place looked interesting until I checked the CTO's socials
and OMG NO NO NO AVOID AVOID (that was a fun one).</p>
<p>Then I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan">Will McGugan</a> saying he was
hiring to expand <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>. This caught my
interest right away for two good reasons.</p>
<p>I can't remember how long I've been following Will on Twitter; I likely
stumbled on him as I got back into Python in 2018 and I also remember noting
that he was a Python hacker just up the road from me. We'd vaguely chatted
on Twitter, briefly, in that "Twitter acquaintance" way we all often do (I
remember <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1438887277623750661">one brief exchange about fungus on The
Meadows</a>), and
he'd seemed like a good sort. A small company run by a "good sort" kinda
person felt like a damn good reason.</p>
<p>The second reason was Textual itself. I'd been watching Will develop it, in
open, with great interest. I had (and still have) a plan to write a brand
new CHUI-based (okay fine TUI-based as the kids like to say these days!)
Norton Guide reader, all in Python, and Textual looked like the perfect
framework to do the UI in. The chance to be involved with it sounded
awesome.</p>
<p>Now, I said two reasons, but there's also a third I guess: Will's pitch for
applying to Textualize felt so damn accessible! I'm on the older end of the
age range of this industry; for much of my working life as a developer I've
worked in isolation from other developers; while I first touched Python in
the 90s, I've only been using it in anger since 2018 and still feel like
I've got a lot to learn. Despite all these things, and more, saying <em>"aye
Dave this is beyond you"</em> I felt comfortable dropping Will a line.</p>
<p>Which resulted in a chat.</p>
<p>Which resulted in some code tinkering and chatting.</p>
<p>Which resulted in...</p>
<p>Something new.</p>
<p>So, yeah, as of 2022-10-10 I'm on yet another new adventure. Time for me to
<em>really</em> work on my Python coding as I work with Will and the rest of the
team as part of Textualize.</p>
<p>Or, as I put it on Twitter a few days ago: <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1574121611413921792">I'm going to be a Python
impostor syndrome
speedrunner</a>!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I first learnt Python back in the mid-to-late 90s, used it in place of Perl
once I was comfortable with it, and then we sort of drifted apart when I
first met Ruby. It's only in the last couple of years that I've got back
into it, and in a huge way, thanks to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">my (not-quite-so-) new
job</a>. Despite
the quirks and oddness (as I perceive them), I actually quite like Python
and it's one of those languages that just flows off my fingers. I'm sure you
know the same thing, perhaps not with Python, but there will be languages
that just flow for you, and those that take a bit more effort and
concentration. Python... feels okay to me.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that there's been a long-standing style guide. I quite
like <a href="python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> as a read, and think there's a
lot of good ideas in there; much of the content sits with how I'd approach
things if I was tasked to come up with such a document. With this in mind,
I'm a fairly heavy user of <code>pylint</code> and it in turn leans on PEP 8 (amongst
other things) and I'm happy to accept most of its judgements. Not all of its
judgements, <a href="/2019/11/04/my-pylint-shame.html">but even when I disagree with it I try and keep track of how
far I'm
drifting</a>.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely one hill I will happily die on when it comes to PEP
8: the concept of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements">"extraneous whitespace" in lists and
expressions</a>.
Just.... no! Oh gods no!</p>
<p>To borrow a line of code from <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">the journey problem I dabbled with a while
back</a>,
PEP 8 would have me write something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">commands</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">state</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, I'm sure plenty of people won't see a problem with this at all; but all
I can see is an almost-claustrophobic parameter list. What's with the
parameters being jammed up against the opening and closing parens? Why have
the dinky little comma lost between two different things? Why have it look
like a long stream of letters and punctuation? Why....</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just no.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly, I just need for the code to breathe a bit. When I type
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">commands</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="nb">str</span> <span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">State</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>suddenly if feels like there's fresh air in the code, like it flows gently
out of my head, off my fingers, through the keyboard and into the buffer.</p>
<p>In my head, and to my eyes, the code is.... relaxed.</p>
<p>Do I have a rational reason for this? Nope. Then again I don't see one for
doing it the other way either; I can't think of one and I don't see one in
the source document. So, that's a warning I always turn off with <code>pylint</code>
and it's a style I carry through all my Python code; and I think that's the
important point here: anyone reading and working with my code should see the
same style all the way through. It might differ from PEP 8 on this point,
but at least it's the same all the way.</p>
<p>And, really, that's okay: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds">PEP 8 is there to be
ignored</a>.
;-)</p>
<p>PS: This is a small part of another blog post I was meaning to write, and
might still do, about my (still ongoing) experience of getting
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode"><code>lsp-mode</code></a> up and running in Emacs
and having it play nice with Python projects. I have that working, but it
was a bit of a learning curve and epic battle over a couple of days, and one
that had me first encounter
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/"><code>pycodestyle</code></a>. I may still tell the
tale...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier this week something in my development environment, relating to
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, Python,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> and
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">pipenv</a>, got updated and broke a handful
of repositories. Not in a way that I couldn't recover from, just in a way
that was annoying, got in the way of my workflow, and needed attention.
<em>(note to self: how I set up for Python/Django development on a machine
might be a good post in the future)</em></p>
<p>Once I was sure what the fix was (pretty much: nuke the virtual environment
and recreate it with <code>pipenv</code>, being very explicit about the version of
Python to use) the next step was to figure out how many repositories were
affected; not all were and there wasn't an obvious pattern to it. What was
obvious was that the problem came down to <code>python</code> in the <code>.venv</code> directory
pointing to a binary that didn't exist any more.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png" src="/attachments/2020/07/10/Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png"></p>
<p>So... tracking down problematic repositories would be simple enough, just
look for every instance of <code>.venv/bin/python</code> and be sure it points to
something rather than nothing; if it points to nothing I need to remake the
virtual environment.</p>
<p>I quickly knocked up a script that was based around looking over the results
of a <code>find</code>, and initially decided to use <code>file</code> to perform the test on
<code>python</code>. It seemed to make sense, as I wrote the script I checked the <code>man</code>
page for <code>file(1)</code> on macOS and sure enough, this exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-E On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that <code>file</code> dereferences links by default, that should get me an error
for a broken link, right? Bit hacky I guess, but it was the first thing that
came to mind for a quick bit of scripting and would do the trick. Only...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Wat</a>?!? But it's right there! It says so in the manual! <code>-E</code> is documented right in the manual page! And yet it's not in the valid switch list as put out by the command, <em>and</em> it's an <code>invalid option</code>. The hell?</p>
<p>So I go back and look at the <code>man</code> page again and then I notice it isn't in
the list of switches in the synopsis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br>
    file [-bcdDhiIkLnNprsvz] [--extension] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] [-P name=value] [-M magicfiles] file<br>
    file -C [-m magicfiles]<br>
    file [--help]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then did the obvious tests. Did I have <code>file</code> aliased in some way? No. Was
some other thing that works and acts like <code>file</code> in my path? No. Was I
absolutely 100% using <code>/usr/bin/file</code>? Yes.</p>
<p>Long story short: it seems the <code>man</code> page for <code>file</code>, on macOS, fibs about
what switches it supports; it says that <code>-E</code> is a valid option, but it's not
there.</p>
<p>What's even odder is the man page says it documents v5.04 of the command,
but <code>--version</code> reports v5.37. Meanwhile, if I check on a GNU/Linux box I
have access to, it does support <code>-E</code>, reports it in the switches, documents
it in the <code>man</code> page (in both the synopsis and in the main body of the page)
and it is v5.25 (and so is its man page).</p>
<p>So that was something like 20 minutes lost to a very small problem, for
which there was no real solution, but was time that had to be spent to get
to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>In the end I went with what I probably should have gone with in the first
place: <code>stat -L</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>venv<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-name<span class="w"> </span>.venv<span class="k">)</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now I have that script in my <code>~/bin</code> directory, ready for the next time
Homebrew and friends conspire to throw my day off for a while.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>At the start of this year, as part of a much bigger process to review the
work that had taken place over the previous 12 months, I was asked (at work)
to provide some information about how much time I'd spent on various
projects. Now, for me, there's really only one project, but there's lots of
different tools and libraries that I've written to support the main work I
do. All of these are split into different repositories in the
company-internal instance of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>. This meant
that getting a rough idea of what I was working on and when would be easy
enough -- it's all there in the commit history.</p>
<p>Given that this information would make up a couple of slides at most during
a far bigger presentation, I wanted something that would be snappy and easy
for non-developers to follow and understand. I spent a bit of time pondering
some options and decided that (ab)using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">gantt
chart</a> layout would make sense.</p>
<p>That choice was made all the more easier given that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#mermaid">GitLab
supports</a> the use of
<a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">mermaid charts</a> within its
Markdown. This meant I could quickly write some code that took the git log
of each repository, turned it into mermaid code, and then render it (by
hand, this was all about getting things done quickly) via GitLab.</p>
<p>This sounded like it could be a fun personal project. The result was some
Python code called <a href="https://github.com/davep/git2gantt">git2gantt</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the output isn't anything too clever, it's just code
that can be used to create a plot via mermaid. For example, running
git2gannt over itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>gantt
  title git2gantt output
  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

  section git2gantt
  Development: devgit2gantt20190208, 2019-02-08, 2019-02-13
  Development: devgit2gantt20190214, 2019-02-14, 2019-02-15
  Development: devgit2gantt20190303, 2019-03-03, 2019-03-04
  Development: devgit2gantt20191203, 2019-12-03, 2019-12-04
</code></pre></div>

<p>Usage is pretty straightforward: <img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at
13.18.12.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.18.12.png">
As you can see, it can be run over multiple repos at once, and there's also
an option to have it consider every branch within each repository. Another
handy option is the ability to limit the output to just one author --
perhaps you just want to document what you've done on a repo, not the
contributions of other people.</p>
<p>Also especially handy, if you don't want to bore people with too much
detail, is the "fuzz" option. This lets you tell <code>git2gannt</code> how relaxed you
want it to be when it tries to decide how long a run of work on a repo
lasted. So, perhaps, you're working on and off on a library that supports
some other system you're documenting, but you might only be making changes
every other day or so. With the correct fuzz value you can make it clear you
were working <em>on</em> the library for a couple of weeks, despite there only
being a commit every other day.</p>
<p>An example of running the output over a handful of projects would look
something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png"></p>
<p>This is one of those tools I knocked up quickly to get a job done, and
haven't quite got round to finishing off fully. One thing I'd really like to
do is add mermaid support directly within it, so that it actually has the
option to emit plots, not just mermaid code (or, perhaps, drop the mermaid
approach and use something else entirely).</p>
<p>Meanwhile though, if you're looking for something quick and dirty that will
help you visualise what you've been working on and when for a good period of
time... perhaps this will help.</p></div>
