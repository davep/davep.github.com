  <div>
      <div><p>Sometimes I can have an idea for a Textual widget, library or application on
my ideas list for weeks, months even, before I get around to it -- mostly
just due to not having the clear time to make a run at getting it going --
and then other times an idea can pop into my head and it <em>has</em> to be created
there and then. <strong>Has</strong> to be!</p>
<p>This happened yesterday evening.</p>
<p>While the tool I built is something I'd thought of before (back around
November last year I think) it hadn't even made it to my <em>"list of stuff I
should make"</em> that I keep in Apple Reminders; not sure why really. But then
yesterday evening a question cropped up on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Textual Discord
server</a> that related to the subject and I was
reminded of it.</p>
<p>The subject being: <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/">Textual DOM
queries</a>. I like to think that
DOM queries in Textual are pretty easy to do, and well-explained in the
docs, but it's fair to admit that they need a bit of practice first, just
like any powerful tool. So I was reminded that I'd wanted to write a sandbox
application, that would have a practice DOM inside it, an input field to
type in a query, and a way of displaying the results.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-query-sandbox"><code>textual-query-sandbox</code></a>
was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Query Sandbox" src="/attachments/2023/09/01/tqs.png#centre"></p>
<p>In this very first version (which was <em>really</em> quickly put together -- it
was something like 15 minutes to write the main code and then probably 45
minutes tweaking styles, adding all the admin stuff to allow <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-query-sandbox/">deployment to
PyPi</a> and writing the
README) there's an <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/input/"><code>Input</code></a>,
a display of a group of nested containers with different IDs and classes,
and then a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/pretty/"><code>Pretty</code></a> widget
at the bottom to show the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/#query-objects"><code>query</code></a>
result.</p>
<p>If you think this looks like it might be useful to you, it can be installed
using either <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-query-sandbox
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then you can run it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>tqs
</code></pre></div>

<p>At which point load up the Textual query docs, type queries into the input
field, hit enter and see what gets highlighted and which widgets end up in
the result set at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Like I say: this was a quick hack yesterday evening, I think there's a lot
more can go into this. For one thing I think a more interesting practice DOM
would be a good idea, with a good mix of widgets; another thing could be
having a collection of different DOM playgrounds that can be switched
between (a <code>TabbedContent</code> of different playgrounds could be fun here); this
could even be taken further such that the user can create their own
playground DOM to practice against.</p>
<p>Eventually it would be neat if this could be turned into a library that can
be included in a Textual application, as a development-time debug tool, so
that on-the-fly test queries can be made.</p>
<p>For now though, it's started, it's under way, and I think the current
version probably covers 90% of the use cases for something like this; making
for a really quick and easy tool to double-check how to query something.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">Late on last year</a> I wrote about a
bunch of new things that I'd added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an
early <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">dog-fooding session we had at textual
HQ</a>.
Since then I've been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to
date with Textual.</p>
<p><img alt="Unbored" src="/attachments/2023/08/13/unbored.png#centre"></p>
<p>As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework,
but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there's still new ways of
doing things being designed so there's going to be the odd break in approach
now and again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/unbored">Unbored</a>, my kind of silly
self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x
for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with
0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple
of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn't crashing.</p>
<p>The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of
containers (they didn't used to receive focus by default, now they do so I
had to tell them not to again), and that was about it.</p>
<p>While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZsXGQQpFw">nifty little slide-in error dialog I'd
made</a>, and instead embraced
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/07/17/textual-0300-adds-desktop-style-notifications/">the new Textual notification
system</a>.</p>
<p>While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no <em>real</em> use to
anyone, I feel it's a pretty good barometer application, helping me check
what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual
application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual
dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested
way; for this though it's less crucial and is a good test of the state of
the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it'll be
helpful to me if it <em>does</em> break and they yell.</p></div>

<p>Given that for a good chunk of this year I've been a bit lax about writing
here, there's a couple or so coding projects I've not written about (well,
not on <em>here</em> anyway -- I have spoken lots about them <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep">over on
Fosstodon</a>). One such project is
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-canvas/"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>.</p>
<p>As the name might suggest, it's a "canvas" for Textual applications, which
provides a pretty basic interface for drawing pixels, lines and circles --
and of course any other shape you are able to build up from those basics.</p>
<p>I've just <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/releases/tag/v0.2.0">released a quick
update</a> after
it was <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/discussions/1">requested that I add a <code>clear</code> method to the <code>Canvas</code>
widget</a>; a request
that makes perfect sense.</p></div>

      <div><p>Another little thing that's up on PyPi now, which is the final bit of
fallout from <a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">the Textual dogfooding
sessions</a>, is a little project I'm
calling OIDIA.</p>
<p>The application is a streak tracker. I'm quite the fan of streak trackers.
I've used a few over the years, both to help keep me motivated and honest,
and also to help me track that I've avoided unhelpful things too. Now, most
of the apps I've used, and use now, tend to have reminders and counts and
stats and are all about "DO NOT BREAK THE STREAK OR ELSE" and that's mostly
fine, but...</p>
<p>To keep things simple and to purely concentrate on how to build Textual
apps, I made this a "non-judgement" streak tracker. It's designed to be
really simple: you add a streak, you bump up/down the number of times you
did (or didn't do) the thing related to that streak, for each day, and
that's it.</p>
<p>No totals. No stats. No reminders and bugging. No judgement.</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kz8eUzO9-8"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>When I started it, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to store the data.
Throwing it in a SQLite database held some appeal, but that also felt like a
lot of faff for something so simple. Also, I wanted to make the data as easy
to get at, to use elsewhere, and to hack on, as possible. So in the end I
went with a simple JSON file.</p>
<p>On macOS and GNU/Linux <code>streaks.json</code> lives in <code>~/.local/share/oidia</code>, on
Windows it'll be in... I'm not sure off the top of my head actually; it'll
be in whatever directory <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xdg/">the handy <code>xdg</code>
library</a> has chosen. and because it's JSON
that means that something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="OIDIA in action" src="/attachments/2022/12/16/oidia.png"></p>
<p>ends up looking like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how well that actually scales; possibly not
so well over a long period of time, but this was written more as another way
to explore Textual than anything else. Even then, it would be pretty trivial
to update to something better for holding the data.</p>
<p>If this seems like your thing (and I will be supporting it and onward
developing it) you <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oidia/">can find it over on
PyPi</a>, which means it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or the ever-handy <code>pipx</code>:</p>

      <div><h1>An update</h1>
<p>So, it's fast approaching 2 months now <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">since I started the new
thing</a> and it's been a busy
time. I've had to adjust to a quite a few new things, not least of which has
been a longer and more involved commute. I'm actually mostly enjoying it
too. While having to contend with busses isn't the <em>best</em> thing to be doing
with my day, I do have a very fond spot for Edinburgh and it's nice to be in
there most days of the week.</p>
<p>Part of the fallout from the new job has been that, in the last couple of
weeks, I've thrown some more stuff up on PyPi. This comes about as part of a
bit of a dog-fooding campaign we're on at the moment (you can read some
background to this <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">over on the company
blog</a>).
While they have been, and will continue to be, mentioned on the Textualize
blog, I thought I'd give a brief mention of them here on my own blog too
given they are, essentially, personal projects.</p>
<h1>gridinfo</h1>
<p>This is one I'd like to tweak some more and improve on if possible. It is,
in essence, a Python-coded terminal tool that does more or less the same as
<a href="https://github.com/davep/slstats.el"><code>slstats.el</code></a>. It started out as <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1590476280457490434">a
rather silly quick
hack</a>, designed
to do something different with
<a href="https://github.com/darrenburns/rich-pixels"><code>rich-pixels</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here's the finished version (as of the time of writing) being put through
its paces:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzpGgVPD2aM" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gridinfo/">from here</a>, or install and
play with it with a quick <code>pipx install gridinfo</code>.</p>
<h1>unbored</h1>
<p>The next experiment with Textual was to write a terminal-based client for
the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">Bored-API</a>. My initial plan for this was to
just have a button or two that the user could mash on and they'd get an
activity suggestion dropped into the middle of the terminal; but really that
seemed a bit boring. Then I realised that it'd be a bit more silly and a bit
more fun if I did it as a sort of TODO app. Bored? Run it up and use one of
the activities you'd generated before. Don't like any of them? Ignore them
and generate some more! Feeling bad that you've got such a backlog of
reasons to not be bored? Delete a bunch!</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Here's a short video of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/unbored/">from here</a>, or install and play
with it with a quick <code>pipx install unbored</code>.</p>
<h1>textual-qrcode</h1>
<p>This one... this one I'm going to blame on the brain fog that followed flu
<em>and</em> Covid jabs that happened the day before (and which are still kicking
my arse 4 days later). Monday morning, at my desk, and I'm wondering what to
next write to experiment with Textual, and I realised it would be
interesting to write something that would show off that it's easy to make a
third party widget library.</p>
<p>And... yeah, I don't know why, but I remembered
<a href="https://github.com/davep/qrencode.el"><code>qrencode.el</code></a> and so
<code>textual-qrcode</code> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="The most useless Textal widget yet" src="/attachments/2022/12/01/textual-qrcode.png"></p>
<p>I think the most amusing part about this is that I did it in full knowledge
that it would be useless; the idea being it would be a daft way of showing
off how you could build a widget library as an add-on for Textual. But...
more than one person actually ended up saying "yeah hold up there this could
actually be handy!"</p>
<p>If you're one of those people... <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-qrcode/">you'll find it
here</a>.</p>
<h1>FivePyFive</h1>
<p>While I was on a roll putting stuff up on PyPi, I also decided to tweak up
my Textual-based 5x5 and throw that up too. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1554207518615814148">my first app built
with Textual</a>,
initially written before I'd even spoken to Will about the position here. At
one point I even did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual/blob/c4f60548922609133763c0e49f7b23aea5d44c2b/sandbox/davep/five_by_five.hy">a version in
Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>It's since gone on to become <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/tree/d2ba22b86f48f4ce5b0f55767efdcf1a5478b180/examples">one of the example apps in Textual
itself</a>
but I felt it deserved being made available to the world via an easy(ish)
install. So, if you fancy trying to crack the puzzle in your terminal, just
do a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>fivepyfive
</code></pre></div>

<p>and click away.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="343" height="610"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf34Z5r7Q60" title="FivePyFive -- A
little annoying puzzle for the terminal" frameborder="0"
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fivepyfive/">over here</a>.</p>
<h1>PISpy</h1>
<p>Finally... for this week anyway, is a tool I've called PISpy. It's designed
as a simple terminal client for looking up package information on PyPi. As
of right now it's pretty straightforward, but I'd like to add more to it
over time. Here's an example of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMGD6bXqIEo" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>One small wrinkle with publishing it to PyPi was the fact that, once I'd
chosen the name, I checked that it hadn't been used on PyPi (it hadn't) but
when it came to publishing the package it got rejected because the name was
too similar to another package! I don't know which, it wouldn't say, but
that was a problem. So in the end the published name ended up having to be
slightly different from the actual tool's name.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">over here</a> for the package, and
you can install it with a:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pispy-client
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then just run <code>pispy</code> in the terminal.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's been a fun couple of weeks coming up with stuff to help exercise
Textual, and there's more to come. Personally I've found the process really
helpful in that it's help me learn more about the framework and also figure
out my own approach to working with it. Each thing I've built so far has
been a small step in evolution on from what I did in the previous thing. I
doubt I've arrived at a plateau of understanding just yet.</p></div>

      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>On Twitter, a few weeks back, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsBexli/status/1577332548933500928">@itsBexli asked me how I go about setting up
Python for development on
macOS</a>. It's a
great question and one that seems to crop up in various places, and since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I
first got into using
macOS</a> and then
<a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">subsequently got back into coding lots in
Python</a> it's absolutely an issue I ran
into.</p>
<p>With my previous employer, while I was the only developer, I wasn't the only
person writing code and more than one other person had this issue so I
eventually wrote up my approach to solving this problem. That document is on
their internal GitLab, but I thought it worth me writing my personal
macOS/Python "rules" up again, just in case they're useful to anyone else.</p>
<p>I am, of course, not the first person to tackle this, to document this, to
write down a good approach to this. Before and after I settled on my
approach I'd seen other people write about this. So... this post isn't here
to try and replace those, it's simply to write down my own approach, so if
anyone asks again I can point them here. I feel it's important to stress:
this isn't the only way or thoughts on this issue, there are lots of others.
Do go read them too and then settle on an approach that works for you.</p>
<p>One other point to note, which may or may not make a difference (and may or
may not affect how this changes with time): for the past few years I've been
a heavy user of <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"><code>pipenv</code></a> to manage my
virtual environments. This is very likely to change from now on, but keep in
mind that what follows was arrived at from the perspective of a <code>pipenv</code>
user.</p>
<p>So... with that admin aside...</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>When I first got back into writing Python it was on macOS and, really early
on, I ran into all the usual issues: virtual environments breaking because
they were based on the system Python and it got updated, virtual
environments based on the Homebrew-installed Python and it got updated,
etc... Simply put, an occasional, annoying, non-show-stopping breaking of my
development environment which would distract me when I'd sat down to just
hack on some code, not do system admin!</p>
<h1>My Solution</h1>
<p>For me, what's worked for me without a problem over the past few years, in
short, is this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the system version of Python. Just don't.</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the Homebrew's own version of Python (I'm not even sure
   this is an issue any more; but it used to be).</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use a version of Python installed with Homebrew (or, more to
   the point, never install Python with Homebrew).</li>
<li>Manage everything with <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/"><code>pyenv</code></a>; which I do
   install from Homebrew.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Detail</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, what I'm writing here assumes that virtual
environments are being managed with <code>pipenv</code> (something I still do for
personal projects, for now, but this may change soon). Your choices and
mileage may vary, etc... This is what works well for me.</p>
<h2>The "one time" items</h2>
<p>These are the items that need initially installing into a new macOS machine:</p>
<h3>Homebrew</h3>
<p>Unless it comes from the Mac App Store, I try and install everything via
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. It's really handy for keeping track of what
I've got installed, for recreating a development environment in general, and
for keeping things up to date.</p>
<h3>pyenv</h3>
<p>With Homebrew installed the next step for me is to install <code>pyenv</code>. Doing so
is as easy as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pyenv
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once installed, if it's not done it for you, you may need to make some
changes to your login profile. I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a>
so I have <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/efc77fd20c4bd2f36eb628730787924b6a56fcfd/conf.d/python.fish#L21-L25">these lines in my
setup</a>.
Simply put: it asks pyenv to set up my environment so my calls to Python go
via its setup.</p>
<p>Plenty of help on how to set up <code>pyenv</code> can be found <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation">in its
README</a>.</p>
<p>Once I've done this I tend to go on and install the Python versions I'm
likely to need. For me this tends to be the most recent "active" stable
versions (as of the time of writing, 3.7 through 3.10; although I need to
now start throwing 3.11 into the mix too).</p>
<p>I use this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--list
</code></pre></div>

<p>to see the available versions. If I want to see what's available for a
specific version I'll pipe through grep:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--list<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>fgrep<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;  3.9&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is handy if I want to check what the very latest release of a specific
version of Python is.</p>
<h3>The "Global" Python</h3>
<p>When I'm done with the above I then tend to use <code>pyenv</code> to set my "global"
Python. This is the version I want to get when I run <code>python</code> and I'm not
inside a virtual environment. Doing that is as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>global<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, you'd swap the version for whatever works for you.</p>
<h3>When Stuff Breaks</h3>
<p>It seems more rare these days, but on occasion I've had it such that some
update somewhere still causes my environment to break. Now though I find
that all it takes is a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>rehash
</code></pre></div>

<p>and everything is good again.</p>
<h2>Setting Up A Repo</h2>
<p>With all of the stuff above being mostly a one-off (or at least something I
do once when I set up a new machine -- which isn't often), the real "work"
here is when I set up a fresh repository when I start a new project. Really
it's no work at all. Again, as I've said before, I've tended to use <code>pipenv</code>
for my own work, and still do for personal stuff (but do want to change
that), mileage may vary here depending on tool.</p>
<p>When I start a new project I think about which Python version I want to be
working with, I ensure I have the latest version of it installed with
<code>pyenv</code>, and then ask <code>pipenv</code> to create a new virtual environment with
that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you do this, you should see <code>pipenv</code> pulling the version of Python from
the <code>pyenv</code> directories:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7

</code></pre></div>

<p>The key thing here is seeing that <code>pipenv</code> is pulling Python from
<code>~/.pyenv/versions/</code>. If it isn't there's a good chance you have a Python
earlier in your <code>PATH</code> than the <code>pyenv</code> one -- something you generally don't
want. It will work, but it's more likely to break at some point in the
future. That's the key thing I look for; if I see that I know things are
going to be okay.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since I adopted these personal rules and approaches (and really, calling
them "rules" is kind of grand -- there's almost nothing to this) I've found
I've had near-zero issues with the stability of my Python virtual
environments (and what issues I have run into tend to be trivial and of my
own doing).</p>
<p>As I said at the start: there are, of course, other approaches to this, but
this is mine and works well for me. Do feel free to comment with your own,
I'm always happy to learn about new ways!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">yesterday</a>, I'm
about to start working at <a href="https://www.textualize.io">Textualize</a>, and
building Open-source software is important to the company.
<a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan">Will</a> -- the CEO -- is all about building
in public. If you follow him on Twitter you'll notice that his Python coding
adventure tweets actually outnumber is cooking tweets!</p>
<p>As someone who has long been a supporter of and fan of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free
Software</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open-source
software</a>, and has made
some small contributions along the way, I've also always made a point of
<a href="https://github.com/davep/">building my own tools in public</a>. In most cases
they're things that are likely only helpful to me, but some are more
generally useful. The point being though: it's all there in case it's
helpfull to someone else.</p>
<p>Which means that, as much as possible, when I'm writing code, I write it as
if it's going to be visible in public and someone else is going to be
reading it. I try and make the code tidy. I try and comment it well. I try
(but don't always manage for personal projects) to fully document it. The
important thing here being that someone coming to the code fresh should be
able to follow what's going on.</p>
<p>Against that background, and having just gone through the process of handing
off almost 5 years of work to someone else as a left an employer, I got to
thinking: we should always "build in public", even if it's in private.</p>
<p>When I started with my previous employer, and even to the day I left, I was
the only software developer there. I worked with a team who wrote code, but
being software developers wasn't what they did. Bioinformaticians and
machine learning scientists have other things to be doing. But, as I wrote
my code, I wrote every line assuming they, or some other developer down the
line, would be reading it. Pretty much every line was written for an
audience I couldn't see and didn't fully know. This, as mentioned above,
meant trying to keep the code clean, ensuring it was commented in helpful
ways, ensuring the documentation was helpful, and so on.</p>
<p>But it wasn't just about the code. Any non-trivial system will have more to
it than code. We had an internal instance of GitLab and I tracked all of my
work on there. So, as I planned and worked on new features, or went on bug
hunts, I'd document the process in the issue tracker. As much as possible
I'd be really verbose about the process. Often I wouldn't just open an
issue, go work on it, and then mark it closed; as I worked through the issue
I'd add comment after comment under it, documenting my thinking, problems,
solutions, cite sources when looking something up, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The whole process was an act in having a conversation with current or future
team members if they ever needed to look; with future me (really, that
helped more than once -- we all have those "that the <em>hell</em> was I thinking?"
moments); with any developer(s) who took over from me in the future.</p>
<p>I did all this as if I was broadcasting it in public <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">on
Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/davep">on
GitHub</a>, etc. It was in private, of course, but I
approached it as if it was in public.</p>
<p>There were always three main reasons for this, I felt:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accountability. At any moment someone who I worked with could review what
   I was doing and why I was doing it; it was an invitation to anyone
   curious enough to talk with me about what I was building and how I was
   building it.</li>
<li>Continuity of support for unplanned reasons. Life happens, sometimes you
   may, unplanned, never be available at work again. I never wanted to leave
   my employer in a position where picking up from such an event was a
   nightmare.</li>
<li>Continuity of support for planned reasons. It was possible, and it became
   inevitable, that I'd move on to something else. If that was to happen I
   wanted to be sure that whoever picked up after me would be able to do so
   without too much effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end item 3 seemed to really pay off. When it came time for me to hand
over my work to someone else, as I left, the process was really smooth and
trouble-free. I was able to point the developer at all the documentation and
source code, at all the issues, and invite them to read through it all and
then come back to me with questions. In terms of time actually spent talking
about the main system I was handing over I'd say that 4 years of work was
handed over with just a few hours of actual talking about it.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if it really paid off, of course. If they get really
stuck they do have an open invitation to ping me a question or two; I care
enough about what I designed and built that I want it to carry on being
useful for some time to come. But... I like to think that all of that
building in public, in private, will ensure that this is an invitation that
never needs to be called on. I like to think that, if something isn't clear,
they'll be able to check the code, the documentation and the issue history
and get to where they need to go.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Just over five years ago I got a message from my then employer to say I was
going to be made redundant after 21 years working for them. After the 3
month notice period the final day came. Meanwhile, I found something new
that <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">looked terrifying but
interesting</a>. In the end it was less
terrifying and way more interesting than I imagined it would be. It was fun
too.</p>
<p>But... (there's always a but isn't there?)</p>
<p>In the four and change years I've been there the company got bought out, and
then the result of that got bought up. As I've mentioned before I'm
generally not a "big company" kind of person; in all my years I've found
that I'm happier working in a smaller place. After a couple of buyouts my
employer had gone from being 10s of people in size to 100s of people in size
(and technically 10s of 1,000s of people in size depending on how you look
at it).</p>
<p>This change in ownership and size meant the culture became... well, let's
just say not as friendly as you tend to enjoy when it's a smaller group of
folk. On top of that I was starting to notice that my efforts were making
less of an impact as things got bigger, and I started to feel like my
contributions weren't really relevant any more. There were some problematic
things happening too: undermining of efforts, removal of responsibilities
without consultation or communication, that sort of thing. Plus worse.
There's little point in going into the detail, but it's fair to say that
work wasn't as fun as it used to be.</p>
<p>That felt like a good time to start to look around. If work makes you feel
unhappy and you can look around... look around.</p>
<p>Thing is, I wasn't sure what to look for. I was in the comfortable position
of, unlike last time, not <em>needing</em> to find something, so I could take my
time at least. Over the course of the last year I've spoken to many
different companies and organisations, some big (yes, I know, I said I don't
like big places -- sometimes what's on offer deserves a fair hearing), some
small, but none of them quite said <em>"this feels like me"</em>. In some cases the
whole thing didn't have the right vibe, in others the industry either didn't
interest me, or felt uncomfortable given my personal values. In one
particular case a place looked interesting until I checked the CTO's socials
and OMG NO NO NO AVOID AVOID (that was a fun one).</p>
<p>Then I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan">Will McGugan</a> saying he was
hiring to expand <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>. This caught my
interest right away for two good reasons.</p>
<p>I can't remember how long I've been following Will on Twitter; I likely
stumbled on him as I got back into Python in 2018 and I also remember noting
that he was a Python hacker just up the road from me. We'd vaguely chatted
on Twitter, briefly, in that "Twitter acquaintance" way we all often do (I
remember <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1438887277623750661">one brief exchange about fungus on The
Meadows</a>), and
he'd seemed like a good sort. A small company run by a "good sort" kinda
person felt like a damn good reason.</p>
<p>The second reason was Textual itself. I'd been watching Will develop it, in
open, with great interest. I had (and still have) a plan to write a brand
new CHUI-based (okay fine TUI-based as the kids like to say these days!)
Norton Guide reader, all in Python, and Textual looked like the perfect
framework to do the UI in. The chance to be involved with it sounded
awesome.</p>
<p>Now, I said two reasons, but there's also a third I guess: Will's pitch for
applying to Textualize felt so damn accessible! I'm on the older end of the
age range of this industry; for much of my working life as a developer I've
worked in isolation from other developers; while I first touched Python in
the 90s, I've only been using it in anger since 2018 and still feel like
I've got a lot to learn. Despite all these things, and more, saying <em>"aye
Dave this is beyond you"</em> I felt comfortable dropping Will a line.</p>
<p>Which resulted in a chat.</p>
<p>Which resulted in some code tinkering and chatting.</p>
<p>Which resulted in...</p>
<p>Something new.</p>
<p>So, yeah, as of 2022-10-10 I'm on yet another new adventure. Time for me to
<em>really</em> work on my Python coding as I work with Will and the rest of the
team as part of Textualize.</p>
<p>Or, as I put it on Twitter a few days ago: <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1574121611413921792">I'm going to be a Python
impostor syndrome
speedrunner</a>!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's five years ago this month that I bought myself my first macOS (then OS
X) device. After many years of having a Windows machine as my daily driver,
which was also my work machine (I worked from home), I decided it was high
time that I returned to having a Unix-a-like system on my desk too. For a
decade or so, starting in the later-90s, I'd had a GNU/Linux desktop. I
still had a Windows desktop (until a couple of years ago most of my work was
on DOS and Windows), but thanks to the wonders of a KVM, and later an X
server that ran on Windows, my personal hacking was done on a GNU/Linux
desktop.</p>
<p>But as things moved around, priorities changed, as life moved on, the
GNU/Linux boxes got retired and never quite replaced. Eventually, in 2015, I
found myself with the means and desire to recover that sort of setup. Long
story short, after a lot of reading up and weighing up options I decided
that the best option for a desktop Unix was... an iMac!</p>
<p>I loved it. Sure, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">there were lots of little things on the surface that were
different or annoying or just plain not as cool as the Mac fans would tell
you</a>,
but under the hood I found what I needed: a Unix CLI with all the things I
knew well. And, of course, it ran GNU Emacs just fine; that was the really
important thing for me.</p>
<p>Pretty much right away I decided that it might be fun to learn the tools
necessary to develop native Mac apps, and perhaps even iOS apps. I
downloaded XCode, bought a book, and started working through it. Having got
that book, I decided it might be interesting to own an iOS device too. So,
sort of needing an MP3 player, and having no wish to get an iPhone, <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I got
myself an iPod
Touch</a>. So I
was all set to devour the Swift book, write some stuff for OS X, create an
iOS app or two, and... life happened. Stuff cropped up that distracted me
from taking that further and I never really returned to working through the
book.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now and that initial iMac and iPod purchase spiralled a wee
bit. Next after the iPod was an iPad Mini, when my Nexus 7 was starting to
show its age and it was obvious that Google wasn't going to produce any more
good Android tablets. Then, when I needed a very portable Unix-a-like
machine for trips between where I was living and Edinburgh, <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">I got myself a
MacBook Air</a>.
Since then the iPod Touch has been replaced once, as has the iPad Mini. I
now also own an iPad and a MacBook Pro. Unless Apple screw up and turn Macs
into something unusable for developers (there are rumours), I imagine I'll
be using Apple devices for some time to come now.</p>
<p>And then, last month, having finally got frustrated with where Google were
going with Android and the Pixel series, I jumped ship to the iPhone 11.</p>
<p>As of right now I'm in a situation where I'm all about the Apple ecosystem
regarding hardware and operating systems (including for my work machine),
all of which is there to support my heavy use of the Google ecosystem
(actually, the one bit of Google hardware I still lean on heavily is the
Google Home -- I have 3 around my home).</p>
<p>So... given all of that, I thought it was time to look at returning to
learning Swift, with a view to writing some native macOS and i(Pad)OS stuff.
I soon realised that the book I'd bought back in 2015 was rather out of
date. It covers Swift 1.2 -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Version_history">we're now up to
5.2</a>!
Given this, and given I've forgotten pretty much everything I'd read at the
time, I decided I should start again from scratch.</p>
<p>This weekend I've started reading my way though <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ios-13-programming/9781492074526/"><em>iOS Programming
Fundamentals with
Swift</em></a>.
While this obviously has an emphasis on iOS, I'm already finding that the
first part of the book is a really great introduction to the Swift language
in general. The pace seems just right, and the way topics are grouped makes
it easy enough for me to skip over what's obvious (I don't need to know what
objected-oriented programming is, and what the difference between a class
and an object is, etc) and read up on the detail of this particular language
when it comes to general concepts I know (knowing the differences between a
class, struct and enum in the language is important, for example).</p>
<p>I've yet to write a line of code, but I'm fine with that. The book is
spending a lot of time introducing the language before encouraging you to
fire up XCode, and I'm okay with that. I'm never a fan of being asked to
write out code that I can't properly follow -- that just makes stuff look
like magic when it's far more educational to know what's going on. What I am
finding is I'm making lots of notes that are either <em>"oh, yeah, this is
cool, I like this idea!"</em> or <em>"WTF are you kidding me?!?"</em>. Which is really
nice -- it's always great to learn a new language that's a bit different
from what you normally use.</p>
<p>My plan then, over the next few weeks, it to keep at this and hopefully
document my journey. I think I'd like to write a short series of TIL-type
posts; nothing too long, just some new thing I read or discovered and my
reaction to it. So, if you happen to follow this blog, I apologise in
advance for any Swift-spam.</p>
<p>You have been warned. ;-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>By coincidence, in a couple of different places over the last couple of
weeks, the subject of <em>"how do I progress in leaning to program?"</em> has
cropped up. For me, I think the approaches and solutions tend to be the same
for when I want to get my head around a new language: read good examples of
idiomatic code, read other related materials, find a problem you care about
and implement a solution (ideally something you'll directly benefit from, or
at least others may benefit from). Hence the <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">5x5 puzzle and Norton Guide
reader projects I mentioned in my previous
post</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has problems that they need solving in a way that
would work for this approach. So another approach I've recommended in the
past is to go looking on somewhere like GitHub and find projects that
promote "low-hanging fruit" issues in a way that's designed to be friendly
for those who are new to development, new to contributing or new to the
problem domain.</p>
<p>While looking for examples of this yesterday I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners"><em>Awesome for
Beginners</em></a>. This looks
like a great list and one I'm going to keep <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep/">bookmarked for future
reference</a>. Now, this particular list does
seem to have an emphasis on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/issues/215">pulling in people who are new to contributing
to a project</a>
rather than new to development, but it does strike me as a good place to
start looking no matter where you're coming from.</p>
<p>I know I'm going to start having a wander around that list. It's always nice
to contribute and I feel there's real personal benefit in actively solving a
problem that someone else has and welcomes help with.</p></div>
