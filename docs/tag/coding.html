  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Last week I was wrestling with some Textual code, trying to get something to
lay out on the screen "just so". On the whole this isn't too tricky at all,
and for those times where it might feel tricky <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/how-to/design-a-layout/">there's some advice
available on how to go about
it</a>. But in this case
I was trying to do a couple of "on the edge" things and one thing I really
needed to know was what particular part of the display was being "caused" by
what container or widget<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment anyway, Textual doesn't have a full-blown devtools with
all the bells and whistles; not like in your average web browser. It does
have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/">a devtools</a>, but not
with all the fancy DOM-diving stuff the above would have needed.</p>
<p>What I needed was the equivalent of <code>print</code>-debugging but with a
point-and-ask interface. Now, I actually <em>do</em> often do <code>print</code>-debugging
with Textual apps only I use
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.notify"><code>notify</code></a>;
this time though <code>notify</code> wasn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>I needed something that would let me point at a widget and say <em>"show me
stuff about this"</em>. Something that happens when the mouse hovers over a
widget. Something like... <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#tooltips">a
tooltip</a>!</p>
<p>So that was easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">widget</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span><span class="p">)]:</span>
        <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tooltip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="si">!r}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ancestors_with_self</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Suddenly I could hover my mouse over a bit of space on the screen and get a
"traceback" of sorts for what "caused" it.</p>
<p>I posted this little hack to <code>#show-and-tell</code> on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Discord
server</a> and someone mentioned it would be
handy if it also showed the CSS for the widget too. That was simple enough
because every widget has a <code>styles.css</code> property that is the CSS for the
widget, as a string.</p>
<p>After that I didn't think much more about it; until today.</p>
<p>Looking back, one thing I realised is that adding the CSS information
<code>on_mount</code> wasn't quite good enough, as it would only show me the state of
CSS when the mount happened, not at the moment I inspect the widget. I
needed the tooltip to be dynamic.</p>
<p>Thing is... Textual tooltips can't be functions (which would be the obvious
approach to make it dynamic); so there was no way to get this on-the-fly
behaviour I wanted.</p>
<p>Except there was! The type of
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/widget/#textual.widget.Widget.tooltip"><code>tooltip</code></a>
is <code>RenderableType</code>. So that means I could assign it an object that is a
Rich renderable; that in turn means I could write a <code>__rich__</code> method for a
class that wraps a widget and then reports back what it can see every time
it's called.</p>
<p>In other words, via one step of indirection, I could get the <em>"call a
function each time"</em> approach I was after!</p>
<p>It works a treat too.</p>
<p>All of which is a long-winded way of saying I now have a <code>print</code>-debug-level
DOM inspector tool for when I'm building applications with Textual:</p>
<p><img alt="textual-dominfo in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/15/textual-dominfo.png#centre"></p>
<p>If this sounds handy to you, you can grab the code too. Install it into your
development environment with <code>pip</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-dominfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then attach it to your app or screen or some top-level widget you're
interested in via <code>on_mount</code>; for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">textual_dominfo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">DOMInfo</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">DOMInfo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">attach_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then hover away with that mouse cursor and inspect all the things!
Whatever you do though, <em>don't</em> make it part of your runtime, and don't keep
it installed; just make it a development dependency.</p>
<p>The source can be found <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-dominfo">over on
GitHub</a> and the package is, as
mentioned above, <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-dominfo">over on PyPi</a>.</p>

      <div><p>The idea for this one popped into my head while on the bus back from Textual
Towers this evening. So after dinner and some nonsense on TV I had to visit
my desk and do a quick hack.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown"><code>textual-countdown</code></a>, a
subtle but I think useful countdown widget for Textual applications.</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Countdown in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/11/textual-countdown.gif"></p>
<p>The idea is that you compose it somewhere into your screen, and when you
start the countdown the bar highlights and then starts to shrink down to
"nothing" in the middle of its display. When the countdown ends a message is
posted so you can then perform the task that was being waited for in an
event handler.</p>
<p>Not really a novel thing, I've seen this kind of thing before on the web;
I'm sure we all have. I just thought it would be a fun idea for Textual
applications too.</p>
<p>I envisage using this where, perhaps, an application needs to wait for an
API-visiting cooldown period, or perhaps as a subtle countdown for a
question in a quiz; something like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like it's something useful for your Textual
applications, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-countdown/">it's now available from
PyPi</a> and, of course, the
source is over <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown">on GitHub</a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview"><code>textual-astare</code></a> is another
Textual-based Python project that I've developed in the last year and I
don't believe I've mentioned on this blog. Simply put, it's a took for
viewing the abstract syntax tree of Python code, in the terminal.</p>
<p><img alt="astare in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/10/astare.png#centre"></p>
<p>I've just made a small update to it this evening after someone asked <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions/12">for a
sensible change I've been meaning to do for a
while</a>. When I
first read the request I <em>was</em> going to look at it next week, when I have
some time off work, but you know how it is when you sit at your desk and
have a "quick look".</p>
<p>So anyway, yeah, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-astview/">v0.8.0</a> is out
there and can be installed, with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a></li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.39.0"><code>textual</code></a></li>
<li>Made it so you can open a directory to browser from the command line.</li>
<li>Made opening the current working directory the default.</li>
<li>Tweaked the way dark/light mode get toggled so that it's now
  command-palette-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the code does need a wee bit of tidying -- this was one of my
earliest apps built with Textual and my approach to writing Textual apps has
changed a fair bit this year, and Textual itself has grown and improved in
that time -- but it's still working well for now.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I don't think I've mentioned it before on this blog, but some time back I
decided it would be fun to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> to
write a Mandelbrot explorer (simple Mandelbrot explorers have been another
one of my favourite <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">known problem to try an unknown
thing</a> problems). Doing it in the
terminal seemed like a fun little hack. I started off with creating
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas"><code>textual-canvas</code></a> and then built
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot"><code>textual-mandelbrot</code></a> on top
of that.</p>
<p>Not too long back <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/15/textual-0370-adds-a-command-palette/">I added a "command palette" to
Textual</a>
(I'd prefer to call it a minibuffer, but I get that that's not fashionable
these days), but so far I've not used it in any of my own projects; earlier
today I thought it could be fun to add it to <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mandelbrot commands in action" src="/attachments/2023/09/29/mandelbrot-commands.png#centre"></p>
<p>Most of the commands I've added are trivial and really better covered by
(and are covered by) keystrokes, but it was a good test and a way to show
off how to create a command provider.</p>
<p>Having started this I can see some more useful things to add: for example it
might be interesting to add a facility where you can bookmark a specific
location, zoom level, iteration value, etc, and revisit later. The command
palette would feel like a great way to pull back those bookmarks.</p>
<p>What I really liked though was how <em>easy</em> this was to do. <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot/blob/main/textual_mandelbrot/commands.py">The code to make
the commands
available</a>
is pretty trivial and, I believe, easy to follow. Although I do say so
myself I think I managed to design a very accessible API for this.</p>
<p>There's more I'd like to add to that (the Textual command palette itself, I
mean), of course; this was just the start. Support for commands that accept
and prompt for arguments would be a neat and obvious enhancement (especially
if done in a way that's reminiscent of how commands could be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager">CLIM</a> -- I
remember <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-cldict/">really liking</a> how you
could create self-documenting and self-completing commands in that).</p>
<p>All in good time...</p></div>

      <div><p>Since <a href="/2023/09/01/textual-query-sandbox.html">quickly hacking together <code>textual-query-sandbox</code> a few days
back</a>, I've made a bunch of small
changes here and there. While most have been cosmetic and playing with some
ideas, some have also been internal improvements that should make the tool
work better.</p>
<p>The most prominent change is one I pondered in the previous post, where I
thought it might be interesting to have a small collection of playgrounds
grounded together with a <code>TabbedContent</code>. So as of now the tool still has
the original playground which had an emphasis on nested containers:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 1" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-1.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's now a playground with an emphasis on selecting widgets within
containers<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 2" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-2.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's also now a playground that has an emphasis on pulling out widgets
based on ID and classes:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 3" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-3.png#centre"></p>
<p>The other change you will notice from the original post is the DOM tree
shown in the bottom right corner. Note that that isn't there to show your
query result (that's the bottom left panel), it's there to help picture how
the DOM in the current playground hangs together, and will hopefully help in
picturing the structure for when you write a query.</p>
<p>I sense there's still a lot of fun things I could add to this, and I'm still
keen on the idea of having the playgrounds "soft coded" in some way, so
people can make their own and load them up.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to try and work on is making the display as useful as
possible. While I think it's actually pretty neat and clear, there's not a
<em>lot</em> of space<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> available to show the playground and the results. Finding
a good balance is an interesting problem.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons this is turning into a really enjoyable tinker
project.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This is, of course, slightly nonsensical wording. Containers <em>are</em>
widgets in Textual. Pretty much everything you see in your terminal is a
widget, even a <code>Screen</code> is a widget.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>A lot of this of course hinges on how big someone's terminal is. I
tend to run a fairly high resolutions with the smallest font I find
readable so my terminal windows are often pretty "big"; other people
tend to have something much smaller in terms of cell with/height.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Sometimes I can have an idea for a Textual widget, library or application on
my ideas list for weeks, months even, before I get around to it -- mostly
just due to not having the clear time to make a run at getting it going --
and then other times an idea can pop into my head and it <em>has</em> to be created
there and then. <strong>Has</strong> to be!</p>
<p>This happened yesterday evening.</p>
<p>While the tool I built is something I'd thought of before (back around
November last year I think) it hadn't even made it to my <em>"list of stuff I
should make"</em> that I keep in Apple Reminders; not sure why really. But then
yesterday evening a question cropped up on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Textual Discord
server</a> that related to the subject and I was
reminded of it.</p>
<p>The subject being: <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/">Textual DOM
queries</a>. I like to think that
DOM queries in Textual are pretty easy to do, and well-explained in the
docs, but it's fair to admit that they need a bit of practice first, just
like any powerful tool. So I was reminded that I'd wanted to write a sandbox
application, that would have a practice DOM inside it, an input field to
type in a query, and a way of displaying the results.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-query-sandbox"><code>textual-query-sandbox</code></a>
was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Query Sandbox" src="/attachments/2023/09/01/tqs.png#centre"></p>
<p>In this very first version (which was <em>really</em> quickly put together -- it
was something like 15 minutes to write the main code and then probably 45
minutes tweaking styles, adding all the admin stuff to allow <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-query-sandbox/">deployment to
PyPi</a> and writing the
README) there's an <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/input/"><code>Input</code></a>,
a display of a group of nested containers with different IDs and classes,
and then a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/pretty/"><code>Pretty</code></a> widget
at the bottom to show the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/#query-objects"><code>query</code></a>
result.</p>
<p>If you think this looks like it might be useful to you, it can be installed
using either <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-query-sandbox
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then you can run it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>tqs
</code></pre></div>

<p>At which point load up the Textual query docs, type queries into the input
field, hit enter and see what gets highlighted and which widgets end up in
the result set at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Like I say: this was a quick hack yesterday evening, I think there's a lot
more can go into this. For one thing I think a more interesting practice DOM
would be a good idea, with a good mix of widgets; another thing could be
having a collection of different DOM playgrounds that can be switched
between (a <code>TabbedContent</code> of different playgrounds could be fun here); this
could even be taken further such that the user can create their own
playground DOM to practice against.</p>
<p>Eventually it would be neat if this could be turned into a library that can
be included in a Textual application, as a development-time debug tool, so
that on-the-fly test queries can be made.</p>
<p>For now though, it's started, it's under way, and I think the current
version probably covers 90% of the use cases for something like this; making
for a really quick and easy tool to double-check how to query something.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">Late on last year</a> I wrote about a
bunch of new things that I'd added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an
early <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">dog-fooding session we had at textual
HQ</a>.
Since then I've been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to
date with Textual.</p>
<p><img alt="Unbored" src="/attachments/2023/08/13/unbored.png#centre"></p>
<p>As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework,
but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there's still new ways of
doing things being designed so there's going to be the odd break in approach
now and again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/unbored">Unbored</a>, my kind of silly
self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x
for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with
0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple
of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn't crashing.</p>
<p>The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of
containers (they didn't used to receive focus by default, now they do so I
had to tell them not to again), and that was about it.</p>
<p>While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZsXGQQpFw">nifty little slide-in error dialog I'd
made</a>, and instead embraced
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/07/17/textual-0300-adds-desktop-style-notifications/">the new Textual notification
system</a>.</p>
<p>While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no <em>real</em> use to
anyone, I feel it's a pretty good barometer application, helping me check
what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual
application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual
dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested
way; for this though it's less crucial and is a good test of the state of
the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it'll be
helpful to me if it <em>does</em> break and they yell.</p></div>

<p>Given that for a good chunk of this year I've been a bit lax about writing
here, there's a couple or so coding projects I've not written about (well,
not on <em>here</em> anyway -- I have spoken lots about them <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep">over on
Fosstodon</a>). One such project is
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-canvas/"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>.</p>
<p>As the name might suggest, it's a "canvas" for Textual applications, which
provides a pretty basic interface for drawing pixels, lines and circles --
and of course any other shape you are able to build up from those basics.</p>
<p>I've just <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/releases/tag/v0.2.0">released a quick
update</a> after
it was <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/discussions/1">requested that I add a <code>clear</code> method to the <code>Canvas</code>
widget</a>; a request
that makes perfect sense.</p></div>

      <div><p>Another little thing that's up on PyPi now, which is the final bit of
fallout from <a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">the Textual dogfooding
sessions</a>, is a little project I'm
calling OIDIA.</p>
<p>The application is a streak tracker. I'm quite the fan of streak trackers.
I've used a few over the years, both to help keep me motivated and honest,
and also to help me track that I've avoided unhelpful things too. Now, most
of the apps I've used, and use now, tend to have reminders and counts and
stats and are all about "DO NOT BREAK THE STREAK OR ELSE" and that's mostly
fine, but...</p>
<p>To keep things simple and to purely concentrate on how to build Textual
apps, I made this a "non-judgement" streak tracker. It's designed to be
really simple: you add a streak, you bump up/down the number of times you
did (or didn't do) the thing related to that streak, for each day, and
that's it.</p>
<p>No totals. No stats. No reminders and bugging. No judgement.</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kz8eUzO9-8"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>When I started it, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to store the data.
Throwing it in a SQLite database held some appeal, but that also felt like a
lot of faff for something so simple. Also, I wanted to make the data as easy
to get at, to use elsewhere, and to hack on, as possible. So in the end I
went with a simple JSON file.</p>
<p>On macOS and GNU/Linux <code>streaks.json</code> lives in <code>~/.local/share/oidia</code>, on
Windows it'll be in... I'm not sure off the top of my head actually; it'll
be in whatever directory <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xdg/">the handy <code>xdg</code>
library</a> has chosen. and because it's JSON
that means that something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="OIDIA in action" src="/attachments/2022/12/16/oidia.png"></p>
<p>ends up looking like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how well that actually scales; possibly not
so well over a long period of time, but this was written more as another way
to explore Textual than anything else. Even then, it would be pretty trivial
to update to something better for holding the data.</p>
<p>If this seems like your thing (and I will be supporting it and onward
developing it) you <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oidia/">can find it over on
PyPi</a>, which means it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or the ever-handy <code>pipx</code>:</p>

      <div><h1>An update</h1>
<p>So, it's fast approaching 2 months now <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">since I started the new
thing</a> and it's been a busy
time. I've had to adjust to a quite a few new things, not least of which has
been a longer and more involved commute. I'm actually mostly enjoying it
too. While having to contend with busses isn't the <em>best</em> thing to be doing
with my day, I do have a very fond spot for Edinburgh and it's nice to be in
there most days of the week.</p>
<p>Part of the fallout from the new job has been that, in the last couple of
weeks, I've thrown some more stuff up on PyPi. This comes about as part of a
bit of a dog-fooding campaign we're on at the moment (you can read some
background to this <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">over on the company
blog</a>).
While they have been, and will continue to be, mentioned on the Textualize
blog, I thought I'd give a brief mention of them here on my own blog too
given they are, essentially, personal projects.</p>
<h1>gridinfo</h1>
<p>This is one I'd like to tweak some more and improve on if possible. It is,
in essence, a Python-coded terminal tool that does more or less the same as
<a href="https://github.com/davep/slstats.el"><code>slstats.el</code></a>. It started out as <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1590476280457490434">a
rather silly quick
hack</a>, designed
to do something different with
<a href="https://github.com/darrenburns/rich-pixels"><code>rich-pixels</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here's the finished version (as of the time of writing) being put through
its paces:</p>

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gridinfo/">from here</a>, or install and
play with it with a quick <code>pipx install gridinfo</code>.</p>
<h1>unbored</h1>
<p>The next experiment with Textual was to write a terminal-based client for
the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">Bored-API</a>. My initial plan for this was to
just have a button or two that the user could mash on and they'd get an
activity suggestion dropped into the middle of the terminal; but really that
seemed a bit boring. Then I realised that it'd be a bit more silly and a bit
more fun if I did it as a sort of TODO app. Bored? Run it up and use one of
the activities you'd generated before. Don't like any of them? Ignore them
and generate some more! Feeling bad that you've got such a backlog of
reasons to not be bored? Delete a bunch!</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Here's a short video of it in action:</p>

</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/unbored/">from here</a>, or install and play
with it with a quick <code>pipx install unbored</code>.</p>
<h1>textual-qrcode</h1>
<p>This one... this one I'm going to blame on the brain fog that followed flu
<em>and</em> Covid jabs that happened the day before (and which are still kicking
my arse 4 days later). Monday morning, at my desk, and I'm wondering what to
next write to experiment with Textual, and I realised it would be
interesting to write something that would show off that it's easy to make a
third party widget library.</p>
<p>And... yeah, I don't know why, but I remembered
<a href="https://github.com/davep/qrencode.el"><code>qrencode.el</code></a> and so
<code>textual-qrcode</code> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="The most useless Textal widget yet" src="/attachments/2022/12/01/textual-qrcode.png"></p>
<p>I think the most amusing part about this is that I did it in full knowledge
that it would be useless; the idea being it would be a daft way of showing
off how you could build a widget library as an add-on for Textual. But...
more than one person actually ended up saying "yeah hold up there this could
actually be handy!"</p>
<p>If you're one of those people... <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-qrcode/">you'll find it
here</a>.</p>
<h1>FivePyFive</h1>
<p>While I was on a roll putting stuff up on PyPi, I also decided to tweak up
my Textual-based 5x5 and throw that up too. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1554207518615814148">my first app built
with Textual</a>,
initially written before I'd even spoken to Will about the position here. At
one point I even did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual/blob/c4f60548922609133763c0e49f7b23aea5d44c2b/sandbox/davep/five_by_five.hy">a version in
Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>It's since gone on to become <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/tree/d2ba22b86f48f4ce5b0f55767efdcf1a5478b180/examples">one of the example apps in Textual
itself</a>
but I felt it deserved being made available to the world via an easy(ish)
install. So, if you fancy trying to crack the puzzle in your terminal, just
do a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>fivepyfive
</code></pre></div>

<p>and click away.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="343" height="610"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf34Z5r7Q60" title="FivePyFive -- A
little annoying puzzle for the terminal" frameborder="0"
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fivepyfive/">over here</a>.</p>
<h1>PISpy</h1>
<p>Finally... for this week anyway, is a tool I've called PISpy. It's designed
as a simple terminal client for looking up package information on PyPi. As
of right now it's pretty straightforward, but I'd like to add more to it
over time. Here's an example of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMGD6bXqIEo" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>One small wrinkle with publishing it to PyPi was the fact that, once I'd
chosen the name, I checked that it hadn't been used on PyPi (it hadn't) but
when it came to publishing the package it got rejected because the name was
too similar to another package! I don't know which, it wouldn't say, but
that was a problem. So in the end the published name ended up having to be
slightly different from the actual tool's name.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">over here</a> for the package, and
you can install it with a:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pispy-client
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then just run <code>pispy</code> in the terminal.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's been a fun couple of weeks coming up with stuff to help exercise
Textual, and there's more to come. Personally I've found the process really
helpful in that it's help me learn more about the framework and also figure
out my own approach to working with it. Each thing I've built so far has
been a small step in evolution on from what I did in the previous thing. I
doubt I've arrived at a plateau of understanding just yet.</p></div>
