  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier this week something in my development environment, relating to
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, Python,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> and
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">pipenv</a>, got updated and broke a handful
of repositories. Not in a way that I couldn't recover from, just in a way
that was annoying, got in the way of my workflow, and needed attention.
<em>(note to self: how I set up for Python/Django development on a machine
might be a good post in the future)</em></p>
<p>Once I was sure what the fix was (pretty much: nuke the virtual environment
and recreate it with <code>pipenv</code>, being very explicit about the version of
Python to use) the next step was to figure out how many repositories were
affected; not all were and there wasn't an obvious pattern to it. What was
obvious was that the problem came down to <code>python</code> in the <code>.venv</code> directory
pointing to a binary that didn't exist any more.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png" src="/attachments/2020/07/10/Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png"></p>
<p>So... tracking down problematic repositories would be simple enough, just
look for every instance of <code>.venv/bin/python</code> and be sure it points to
something rather than nothing; if it points to nothing I need to remake the
virtual environment.</p>
<p>I quickly knocked up a script that was based around looking over the results
of a <code>find</code>, and initially decided to use <code>file</code> to perform the test on
<code>python</code>. It seemed to make sense, as I wrote the script I checked the <code>man</code>
page for <code>file(1)</code> on macOS and sure enough, this exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-E On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that <code>file</code> dereferences links by default, that should get me an error
for a broken link, right? Bit hacky I guess, but it was the first thing that
came to mind for a quick bit of scripting and would do the trick. Only...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>-E<span class="w"> </span>does-not-exist

</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Wat</a>?!? But it's right there! It says so in the manual! <code>-E</code> is documented right in the manual page! And yet it's not in the valid switch list as put out by the command, <em>and</em> it's an <code>invalid option</code>. The hell?</p>
<p>So I go back and look at the <code>man</code> page again and then I notice it isn't in
the list of switches in the synopsis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br>
    file [-bcdDhiIkLnNprsvz] [--extension] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] [-P name=value] [-M magicfiles] file<br>
    file -C [-m magicfiles]<br>
    file [--help]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then did the obvious tests. Did I have <code>file</code> aliased in some way? No. Was
some other thing that works and acts like <code>file</code> in my path? No. Was I
absolutely 100% using <code>/usr/bin/file</code>? Yes.</p>
<p>Long story short: it seems the <code>man</code> page for <code>file</code>, on macOS, fibs about
what switches it supports; it says that <code>-E</code> is a valid option, but it's not
there.</p>
<p>What's even odder is the man page says it documents v5.04 of the command,
but <code>--version</code> reports v5.37. Meanwhile, if I check on a GNU/Linux box I
have access to, it does support <code>-E</code>, reports it in the switches, documents
it in the <code>man</code> page (in both the synopsis and in the main body of the page)
and it is v5.25 (and so is its man page).</p>
<p>So that was something like 20 minutes lost to a very small problem, for
which there was no real solution, but was time that had to be spent to get
to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>In the end I went with what I probably should have gone with in the first
place: <code>stat -L</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>venv<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-name<span class="w"> </span>.venv<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span>!<span class="w"> </span>stat<span class="w"> </span>-L<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$venv</span><span class="s2">/bin/python&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>/dev/null<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span>&gt;<span class="p">&amp;</span><span class="m">1</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">then</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="k">$(</span>dirname<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$venv</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now I have that script in my <code>~/bin</code> directory, ready for the next time
Homebrew and friends conspire to throw my day off for a while.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier on today I needed a copy of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"><code>wget</code></a> on my iMac. It's not "native" to
it so I got to wondering how you go about getting something like that onto it.
Sure, I could have just grabbed the source and built myself, but really it's
a lot nicer to use some sort of package manager.</p>
<p>A quick search lead me to <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and I was then up and
running in no time.</p>
<p>This in turn got me to thinking about how it might be fun to get some of the
software I used to use on my GNU/Linux machine up and running again. The first
one that came to mind was <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/"><code>slrn</code></a>. Sure enough
slrn is available via Homebrew and installing it was dead simple.</p>
<p>But then I was faced with a problem: I needed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">NNTP</a> server.
Way back I used to run a local one in my office that fed from and to my
ISP's. Back then my ISP was Demon Internet; these days I'm with BT. A quick
search lead me to an article or two that BT had a NNTP server, of sorts,
provided by a third party. So I did a quick check:</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Yay! This looked good.</p>
<p>After that I fired up <code>slrn</code> and.... problems. It kept asking me to log in,
to provide a user name and password. The only problem was that I'd read in more
than one place that a user name and password weren't needed for BT's server;
all that was required was you be on a BT IP address. Checking the slrn docs
I found <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-manual-6.html#ss6.32"><code>force_authentication</code></a>
but ensuring that was off made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point I removed <code>slrn</code> and gave up.</p>
<p>Later, thinking it might be an issue with just <code>slrn</code> and perhaps it was worth
trying a native NNTP client, I grabbed Unison
(<a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">which is no longer supported</a>
but seems to work fine). I got that set up and ran into the same issue: it
wanted login details.</p>
<p>Finally, after a bit more digging, I stumbled on the reason why I was struggling
to make any of this work: <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51205/?s_cid=con_FURL_giganews">BT had closed support for the server back in
December last year</a>!</p>
<p>A quick search around the web and I stumbled on <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org/">Eternal September</a>.
Given all I was interested in was the good old text groups this looked perfect.
I quickly registered an account, ran up Unison again and plugged in my details
and....</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.19.17.png"></p>
<p>Now that's all sorted I should try again with <code>slrn</code>. At which point I'll need
to drag out and tidy up <code>post.el</code> (<a href="http://post-mode.sourceforge.net/">the version that was being maintained
by some other people seems to have gone very stale</a>, sadly).</p></div>
