  <div>
      <div><p>I want to like Gboard. On paper it looks really rather good. It's a keyboard
from Google, it ties in with your account, it syncs things, it has clever
searching for emoji and gifs and the like... what's not to like?</p>
<p>Problem is, I've been a user of SwiftKey since around 2011 (I think it was).
I'm very used to how SwiftKey works and it also contains a lot of handy
things. I like that it has smart completion, that it learns how I type a bit
skewed and that it takes this into account, that I can turn off the fancy
swipe typing and instead make use of handy gestures like swipe-left to
delete a word. I like some of the themes a lot.</p>
<p>Into the mix comes my iPad, which I use on occasion. The standard Apple
keyboard is horrible and, sadly, I find SwiftKey on iOS just as frustrating.
It seems to lack enough key features there (especially the word deletion
gesture, as far as I can tell) that it's also a bit annoying. My dream of a
consistent typing experience across all devices just wasn't happening --
until I found Gboard on iOS.</p>
<p>That felt almost right. And from what I could tell it worked almost exactly
the same on iOS and Android. So it felt like a good time to try and force
myself to use Gboard on my Google Pixel and Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I'm just not getting on with it. It's okay. It's not bad.
It's just... not good. I'm finding that it lacks enough useful things that
it's a frustrating experience. Little things like: when I enter Google
Search, there's no word completion in the keyboard (SwiftKey has that); the
word deletion gesture (swipe left from the backspace key) seems very
hit-and-miss; the most obvious completion for a word sometimes appears in
the middle slot but, other times, in the left slot. And so on.</p>
<p>Nothing huge. Nothing that's a show-stopper. But a handful of a little
things that make me miss the comfortable home that is SwiftKey.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it does have some very handy and cleaver features too.
The searching for emoji -- including showing them up as word completions --
is rather clever. The gif-search thing is all kinds of fun too (mostly used
to annoy the hell out
of <a href="https://twitter.com/VolcanicArts">my son on twitter</a>).</p>
<p>None of those quite make up for the bits I miss from SwiftKey though.</p>
<p>All that said, I've being making a point of pushing on with Gboard, thinking
that most of my issues might just be because I'm too used to my "old home".
Mostly this was working well, until I noticed something this morning. While
reading the description for Gboard I noticed this handy thing in the "Pro
Tips" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sync your learned words across devices to improve suggestions (enable in
Gboard Settings→ Dictionary → Sync learned words).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful! I'd assumed that this was the case anyway -- it's Google after all
-- but it's good to know I can ensure it's turned on. So I went to turn it
on. This is what I found:</p>
<p><img alt="Gboard WTF" src="/attachments/2017/03/13/Screenshot_20170313-072359.png"></p>
<p>What the hell Google? Sure, I do have a Gsuite account on my phone -- as in
various apps have access to a Gsuite account (Gmail, Drive, etc...) -- but
it's not the primary account on my phone and it's not the account I'd really
want to be doing the dictionary sync with anyway. If I've got dictionary
sync I want it tied to the keyboard no matter the app I'm in, and no matter
the account I'm using in that app. I want the keyboard to be tied to a
specific account when it comes to sync (just like SwiftKey does it).</p>
<p>This, I think, is a show-stopper for me.</p>
<p>I can overlook the other niggles, I can learn to cope with it not being
quite so perfect in some situations; but the blanket inability to do
something as simple as cloud-sync the predictions and learn from how I type
-- things that are, these days, central to what Google's about -- it's
frankly stupid.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going to have to keep Gboard as a backup keyboard for those
times when I need to find the perfect gif.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the past couple or so weeks I've been having some issues with Google
Now. It first seemed to start on my Nexus 7, then appeared on my Nexus 6.
More recently, even as of today, I've seen it on
my <a href="/2017/03/08/hello_google_pixel.html">Google Pixel</a>. The problem is that,
in the Google Now launcher (or on the Pixel, in the Pixel launcher), the
Google Now page (that you swipe to the left for) sits empty for ages. All I
see is the little animated waiting circle and nothing else. Once or twice
I've had the Google app die and restart or, more often than not, after quite
some time it finally loads up.</p>
<p>The latter happened a little earlier and I noticed something I'd not seen
before:</p>
<p><img alt="Blank Google Now" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-115910.jpg"></p>
<p>What's with that "Achievements" menu option? You'll notice that the whole of
the menu is blank -- no profile picture or anything and none of the menu
options seemed to work.</p>
<p>Eventually, after I'd left it for a while, it ended up working.</p>
<p><img alt="Google Now finally working" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-120052.jpg"></p>
<p>And, once this happened, no "Achievements" option.</p>
<p>Presumably this is some back-end server issue, I'm being served up something
I'm not supposed to be seeing and it's confusing the client app. Okay, I
don't <em>know</em> that's the case, but it has that sort of feel.</p>
<p>So now I need to go looking for what this Achievements thing is all about.</p>
<p>Using Google, obviously.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>For the past two years I've, mostly, being happily using a Google Nexus 6 as
my phone. In the past six months or so I've started to notice that it hasn't
been quite as good as it was. The main problem, for me, was that the camera
was starting to play out. The issues were the ones that I've seen reported
elsewhere: use of the camera would quickly make the phone laggy, very slow
response times on pressing the shutter, occasional failure to save an image,
etc. This was generally frustrating and, even more so, because <a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html">I'd got back
into photoblogging</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I've been lusting over the Google Pixel ever since it was
originally shown off. I was some way off my phone contract renewal and the
price of a new Pixel was something I just couldn't justify. Last week though
an offer cropped up that meant I could renew early <em>and</em> get a Pixel
(including a free Daydream headset thrown in).</p>
<p>Fast forward to Monday just gone and...</p>
<p><img alt="My new Pixel" src="/attachments/2017/03/08/IMG_20170308_120458.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm liking it rather a lot. It is odd that it's smaller in my hand
than the Nexus 6 was (the XL wasn't an available option <em>and</em> I was also
starting to think it was time to drop down in size a little again) but I'm
also finding it a little easier to work with; it's also nice that it fits in
trouser pockets as well as jacket pockets.</p>
<p>It feels very fast (although every Android phone and tablet I've ever had
have felt fast to start with) and smooth to use. I especially like the
default feedback vibration -- it's a lot smoother yet also more reassuring
than any I've felt before.</p>
<p>The Google Assistant is proving to be very handy. I'm sort of used to it
anyway thanks to having owned an Android Wear watch for a couple of years
but having it on the phone like this seems like a natural next step.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm getting very used to very quickly, and really liking a
lot, is fingerprint recognition. I didn't think I needed it but now I'm
wondering how I ever managed without it. Combined with the notification
pull-down gesture that the recognition area supports it seems like a perfect
way to open the get going with a phone.</p>
<p>There's a couple of niggles with it, of course. The main one for me is the
lack of wireless charging. That was something I really liked about the Nexus
6: I could be sat at my desk and have the phone sat on top of a charging
pad, staying topped up. No such handy setup with the Pixel. The other thing
is the lack of water resistance. To be fair: it's not something I've ever
really felt I <em>needed</em> with other phones and I'm not in the habit of
sticking them under water; but knowing that it doesn't matter too much if it
gets exposed to rain would be nice.</p>
<p>Other than that... there's not much else to say right now. It works and
works well, the move from the N6 to it was pretty smooth and the Pixel has
fallen perfectly into my normal routine.</p></div>

      <div><p>Now and again Google seem to actually listen. While they do generally have a
bad habit of removing things from things and saying it's for everyone's good
(because options are bad and they can't maintain them, apparently) it seems
they <em>can</em> do the odd turnaround now and again.</p>
<p>One thing they removed from Android recently was the
"<a href="/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html">until next alarm</a>""
option when putting a device in "do not disturb" mode.</p>
<p>Seems they've added that back in 6.0.1:</p>
<p><img alt="Google sees sense" src="/attachments/2015/12/17/Screenshot_20151217-112015.png"></p>
<p>It's a small thing, but it makes so much more sense and makes things so much
easier (even if it's a trivial thing).</p>
<p>Nice one Google. More of this please.</p></div>

      <div><p>I actually can't remember when the change was now, it was either Android 5.0
or one of the 5.x point releases, but I can recall the frustration of Google
having changed how you make an Android device silent, or not. The idea seemed
clever enough but it was a real pain to switch to and use. Previously there'd
simply been this neat system of setting he volume to either be some non-off
value, vibrate or totally silent. I even had a neat little widget on the home
screen of my phone to allow me to toggle between these 3 states.</p>
<p>It was simple, and worked well.</p>
<p>The new system though.... ugh. It was confusing and so much more long-winded
to work with.</p>
<p>At some point though they added one big redeeming feature: "Until next alarm".
When I got into bed I could tell my tablet to go totally silent until my
alarm went off in the morning, and then it would all work as normal. That was
an utterly brilliant idea.</p>
<p>So it made sense that if they changed anything about this in Marshmallow they'd
keep that in and make it even more awesome, right? Right?!?</p>
<p><img alt="Nope" src="/attachments/2015/11/12/Screenshot_20151112-140600.png"></p>
<p>Well fuck!</p>
<p>Why? Just..... why?!? I actually prefer how the new one works. They've more or
less solved the problem of how it was more faff to deal with, they've solved
the problem of having to cock about with the volume rocker to get at the
settings and then set the settings. I like all that.</p>
<p>But taking "Until next alarm" away? That's just nuts.</p>
<p>Sometimes I really get the impression that the Android developers are like the
Chrome OS developers: they're having a ton of fun improving and onward developing
the system but they have little connection to how people actually use this stuff.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's been quite a while since I used voiced search on my Nexus 6. Ever since
I got the Moto 360 I've not really had a need to say "OK Google" to my phone
because I could simply say it to my wrist. Today though, because I wanted to
quickly look something up and my phone was to hand, I spoke to it and got this:</p>
<p><img alt="Voice search fail" src="/attachments/2015/11/11/Screenshot_20151111-154157.png"></p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've been here before. I had <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/fP9kdADZPQ9">exactly this sort of problem with my Xperia Z
at one point</a>.
The problem appeared to go away eventually (actually, it sort of came and
went a few times over a matter of weeks, if I recall correctly), although I
never really got to the bottom of the cause.</p>
<p>I've tried rebooting the phone and that hasn't helped at all. While it's more
of a vague annoyance than anything else (like I say above, my Android Wear
device is my goto tool for talking to Google these days) it does frustrate a
little when fairly expensive tools don't "just work".</p></div>

      <div><p>Following on from
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/06/25/did-google-just-break-wear-timers.html">yesterday's problem with the Android Wear timer</a>
I think I now have a solution. It came up
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/RZujypG7EyF">while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue</a>.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I've seen a number of
times before with Google stuff. One thing that's rather common (in many cases
for very obvious reasons -- you can't cover the whole world in one go) with
Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This
felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared
to be unaffected by the issue (I'm guessing he's on the latest version of
Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that
became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out
he was the same as me: British English.</p>
<p>So much for that idea.</p>
<p>But then he suggested switching to US English and back again.</p>
<p>Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft "turn it off and on again" approach to
a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and
really do suffer the same issues) I switched to en-US on the phone and tried
setting a timer in voice on the watch.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>So then I switched back to en-GB on the phone and...</p>
<p><img alt="I appear to have timers working again" src="/attachments/2015/06/26/Timer Running on Watch.png"></p>
<p>...it still worked!</p>
<p>I've tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it's yet
to fail.</p>
<p>It would appear, as odd as it is, that this is the fix. Well, a fix.</p></div>

      <div><p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p></div>

      <div><p>For a long time now Chrome has been my web browser of choice. It has, to some
degree, become my "other emacs" (ignoring for a moment that my use of GNU
emacs has sort of lapsed the last few years). By that I mean that it's a
portable environment that serves me well on many operating systems and, for
one of my machines, actually <em>is</em> the operating system. I really appreciate how
Chrome's sync lets me feel right at home no matter which machine I'm on.</p>
<p>But I've run into one small issue that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>In some situations I find it pleasing, and I find it makes sense, that some
web "apps" open in a window of their own rather than in a Chrome tab. On Windows
and on ChromeOS this is simple enough, all I need to do is find the "app" in
the Chrome app launcher, pull up the content menu, and tell it to open as a
window.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on Windows 7" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextWin.png"></p>
<p>Nice and simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac, so well known for doing everything every other OS does but doing
it better and being easier to use.... you'd expect it's at least the same there,
right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on OS X" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextMac.png"></p>
<p>There's no option at all to open as a window!</p>
<p>So, on the Mac, while I'd love to be able to open Gmail as a window/app in its
own right, I'm totally out of luck, it seems. I've no idea whose "fault" this
is. It's not clear to me if this is a Chrome/Google decision or if it's about
how things have to work on a Mac. Thing is, I find it hard to believe that
it's the latter given that Google Keep runs in its own window on the Mac and
I can happily pin it to the dock.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It's that simple on ChromeOS too. In case you're wondering why I
didn't also illustrate that, it's because you can't take a screenshot on
ChromeOS while you've got a context menu open. O_o&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
