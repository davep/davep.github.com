      <div><p>It's been a wee while since I wrote anything here (been about a month) so I
thought I'd make mention of what's going on.</p>
<p>The main news is that I'm employed again!</p>
<p>Once <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">the news about the Textual layoffs
hit</a> I, of course, started the job
hunting process. This lasted for a wee while (and I have a couple of stories
about that -- perhaps I'll write them up one day). I officially became
"unemployed" on April the 1st (yeah, I know), and by the 23rd I had an offer
for a new position, which I accepted.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing I've been in that position for a touch over 3
weeks and it's going really well. Right at this moment I'm doing zero Python
work (that will change, I strongly suspect) and, actually, for the first
time ever, I'm writing some TypeScript (it's tempting me to dive into that
some more).</p>
<p>The team I'm working in are great and I'm also really impressed so far by
the practices they have in place relating to getting stuff done. It's
actually a refreshing change to work in a bigger organisation and actually
find it not massively frustrating!</p>
<p>I'm also back to working from home full time. This isn't that big a deal for
me as I spent around 22 years doing so <a href="2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">up until
2018</a>, and of course it isn't that big
of a deal to many folk these days anyway thanks to the 2020- period. This
prompted me to finally clear out the spare room (I've only been in here a
touch under 5 years so of course there were a lot of "I'll sort those soon"
boxes and stuff in there), buy a second desk, and make a work-coding area
that is away from totally separate from my for-fun-coding area.</p>
<p>This has turned out to be a <em>really</em> good decision. I love my main hacking
space in the living room, and have done a lot of work there, but that was
always on the odd days here and there when I'd work at home. Now that
working at home is a full-time role it felt important to make the
distinction.</p>
<p>Weirdly though, all of this means that I'm spending less time working on
personal stuff. When I was working at Textualize, most days, I'd be spending
the best part of 3 hours in the day getting to and from the office. I
thought that perhaps getting that time back would translate into having more
time to tinker with my own stuff. Actually what I'm finding I'm doing is I'm
spending the time on more general self-care and domestic things. This is a
good thing.</p>
<p>Doubtless once things really settle down and I form my new routine I'll dive
back into FOSS coding more again, and perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davep-codes">get back to streaming while I
code</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile though you <em>can</em> find me steaming many late evenings, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson/streams">mucking
about on my PS5</a>. Right at
this moment I'm finally playing all the way through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORBz0_ubHoJKT9xe3pvCTbRh">Just Cause
4</a>
(a game I bought back in 2019 and never finished). In fact last night I
finished the main story.</p>
<p>Expect a lot more PS5-based streaming nonsense over the next few months.</p>
<p>One other change I have made is to my VR video publishing schedule. For the
longest time I had the time and was playing so much that I published a video
every day. This wasn't a schedule I set myself, this was more a case of I
was playing so much that to publish less frequently would mean there would
be a huge backlog. These days I'm back to working 5 days a week (previously
I was working 4 days) so I have to cram a little more into my weekends, and
also I want to try and do other things during weekends too. So recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHko0fDZm7I">I
changed to an every-other-day
schedule</a>.</p>
<p>And, really, that's about it. For now expect to see a bit less Python-based
content on here, and also quite a bit less Textual-based stuff too.
Currently my focus is elsewhere and it also seems that Textual is a bit of a
moving target recently, throwing in some fun new bugs and breaking changes
which are tricky to keep on top of. That said, you <em>will</em> still find me in
the repo, lending a hand when I can, and of course in the Textual Discord
too; just don't expect to see me quite so omnipresent there, especially
during the work day.</p></div>

      <div><p><img alt="Death Stranding" src="/attachments/2024/02/05/IMG_4223.JPG#centre"></p>
<p>Death Stranding is easily one of my top 5 games ever. I bought the PS4
version, on a whim, back in early 2020, to see what all the fuss was about.
I didn't know much about it other than the love/hate it seemed to be
getting. I can still remember the first session, being a bit confused about
what was going on, and then suddenly hitting a perfect moment in the game
where I knew it was for me, and that I was going to love it.</p>
<p>That moment? It's when you're setting out for the incinerator, the camera
pulls back, the landscape opens up before you, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwoMJNxiFo"><em>Bones</em> by Low Roar
kicks in</a>. Perfection!</p>
<p>I went on to finish the story in around 45 to 50 hours (much of that
overlapping with the first week or so of lockdown during the pandemic); and
then played at least as much again just exploring, building zip lines,
roads, etc.</p>
<p>I even <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/">kept a photoblog of my time in the
game</a>.</p>
<p>About a year back I bought the Director's Cut of the game, this time for PC.
I'd decided that I had to play it through again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb7390_rldQ&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORDJd_VYhF74e6Mapf8oHp8i">and did start streaming
it</a>.
Annoyingly though the PC setup wasn't great. The game itself ran just fine
on my PC, but the controller setup meant that, as I sat on the sofa, it
would drop connection from time to time. The only workaround for this was to
sit on my office chair closer to the TV and, really, this wasn't
comfortable.</p>
<p>Eventually that play-through fell away.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLstJHlC4U">and the release of the 10 minute Death Stranding
2 trailer</a> and I was hooked all
over again! While it never totally went away, my obsession with this game
was back full force.</p>
<p>I had to play again!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, between the attempt to play through on the PC and now, I'd
acquired a PS5 <em>and</em> at some point I'd upgraded my PS4 version of Death
Stranding to the PS5 Director's Cut.</p>
<p>So I had to. I just had to. I'd had a great time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU">streaming my play through
the story of Cyberpunk
2077</a>
so it made sense to do the same with Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Last night I hit <em>New game</em> on my PS5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-irn7AcJ7g">and played for just over 2
hours</a>. This play through is
likely going to take a long time -- my work situation means I have a longer
and more tiring commute -- but I'm determined to do it. I want to experience
all of the extra things in the Director's Cut, including the extra story
(which I've read there is, but haven't seen or read about).</p>
<p>I hope, eventually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-irn7AcJ7g&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORCBUB0_pmQ5hKu1WTJnAVGI">the playlist I
started</a>
will have the full story plus lots more fun and building and exploring in
it. Hopefully I'll be done just in time for the release of DS2! (and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">GTA6</a>, it's going to be a busy
year for gaming next year!)</p></div>
