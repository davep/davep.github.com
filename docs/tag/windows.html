  <div>
      <div><p>I seem to have somehow messed up my left hand. I'm not sure what the problem is
yet, I'm speaking to the doctor and have had an x-ray to check out one possible
cause, but the simple fact is that my left hand has an issue. Sometimes the
arm is painful, pretty much all the time a couple of fingers are near-numb.
One unfortunate side-effect of this is that I'm finding typing rather
uncomfortable. Except, that is, when I'm typing in my
<a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">iMac</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the vast majority of the typing I do is on my Windows 7 desktop
machine I decided it was time to look at getting a new keyboard, one that
was as comfortable to type on as the Apple keyboard. Given that I really needed
to be in a position where I could actually try the keyboards out I headed
off to the local PC World.</p>
<p>Long story short: none of the Windows-oriented keyboards I tried did it for me.
None were as comfortable as the Mac keyboard. I tried a few a couple of times
and then suddenly had an idea... Apple do a full-size keyboard and, from what
I've seen in the past, it does work with Windows, after a fashion. So I went
to talk to the Apple guy, checked they had one in stock, handed over Â£40 and
headed home again.</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Keyboard" src="/attachments/2015/08/17/Apple-Keyboard.jpg"></p>
<p>Having now worked with it for a couple of days I think this might be one of
the best keyboard purchases I've ever made.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, of course. The keyboard isn't designed to work with Windows,
it's designed for the Mac. But for the most part I'm finding that it's not
confusing and I'm adapting just fine.</p>
<p>I had to go searching for an unofficial layout that I could install (one
that's actually old enough that it doesn't even say it supports Windows 7)
and installing that seems to have cured a few issues. The issues I do have
remaining are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the application I'm in, @ and " are swapped. Really, I'm not
kidding. In SublimeText @ and " are the right way round; in Skype they're the
wrong way round. I suspect that this might be down to the fact that I need
to restart applications so they take up the new mapping (a reboot of the machine
might be in order here).</li>
<li>The keyboard has no marked insert toggle key. There is one, it's the 0 on
the numeric keyboard if you have (also missing, but with a mapping) numlock
turned off.</li>
<li>Alt and Win are the wrong way round. The Cmd key acts as the Win key and it
is in the same position as Alt is normally in. I'm actually adapting to this
pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Apple hates the # key. Much like I have problems typing # on the iMac, the
same issue exists when typing on Windows too. Whereas on the iMac I have to
use Alt-3 to get a #, on the Windows machine I have to use Ctrl-Alt-3. Not
ideal but it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>They're the main issues I've discovered so far. It's possible that there are
other niggles waiting for me but, hopefully, there's workarounds for them too.
Mostly though I'm finding that the small adjustments I have to make to how I
work are worth it given just how comfortable this keyboard is to type on.</p>
<p>I really do wish there was a Windows-oriented keyboard that had the exact same
build quality.</p></div>

      <div><p>For a long time now Chrome has been my web browser of choice. It has, to some
degree, become my "other emacs" (ignoring for a moment that my use of GNU
emacs has sort of lapsed the last few years). By that I mean that it's a
portable environment that serves me well on many operating systems and, for
one of my machines, actually <em>is</em> the operating system. I really appreciate how
Chrome's sync lets me feel right at home no matter which machine I'm on.</p>
<p>But I've run into one small issue that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>In some situations I find it pleasing, and I find it makes sense, that some
web "apps" open in a window of their own rather than in a Chrome tab. On Windows
and on ChromeOS this is simple enough, all I need to do is find the "app" in
the Chrome app launcher, pull up the content menu, and tell it to open as a
window.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on Windows 7" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextWin.png"></p>
<p>Nice and simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac, so well known for doing everything every other OS does but doing
it better and being easier to use.... you'd expect it's at least the same there,
right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on OS X" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextMac.png"></p>
<p>There's no option at all to open as a window!</p>
<p>So, on the Mac, while I'd love to be able to open Gmail as a window/app in its
own right, I'm totally out of luck, it seems. I've no idea whose "fault" this
is. It's not clear to me if this is a Chrome/Google decision or if it's about
how things have to work on a Mac. Thing is, I find it hard to believe that
it's the latter given that Google Keep runs in its own window on the Mac and
I can happily pin it to the dock.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It's that simple on ChromeOS too. In case you're wondering why I
didn't also illustrate that, it's because you can't take a screenshot on
ChromeOS while you've got a context menu open. O_o&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
