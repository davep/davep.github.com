  <div>
      <div><p>So... erm... yeah... I did it again. I looked away for a moment and somehow
<a href="/2022/12/16/oidia.html">almost 7 months passed without a post</a>! It's so
easily done too isn't it? While, <a href="/2022/05/20/im-back.html">when I revived this blog last
year</a>, I didn't make a point of intending to write
lots and often, I had hope that I'd manage something at least once a week;
perhaps at least once a month.</p>
<p>Ahh well.</p>
<p>There's been two main reasons why it's been quiet around here. The first is
that <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">my (now not so) new job</a>
keeps me busy (in a good way). It involves a reasonable amount of trekking
into town and back (which I don't mind on the whole), and once I'm home in
the evening I'm generally (but not always) done with the keyboard and desk.</p>
<p>The second reason, which is probably the dafter one, is that a bit earlier
this year I finally upgraded my desktop setup from the 2019 Intel MacBook
Pro I was using to a recently-released M2Pro Mac Mini (and <em>what</em> an
upgrade!). How this plays into blogging being even more quiet is... I needed
to set up jekyll again, and I'd forgotten how I got it running in the first
place, so I kept putting off getting it going, and...</p>
<p>Well, this morning, I sat down with coffee, grepped the <code>history</code> on my
previous machine, and got it running in like 5 minutes (of course).</p>
<p>So, here I am, back adding another blog post. I'm writing this as much to
test that the setup works as anything else.</p>
<p>But also, this time, I'm going to try and make a promise to myself: I'm
going to try and write more. I can and should write about anything. I can
and should write short things as well as long things. I can and should
remember that it's not about writing things that are going to be super
important or anything like that, it's about just getting stuff down and
creating and recording.</p>
<p>Note of course I said "try" and make a promise.</p>
<p>We'll see. ;-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.</p>
<p>Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).</p>
<p>I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.</p>
<p>So I had to go and look.</p>
<p>Having looked I came away with one.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.</p>
<p>As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.</p>
<p>For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.</p>
<p>And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Almost a week ago (yes, I have being meaning to write something down about
this and have kept failing to do so) my iMac told me that there was a new
version of the OS waiting for me. While this is doubtless no big deal for
most Mac owners, this was interesting to me because it's the first time
I've experienced an OSX upgrade since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I got the iMac</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="El Capitan downloading" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.01.37.png"></p>
<p>The download took a while and, while the install had a couple of curious
bumps along the way, nothing seemed to actually go wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="About to get going" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.18.png"></p>
<p>The two main things I noticed were that it seemed to take the installer an
absolute age to close down all running apps before it got to doing the
installation. The other was that Mac progress bars seem to have a very odd
way of calculating things. Often it would tell me that there was (for example)
28 minutes to go, it'd stay like that for 20 minutes, then drop 5 minutes,
then appear to finish very soon after.</p>
<p><img alt="The final countdown" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Mostly though I just left it alone and let it do its own thing. While the whole
process took quite a while, it came back just fine (if I'm fair I'm not sure
it took much more time than when I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to
Windows 10).</p>
<p>The changes and improvements aren't really that obvious. I think I would say
that the machine feels a little quicker in places, but nothing I can really
put my finger on. One of the things I do like is the new split-screen facility
for full-screen apps. While I don't use the full-screen facility <em>that</em> much
I have found the need to split the screen before.</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements I've read about seem to involve things I'm
never going to use: either improvements to Safari (Chrome all the way for
me), the Mac Mail app (Gmail all the way for me, with <a href="http://www.kiwiforgmail.com/">Kiwi for Gmail</a>
being my client of choice on the iMac) or various iOS-oriented things which
are of little use (while <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I do own an iOS device</a> it's not one I use much).</p>
<p>Overall the thing I'm taking away from this is that the upgrade was smooth,
nothing was obviously broken or changed in a way that was confusing (unlike
some Windows or ChromeOS updates I've experienced in the past) and I didn't
have to do anything that required much in the way of knowledge to keep it
all going.</p>
<p>Doubtless that won't always be the case, such is the nature of OS upgrades.</p></div>

      <div><p>While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">my iMac</a>.</p>
<p>One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:</p>
<p><img alt="Support details of the iMac" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.14.png"></p>
<p>Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.23.png"></p>
<p>Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o</p>
<p>I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.30.55.png"></p>
<p>About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.</p>
<p>So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Last night, before heading for bed, I noticed that there was an update available
for OS X on the iMac, and also for iTunes. Despite the late hour I decided
to do the update anyway. OS X updated pretty smoothly (albeit with some rather
unhelpful progress bars that appear to give estimated times that have no
relation to reality), as did iTunes.</p>
<p>I was then told that there was an update for my iPod as well (all part of this
new thing where Apple have invented Spotify, obviously). I let that start doing
its thing and that's where things got odd. First it started the update and the
iPod appeared to insist that it wasn't plugged into the iMac, even though it
was. Then I gave it a second go (after unplugging it and plugging it in
again) and it all seemed to go through just fine, only...</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iPod?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Photo 01-07-2015 10 21 56.png"></p>
<p>...while the iPod was pretty sure it was now running iOS 8.4, iTunes on the iMac
had other ideas:</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.22.16.png"></p>
<p>The following morning iTunes kept insisting that it needed to do the update
so, even though the iPod was obviously up to date, I let it do it anyway. After
it'd gone through the update process again it still insisted that the iPod
was running 8.3 rather than 8.4. Until, that is, I unplgged it and plugged it
back in again.</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.26.20.png"></p>
<p>So now it all seems fine. I just had to do a variation on "have you tried
turning it off and on again?"</p>
<p>Once again I find myself running into things on a Mac that are very common
elsewhere, on other operating systems, and which Mac owners would often have
you believe weren't an issue.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>My history with computers starts with a Sinclair ZX81 in the early 1980s,
followed shortly by a Vic20, then on to the BBC B and fairly quickly on to
very early IBM PC compatible machines. In the early 1990s I added OS/2 (during
the introduction of Warp) and not too long after that GNU/Linux. Along the way
I've also used the odd Unix here and there as well as CP/M, RSTS and VMS.</p>
<p>Aside from an inherited Mac whose model name escapes me, and whose operating
system version also escapes me, I've never really had too much exposure to
the world of Apple.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back all of that changed.</p>
<p>It's quite a long time since I had a Unix of some form as a desktop machine
and I was starting to get the urge to have one again. During all of this time
I've had a GNU/Linux box or two available but for the past few years I've
always used them from the (dis)comfort of my Windows desktop. Generally that
was fine because the uses I had were not desktop.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short: I started out thinking that I wanted some form of
Unix on my desk again and, somehow, ended up walking out of a shop with
an iMac.</p>
<p>Given the above history I thought it might be fun to jot down my experiences
in the first couple of weeks. This will be a vaguely random wander through my
experiences. It's not a review. It's not even really intended as a judgement
of the machine and the operating system. It's nothing more than a collection
of notes of what I found and my reaction to what I found.</p>
<h1>The keyboard</h1>
<p>The first strong reaction I had to the machine was regarding the keyboard. I
thought I was going to hate it. I've had the misfortune of using various
chiclet keyboards over the years and I've hated every single one. I find that I
can't type on them, that it doesn't feel right, and that it makes my fingers
ache badly if I spend too much time using them. My history and experiences
has always been such that I've generally preferred very mechanical-feeling
keyboards.</p>
<p>This just wasn't the case with the iMac keyboard. I don't know why, I still
don't know why, but this feels like one of the most comfortable keyboards
I've ever typed on. Despite the keys being chiclet style they move in a very
positive way that really surprised me. It doesn't hurt to type, at all, and
I'm finding I can type faster on this keyboard than any other I've typed on
before.</p>
<p>There is a flipside though. I find the whole design far too cramped. Even now,
a couple of weeks later, as I type this on it, I wish the keys were just a little
bigger and just a little more spaced out. I'm adjusting, of course -- much of
this is about muscle memory -- but it does mean that it's in a constant fight
with my "knowledge" of my other main keyboards.</p>
<p>And then there's the keys that it lacks.</p>
<p>I'm still finding that this is a terrible keyboard for a programmer. For one
thing, here on the UK version of the keyboard, there's no # key. At least,
there's no simple, comfortable, direct access to the # key. Any time I want
to type a # I have to shift my left hand to find the (I think it's called
the) option key and hit 3. Shift 3 is £. And it gets even worse. This setup
doesn't work at all in GNU emacs so I then have to put the keyboard in
Australian mode so I can use shift-3 to get a #.</p>
<p>Why there isn't a proper # key is beyond me.</p>
<p>And then there's the (on the version that came with this iMac) complete lack
of page keys as well as home and end. Overall this makes the whole keyboard
feel very unfriendly to programmers and also to writers in general.</p>
<p>This, of course, is my bias and muscle memory from PCs showing. I'm still not
convinced that that bias and muscle memory is wrong.</p>
<h1>The mouse</h1>
<p>When I first started with it I hated the mouse. I should be fair and point out
that, overall, I hate mice anyway. For a good 20 years I've thrown away every
mouse I've ever had turn up with a machine and have made use of a trackball
instead. I find that a trackball gives me far more control and is far more
comfortable. So, initially, I put the Apple mouse to one side and plugged
in a trackball instead.</p>
<p>For reasons I forget now I found myself needed to use the Apple mouse again.
Once I did that I decided to "force" myself to give it a fair shot and, now,
I'm glad I did. Much like with the keyboard, despite me having a bias against
what it is, this has turned out to be one of the most comfortable mice I've
ever used. It sits right in the hand, the lack of actual buttons means I don't
have to shape my hand to fit the design but, instead, the design allows for
how my hand rests. I also rather like the gestures too.</p>
<p>This is the first mouse that has stayed on my desktop. I'm surprised.</p>
<p>By the way, whoever thought that the "natural" scroll option, which is on by
default, was "natural", is barking mad.</p>
<h1>The GUI</h1>
<p>One of the main intended uses for this machine is the Unix shell, working
inside the terminal. Given that the actual UI of the OS doesn't matter so
much to me. That said, I'm finding it pretty pleasant. I find it a lot
tidier-looking than Windows, although I also find it more frustrating in
some places.</p>
<p>One good example is in the Finder, when I have a folder open. I find that it's
quite common for me, on Windows, when I have an Explorer window open, to want
to copy the path of the folder for use elsewhere. That's very easy to do
because the path is in an edit field at the top of the window and can be
edited and copied. If there's a way to do this with the OS X Finder I've
yet to figure that one one.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm still not getting used to, and I'm still very unconvinced by,
as a design decision, is the business of having an application's menus always
appear at the top of the screen disconnected from the application windows
themselves. I appreciate that this is a very Apple/Mac way of doing things
but I really can't get used to the idea -- especially given that it gives
the (incorrect) impression that the whole GUI is really single tasking.</p>
<p>On the whole though most of this doesn't matter too much to me. Large parts
of what I'm doing is in the terminal window, with other parts of it being
in my editors of choice (either SublimeText or GNU emacs, depending on what
I'm doing) or inside Google Chrome. In other words the general experience is
one that carries over most of the main operating systems I've used on
desktop machines.</p>
<h1>Installing software</h1>
<p>For an operating system that prides itself on being simple to use and easy
to understand, and especially one whose bigger fans sell as being simple to
use and easy to understand (especially in relation to Windows), the whole
business of installing software seems very confusing and very scrappy.</p>
<p>So far I've found a few different ways of installing software and none of it
makes a whole lot of sense to me without going and searching about it and
reading up on it. Sometimes I download an app and all I need to do is drag
it into the Applications folder. Other times I get a zip which I have to open
and then... it can go a couple of different ways. Sometimes I get a 'dmg' and
when I open that up I get a window where I have to drag one icon onto another
icon in that window to do the install. Sometimes I get something like the last
one I mention but instead I have to double-click on an icon that's in the
window.</p>
<p>There might even be other options I've had to follow. I forget now.</p>
<p>And then there's the business of removing software! That seems to be complete
chaos. In some cases you delete the app and it's all good. In other cases
you need to do that and hunt down some other bits and remove them too. In
other cases it seems like the author has supplied their own uninstaller.</p>
<p>We've been here before. I know this setup rather well. This is exactly the
sort of world we lived in back when Windows 3.1 was a new thing. This came as
and still is a massive surprise to me: OS X is as sophisticated as a fancy
shell that ran on top of MS DOS when it comes to software management.</p>
<h1>Doing the right thing, except when not</h1>
<p>While I'm on the subject of the famous great design of the Mac... what's up
with the business of seeing the time format? The system preferences seem
very flexible when it comes to setting date and time formats. I really like
the dialog that provides this:</p>
<p><img alt="Setting the date format" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.23.39.png"></p>
<p>As you might see above, my preference when it comes to date formats is to have
everything in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> format.
Having set that I then noticed that the time shown in the menu bar on the
desktop was.... whatever the hell Apple appear to have decided for me!</p>
<p><img alt="This is not the date format I asked for" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.26.18.png"></p>
<p>Even Windows lets me set the date format as I want it in the desktop time
display. Apple, meanwhile, seem to provide a great method of letting you
set your date and time formats "just so" and then they seem to just go right
ahead and ignore your preference in the one place you'll see it the most.</p>
<h1>If you have a Mac, you have software I wrote on it (I think)</h1>
<p>From what I could tell every Mac has a copy of GNU emacs installed, out of the
box. That actually kind of impressed me. Sure, it's a rather out of date
version of GNU emacs, but it's a copy of GNU emacs and that's all that matters.</p>
<p><img alt="It's a GNU emacs!" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.31.18.png"></p>
<p>That fact actually means something rather interesting, to me. See, there's
two small packages that are part of GNU emacs that I originally wrote. One is
called 5x5, the other quickurl.</p>
<p><img alt="My rubbish claim to fame" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.32.58.png"></p>
<p>So, yeah, from what I can see, on every new Mac you'll find two bodies of
code that I originally wrote, pre-installed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, shitty claim to fame. I'll take it anyway. ;)</p>
<h1>Overall initial impression</h1>
<p>Overall my initial impression is a good one. The Apple iMac seems to make for
a pretty good Unix workstation. The keyboard layout could do with some work
to make it more friendly to programmers (well, to this programmer) but
overall it all makes sense and is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If most of what you do is actually online then I'd say that an iMac would be
a huge waste of money. If you want a desktop machine for web browsing and
generally working "in the cloud" then you'd do a lot better to buy a Chromebase
(or, of course, a Chromebook if you're looking at Macbooks). On top of this,
if most of what you're doing is online but you want to do some client-side
stuff such as image/video editing and gaming then I struggle to see how an iMac
would be a good choice too. For the money it's hilariously underpowered
when compared to a reasonably equivalent Windows PC (or, of course, GNU/Linux
machine if what you want to do can be done there).</p>
<p>My own reasons for purchase were about having a desktop Unix workstation that
I could install various compilers on so I could muck about and work on some
fun projects I want to get done. It was an unusual extravagance that I don't
regret and, so far, I've been pleased with.</p>
<p>There's very few people I'd actually recommend one to though as it seems
pretty clear to me that, generally, their money could buy them so much more.</p>
<p>But it's a nice new shiny toy. ;)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I'm on a bit of a "explore other universes" trip at the moment, it would seem.
The other weekend I finally cracked and purchased my first ever OS X device
and, earlier today, I purchased my first ever iOS device.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm not abandoning the world of Android; far from it if my
experiences of iOS so far are anything to go by. However, having started
slowly working through a book that teaches Cocoa and Swift I thought it might
be interesting to be in a position, at some point in the future, to be able
to make and throw an app at an iOS device and it seemed the most affordable
way of doing that was to grab an iPod.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p><img alt="I now own an iPod" src="/attachments/2015/06/23/Photo 23-06-2015 22 50 51.png"></p>
<p>One of the first things I did, and I'm glad to find it was possible, was to
load it up with apps that make it into a reasonable Google device (so, so far,
I've got Gmail, Google+, Google Calendar and Google Music on there -- need
to sort Google Drive too, at least). Next up was to get some music on it too --
might as well actually use it to listen to music, I guess.</p>
<p>That actually turned out to be more fun than I was expecting. See, I gave up
on iTunes many years ago, back when it was pretty much the only legit method
of buying music online. Since then I've tended to work with ripped copies of
my CD collection or I've listened to music I've bought on Google Play (the
latter bulked out with the former thanks to Google's music uploader).</p>
<p>And here's the fun part: if you use the recent Google Music Chrome app (which,
it seems, allows unlimited downloads of your albums) to pull the music down,
and drop them into iTune's import folder, magic happens and iTunes gets
nearly populated with music. Even better, music that I'd originally ripped as
WMAs comes back own as mp3s, so solving the problem of iTunes not doing WMAs.</p>
<p>Handy!</p>
<p>So, anyway, that's the iPod set up as a generally useful device.</p>
<p>As for iOS itself.... Ugh. I'm far from impressed. Compared to Android it
feels old and clunky and very constraining. For example, I can't <em>really</em>
control what's on the home page. Sure, I can move things about, and I can
even remove apps I've installed, but I can't remove/hide Apple's own apps
at all. The best I've managed to do is drop all of them in a folder together
and ignore that folder.</p>
<p>I'm finding the whole navigation thing kind of frustrating too. The back of
a standard back button -- as you have on Android -- means that different apps
seem to do different things in terms of allowing back navigation. I'm also
still unsure how you can easily task switch (if there is a way of doing that
it's not obvious to me).</p>
<p>Another thing that's frustrating me is "AirDrop". I tried to use it to get
the screenshot you see above onto my iMac but nothing I did would make it work.
The iPod would see the iMac and the iMac would see the iPod but the filed
didn't appear to want to move at all.</p>
<p>Yet another thing that seems rather unstable is the whole business of WiFi
sync. That seems like a sensible idea -- let iTunes on the Mac know that
the iPod lives on the same network and have them sync that way. Problem is
that I'm finding that it drop out during a sync more often than not. The only
reliable method of doing a sync that I've found is to use the USB cable.</p>
<p>I've yet to write the blog post about my experiences with the Mac so far
but what I'm finding here fits in with what I've found with the Mac: some
of the ideas are really rather clever but they just don't quite work as
well as people would seem to want to have you believe. Apple gear has this
reputation of "just working" and I'm finding that this really doesn't seem
to be the case at all.</p>
<p>Still, it's all a learning process and I know far more about Apple gear now
than I did a week or so back, and I'm learning more as I go.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>For a long time now Chrome has been my web browser of choice. It has, to some
degree, become my "other emacs" (ignoring for a moment that my use of GNU
emacs has sort of lapsed the last few years). By that I mean that it's a
portable environment that serves me well on many operating systems and, for
one of my machines, actually <em>is</em> the operating system. I really appreciate how
Chrome's sync lets me feel right at home no matter which machine I'm on.</p>
<p>But I've run into one small issue that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>In some situations I find it pleasing, and I find it makes sense, that some
web "apps" open in a window of their own rather than in a Chrome tab. On Windows
and on ChromeOS this is simple enough, all I need to do is find the "app" in
the Chrome app launcher, pull up the content menu, and tell it to open as a
window.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on Windows 7" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextWin.png"></p>
<p>Nice and simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac, so well known for doing everything every other OS does but doing
it better and being easier to use.... you'd expect it's at least the same there,
right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on OS X" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextMac.png"></p>
<p>There's no option at all to open as a window!</p>
<p>So, on the Mac, while I'd love to be able to open Gmail as a window/app in its
own right, I'm totally out of luck, it seems. I've no idea whose "fault" this
is. It's not clear to me if this is a Chrome/Google decision or if it's about
how things have to work on a Mac. Thing is, I find it hard to believe that
it's the latter given that Google Keep runs in its own window on the Mac and
I can happily pin it to the dock.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It's that simple on ChromeOS too. In case you're wondering why I
didn't also illustrate that, it's because you can't take a screenshot on
ChromeOS while you've got a context menu open. O_o&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Hello, world.</p>
<p>So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set
of posts on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts">Google+</a> or a torrent
of 140-character thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">twitter</a> but
an actual blog.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects
I want to have a go at over the next few months and writing about them as I
work on them might be fun. Another reason is that I've being wanting to explore
the business of hosting a blog on GitHub pages for quite some time and now's
the perfect time to do it.</p>
<p>So how am I doing this? Well, for starters, I recently acquired an iMac. The
reasons for how and why I chose to do this are varied and mostly uninteresting
but what it does mean is that, for the first time in quite a long time, I
have a Unix desktop machine again. This fact alone means it's nice and easy
for me to play with the likes of Git (or, at the moment more
<a href="https://mac.github.com/">GitHub for Mac</a> than the command line git), ruby,
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> (along with
<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll">a rather nifty package for quickly kicking off a blog post</a>).
So that's how I'm doing it. Writing it all locally and pushing it up to
GitHub and hosting it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>As this goes on I imagine much will change. I've started out with a basic
setup, created by simply using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>davep@Ariel:~/blogging$<span class="w"> </span>jekyll<span class="w"> </span>new<span class="w"> </span>davep.github.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>From now on I'll be playing with styles and my own layouts to see what I can
come up with and what I like (although, I most say, for the most part I'm
actually liking the clean look it delivers out of the box).</p>
<p>One thing that's obviously missing right now is a facility for commenting.
That's something I'll look into should I feel it's necessary -- from what I've
seen elsewhere it's easy enough to make use of something like
<a href="https://disqus.com/">disqus</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>One other thing I might look at doing is putting this behind my own domain.
For the moment it's only available via github.io and I guess it might look
nicer if it was actually available via a URL that looks like the name I've
attached to the blog. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's it for now. Time to push this up and think some more about
where it'll go from here.</p></div>
