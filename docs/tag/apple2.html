  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I'm going to file this one under "it seems really unnecessary, but it's also
kinda cool". While reading up about
<a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html">protocols</a>
the book I'm reading introduced the <code>ExpressibleBy*Literal</code> protocols, where
the <code>*</code> is one of a number of obvious literals. For example:
<code>ExpressibleByStringLiteral</code>. As you might imagine, it lets you create a
class that can be initialised with a literal value, as opposed to needing to
appear to call the constructor for a class.</p>
<p>So, for a silly example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Hello</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">ExpressibleByStringLiteral</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">what</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span>

    <span class="kr">required</span> <span class="kd">init</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">stringLiteral</span> <span class="n">what</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">what</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">what</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">say</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">what</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">!&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You could, of course, write this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">v1</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Hello</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;world&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">v1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">say</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>but because of <code>ExpressibleByStringLiteral</code> you can also write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">v2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;universe&quot;</span>
<span class="n">v2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">say</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, sure, in this case it saves you nothing, but this does also mean that
parameters of functions whose type uses one of the <code>`ExpressibleBy*Literal</code>
protocols can be passed a literal, rather than a "long-hand" instantiated
object. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">Greet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">h</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">say</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">Greet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;davep&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I can see that being quite handy.</p></div>

      <div><p>I'm going to file this one under "it makes perfect sense, but I don't think
it aids in making the code readable" -- something which I'm finding is a bit
of a theme with Swift.</p>
<p>In Swift <code>self</code> gets used and gets used in a way you'd expect from many
other languages. So far so good. But, it seems, <code>Self</code> is also a thing too,
and it's different from <code>self</code>. Whereas <code>self</code> is the current instance,
<code>Self</code> is the current type. So consider this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Greeting</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">func</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s">&quot;Ayup!&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s">&quot;Well hello there&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">emit</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">Self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">Greeting</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">emit</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When run, the output is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Ayup!
Well hello there
</code></pre></div>

<p>It makes sense that that's the case. I actually really like the ability to
use <code>Self</code> rather than having to use <code>Greeting</code>, but damn that's really
setting things up for either mistyping or misreading code. You're going to
want to hope that your development environment makes it super obvious what's
a value and what's a type when it comes to using font choices.</p></div>

      <div><p>Some languages favour a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">"one way to do
it"</a> approach, some favour
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">"there's more than one way to do
it"</a>.
I'm not sure I'm at a point where I have a feel for what Swift's approach
is, but I'm getting the impression it's more the latter than the former.</p>
<p>If there was one thing that made me think that, it was when I found out that
Swift's <code>bool</code> type has a <code>toggle</code> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nv">cool</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="kc">false</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">cool</span>
<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cool</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">toggle</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>giving:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>swift<span class="w"> </span>run
<span class="nb">false</span>
<span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nb">false</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I can see a number of reasons why that's actually going to be handy -- the
main one being when you want to throw around a toggling method -- but it
still struck me as rather odd on first reading. I also think it's worth me
making a personal note about it because <code>foo.toggle()</code> isn't going to stand
out as much as <code>foo = !foo</code> when reading code. At least not for a short
while.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Today's little "Swift TIL" is observers. While reading up on the language I
was delighted to find that it has observer support baked right into the
language, for any sort of variable. So code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nv">name</span>  <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;David&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kr">willSet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;About to change name from </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s"> to </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kr">didSet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">old</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Name changed from </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">old</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s"> to </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">name</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;davep&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Does what you'd imagine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>About to change name from David to davep
Name changed from David to davep
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not only can I see how that'd be useful for the main sorts of purposes that
Swift is put to, I can think of many times when I'd have benefitted from
that in my general day-to-day work. Of course, you can create an observer
approach in any language really, but having an idiom that's part of the
language feels nice and tidy.</p></div>

      <div><p><a href="/2020/06/22/swift-til-1.html">Following on</a> with writing little notes to
myself so I remember some key things as I learn about Swift...</p>
<p>I sort of feel like this will make reading code a little harder, so it's one
I want to keep in mind. When calling an instance method, if it's not
ambiguous, you can omit <code>self.</code> from the call. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">outer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">outer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This makes me feel a little uneasy, and I strongly suspect I'll always use
<code>self.</code> when writing such code: I'm a big fan of the idea that we write code
for people, not for compilers.</p></div>

      <div><p>As <a href="/2020/06/21/a-second-attempt-to-learn-swift.html">I mentioned
yesterday</a>,
I'm going to make a small series of posts where I write down things that
I've stumbled on while getting to know Swift that are, for me personally,
worthy of note, different, unusual, cool, or just simply "WTF!?!".</p>
<p>Because learning new stuff is fun.</p>
<p>My first one is that you can use keywords as identifiers if you "escape"
them with backticks. Kind of like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;let&quot;</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm struggling to imagine a situation where I'd ever want to do this. I'm
still unsure if my reaction is "that's cool" or "WTF?!?".</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's five years ago this month that I bought myself my first macOS (then OS
X) device. After many years of having a Windows machine as my daily driver,
which was also my work machine (I worked from home), I decided it was high
time that I returned to having a Unix-a-like system on my desk too. For a
decade or so, starting in the later-90s, I'd had a GNU/Linux desktop. I
still had a Windows desktop (until a couple of years ago most of my work was
on DOS and Windows), but thanks to the wonders of a KVM, and later an X
server that ran on Windows, my personal hacking was done on a GNU/Linux
desktop.</p>
<p>But as things moved around, priorities changed, as life moved on, the
GNU/Linux boxes got retired and never quite replaced. Eventually, in 2015, I
found myself with the means and desire to recover that sort of setup. Long
story short, after a lot of reading up and weighing up options I decided
that the best option for a desktop Unix was... an iMac!</p>
<p>I loved it. Sure, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">there were lots of little things on the surface that were
different or annoying or just plain not as cool as the Mac fans would tell
you</a>,
but under the hood I found what I needed: a Unix CLI with all the things I
knew well. And, of course, it ran GNU Emacs just fine; that was the really
important thing for me.</p>
<p>Pretty much right away I decided that it might be fun to learn the tools
necessary to develop native Mac apps, and perhaps even iOS apps. I
downloaded XCode, bought a book, and started working through it. Having got
that book, I decided it might be interesting to own an iOS device too. So,
sort of needing an MP3 player, and having no wish to get an iPhone, <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I got
myself an iPod
Touch</a>. So I
was all set to devour the Swift book, write some stuff for OS X, create an
iOS app or two, and... life happened. Stuff cropped up that distracted me
from taking that further and I never really returned to working through the
book.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now and that initial iMac and iPod purchase spiralled a wee
bit. Next after the iPod was an iPad Mini, when my Nexus 7 was starting to
show its age and it was obvious that Google wasn't going to produce any more
good Android tablets. Then, when I needed a very portable Unix-a-like
machine for trips between where I was living and Edinburgh, <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">I got myself a
MacBook Air</a>.
Since then the iPod Touch has been replaced once, as has the iPad Mini. I
now also own an iPad and a MacBook Pro. Unless Apple screw up and turn Macs
into something unusable for developers (there are rumours), I imagine I'll
be using Apple devices for some time to come now.</p>
<p>And then, last month, having finally got frustrated with where Google were
going with Android and the Pixel series, I jumped ship to the iPhone 11.</p>
<p>As of right now I'm in a situation where I'm all about the Apple ecosystem
regarding hardware and operating systems (including for my work machine),
all of which is there to support my heavy use of the Google ecosystem
(actually, the one bit of Google hardware I still lean on heavily is the
Google Home -- I have 3 around my home).</p>
<p>So... given all of that, I thought it was time to look at returning to
learning Swift, with a view to writing some native macOS and i(Pad)OS stuff.
I soon realised that the book I'd bought back in 2015 was rather out of
date. It covers Swift 1.2 -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Version_history">we're now up to
5.2</a>!
Given this, and given I've forgotten pretty much everything I'd read at the
time, I decided I should start again from scratch.</p>
<p>This weekend I've started reading my way though <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ios-13-programming/9781492074526/"><em>iOS Programming
Fundamentals with
Swift</em></a>.
While this obviously has an emphasis on iOS, I'm already finding that the
first part of the book is a really great introduction to the Swift language
in general. The pace seems just right, and the way topics are grouped makes
it easy enough for me to skip over what's obvious (I don't need to know what
objected-oriented programming is, and what the difference between a class
and an object is, etc) and read up on the detail of this particular language
when it comes to general concepts I know (knowing the differences between a
class, struct and enum in the language is important, for example).</p>
<p>I've yet to write a line of code, but I'm fine with that. The book is
spending a lot of time introducing the language before encouraging you to
fire up XCode, and I'm okay with that. I'm never a fan of being asked to
write out code that I can't properly follow -- that just makes stuff look
like magic when it's far more educational to know what's going on. What I am
finding is I'm making lots of notes that are either <em>"oh, yeah, this is
cool, I like this idea!"</em> or <em>"WTF are you kidding me?!?"</em>. Which is really
nice -- it's always great to learn a new language that's a bit different
from what you normally use.</p>
<p>My plan then, over the next few weeks, it to keep at this and hopefully
document my journey. I think I'd like to write a short series of TIL-type
posts; nothing too long, just some new thing I read or discovered and my
reaction to it. So, if you happen to follow this blog, I apologise in
advance for any Swift-spam.</p>
<p>You have been warned. ;-)</p></div>

      <div><p>Over the past couple or so
weeks <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">my Macbook air</a> has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"></p>
<p>Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.</p>
<p>So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.</p>
<p>I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.</p>
<p>I joined the queue.</p>
<p>About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.</p>
<p>By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p>So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.</p>
<p>Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.</p>
<p>Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).</p>
<p>I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.</p>
<p>So I had to go and look.</p>
<p>Having looked I came away with one.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.</p>
<p>As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.</p>
<p>For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.</p>
<p>And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.</p></div>

      <div><p>A little earlier today I decided it was time that I read up a little more about
the abilities of OS X's Spotlight facility. I use it a little -- it's a handy
tool to get at some often-used applications that I don't really need laying
around in the dock -- but I was starting to wonder if I could get more out of
it.</p>
<p>The obvious first place to look was in the HelpViewer; all the information I'm
ever going to need will be on the local machine, right?</p>
<p>So I open the HelpViewer, from the Spotlight bar, and type in that I want
information about Spotlight. The page comes up blank. The page was pretty small
so, while I pondered why it might be blank, I resized it and it disappeared!
I tried to open it again and.... nothing. Nothing I did would make the
HelpViewer show again.</p>
<p>I then tried following the advice
<a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Troubleshooting_Help_Viewer">on this page</a> but
none of that appeared to help. I then looked for the HelpViewer in the
Activity Monitor and killed it with that.</p>
<p>Running it again after that got me back to where I started. I tried the while
process again and, sure enough, trying to resize the window made it disappear.
I can make it happen every single time:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/id9Gb8SDYrg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>So it looks like another fine example of the Apple "it just works" thing.
For "doesn't always just work" values of "just works".</p></div>
