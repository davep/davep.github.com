<p>Much like <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">Norton Guide readers</a> or
the <a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories&amp;q=5x5&amp;type=&amp;language=&amp;sort=">5x5
puzzle</a>,
code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto
exercises. I've written versions in many languages, and messed with plot in
some different environments, as varied as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ytRZrHL34">in VR on the
web</a> to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Self-Documenting-Mandelbrot-by-davepearson/1341910.0S66D">wearable
items</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">my involvement with
Textualize</a> I
<a href="https://github.com/davep/trMandelbrot">wrote a deliberately worst-approach
version</a> using that framework. The
whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also
stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job.</p>
<p>Later on I did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot">a second version that targets
Textual</a>. This time it did a
better job and was the catalyst for building
<a href="https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>. This version was
intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example
application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible
version mentioned above, I still wasn't 100% happy with the way it worked.</p>
<p>Recently I did some maintenance work on <code>textual-canvas</code>, cleaning up the
repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python
projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at
<code>textual-mandelbrot</code> and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn't really
sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not
that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick
off a fresh stand-alone application.</p>
<p><a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/">Complexitty</a> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Complexitty on startup" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty.png"></p>
<p>Right now the application has all the same features as the <code>mandelexp</code>
application that came with <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>, plus a couple more. Also
it's built on top of <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced">the common core
library</a> I've been putting
together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on
<a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ATODO%20label%3AEnhancement">I'll add more
features</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed in with Complexitty" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-red.png"></p>
<p>As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with
comprehensive help for commands and key bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-help.png"></p>
<p>and there's also a command palette that also helps you discover (and run)
commands and their keyboard bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-commands.png"></p>
<p>Complexitty is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/complexitty/">via
PyPI</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>complexitty
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>complexitty</code>:</p>

      <div><p>I've <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/releases/tag/v0.3.0">just released AgiNG
v0.3.0</a>. The main focus
of this release was to get some searching added to the application. Similar
to what I added to <a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">WEG</a> back in the day, I
wanted three types of searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current entry search.</li>
<li>Current guide-wide search.</li>
<li>All registered guides-wide search.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current entry search is done with a simple modal input, and for now the
searching is always case-insensitive (I was going to add a switch for this
but it sort of felt unnecessary and I liked how clean the input is).</p>
<p><img alt="Entry search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search.png"></p>
<p>The search is started by pressing <kbd>/</kbd>, and if a hit is found
<kbd>n</kbd> will take you through all subsequent matches.</p>
<p>As always, if you're not sure of the keys, you'll find them in the help
screen or via the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="Looking up search in the command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search-palette.png"></p>
<p>Guide-wide and all-guide searching is done in the same dialog. To search
guide-wide you enter what you want to find and untick <em>"All Guides"</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Setting up a guide search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-setup.png"></p>
<p>With that, the search will stick to the current guide.</p>
<p><img alt="Guide-wide search running" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-running.png"></p>
<p>As will be obvious, searching all guides that have been registered with
AgiNG is as simple as ticking <em>"All Guides"</em>. Then when you search it'll
take a walk through every entry of every guide you've added to the guide
directory in the application.</p>
<p><img alt="Gide-wide searching" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-search.gif#centre"></p>
<p>Global searching is accessed with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/<kbd> or via the
command palette.</p>
<p><img alt="Finding global search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/global-palette.png"></p>
<p>With this added, I think that's most of the major functionality I wanted for
AgiNG. I imagine there's a few more tweaks I'll think of (for example: I
think adding regex search to the global search screen could be handy), but I
don't think there's any more big features it needs.</p>
<p>AgiNG can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>aging</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>aging
</code></pre></div>

<p>It seems I really do still have this need to create new terminal-based
projects at the moment. There's been
<a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">Braindrop</a>, then
<a href="/2025/01/25/peplum.html">Peplum</a>, then after that came
<a href="/2025/02/14/hike.html">Hike</a>. While I'm still tweaking and adding to them,
and also using them to refine <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced">a wee library I'm building up that forms the
core of my latest apps</a>, I felt I
still had this one app that I <em>needed</em> to finally build.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s I've had this mild obsession with <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">building tools for
maintaining access to Norton Guide
files</a>. I've written readers for
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg">GNU/Linux (which also works on macOS too)</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2">OS/2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el">GNU
Emacs</a>, and also or the web (in multiple
incarnations). Those builds have covered a few languages, including C, C++,
Pascal, JavaScript and Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>I'd never written a Python library or application for it though.</p>
<p>So when I first saw Textual mentioned in passing on Twitter a few years
back, way back in the 0.1 days, I thought that could be the thing that would
push me over the edge. In anticipation of that, back in 2021, I initially
developed <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/"><code>ngdb.py</code></a>. This is a library
that provides the core Norton Guide reading code for Python applications and
could form the basis for other tools.</p>
<p>As a test for this I then wrote <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web"><code>ng2web</code></a>
(which works, but I think still needs a bit of tidying up -- something I'm
aiming to do in the next few weeks).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the journey with Textual itself <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">kicked
off</a>, happened, and <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">came to an
end</a>; and yet somehow I'd never got
round to building the thing I'd initially looked at Textual for: a
terminal-based Norton Guide reader that looked nice and modern (by terminal
standards). When I initially joined Textualize the owner had actually said
they wanted me to build this as test of the framework, to essentially start
out by employing me to create some Free Software that would help dogfood the
library, but that seemed to get forgotten.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of this month and I finally felt it was time to
tackle this. The result is <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging">AgiNG</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-dark.png"></p>
<p>As of v0.1.0 it has most of the features you'd expect from a usable Norton
Guide reader, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ability to add guide files to an in-application directory.</li>
<li>The ability open and navigate a guide.</li>
<li>Full see-also support, etc.</li>
<li>Full translation of characters as were under MS-DOS into the terminal.</li>
<li>The ability to copy entry text or source to the clipboard.</li>
<li>The ability to copy save entry text or source to a file.</li>
<li>Access to a guide's credits.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AgiNG showing a long entry" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-long-entry.png"></p>
<p>I still need to write some proper documentation for the application, but
meanwhile all commands and key shortcuts can be discovered either via the
help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG help" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-help-screen.png"></p>
<p>or by pulling up the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>Hopefully the workings of the application will be fairly obvious to anyone
who is familiar with Norton Guide files; if anything isn't making sense <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/q-a">I'm
more than happy to answer
questions</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/ideas">take suggestions for
improvements</a>.</p>
<p>One wee feature I want to call out, that I felt was important to add, was a
"classic view" facility. The thing with Norton Guide files is they were
mostly created in the very late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s. People would
often get creative with the colouring within them, but in many cases the
colouring assumed the default Norton Guide application. Its colours were
white text on a blue background. So sometimes other colouring was done
assuming that background.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this here, with an entry in a guide being viewed
using the default <code>textual-dark</code> theme:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in textual-dark" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/textual-dark.png"></p>
<p>Notice the colouring in the syntax section. This is more obvious if the
application is switched to one of the light themes:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in solarized-light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/solarized-light.png"></p>
<p>With a nod to this issue in mind, I added the "classic view" for entries
(which is a sticky setting -- turn it on and it stays on until you turn it
off):</p>
<p><img alt="Classic view in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/classic-view.png"></p>
<p>A little hard on the eyes, I think, but also filled with nostalgia!</p>
<p>Talking of themes, all the usual application themes are available, here's a
wee selection:</p>
<p><img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-nord.png">
<img alt="Textual Light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-light.png">

  <div>
      <div><p>I've just made a wee update to
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a>, my dialog
library for <a href="https://textual.textualize.io">Textual</a> which adds <code>FileOpen</code>,
<code>FileSave</code> and <code>SelectDirectory</code> dialogs. There's no substantial change to
the workings of the library itself, but I have added something it's been
lacking for a long time: documentation!</p>
<p>Well... that's not quite true, it's always had documentation. I'm an avid
writer of Python docstrings and I make a point of always writing them for
every class, function, method or global value as I write the code. As such
the low-level "API" documentation has always been sat there ready to be
published somehow, eventually.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the description for how to use the library was mostly a pointer to
some example code inside the README. Not ideal, and something I really
wanted to improve at some point.</p>
<p>Given I'm still on a bit of a coding spree in my spare time, I finally
decided to get round to using the amazing
<a href="https://mkdocstrings.github.io">mkdocstrings</a>, in conjunction with
<a href="https://www.mkdocs.org">mkdocs</a>, to <a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/">get some better documentation up an
running</a>.</p>
<p>The approach I decided to take with the documentation was to <a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/using/">have a page
that gave some general information on how to use the
library</a> and then also
<a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/library-contents/base_dialog/">generate low-level documentation for the all the useful content of the
library from the
docstrings</a>.
While latter isn't really useful to anyone wanting to use the library in
their own applications, it could be useful to anyone wanting to understand
how it hangs together at a lower-level, perhaps because they want to
contribute to or extend the library in some way.</p>
<p>While writing some of the general guide took a bit of work, of course, the
work to get the documentation up and running and generating was simple
enough. The effort comes down to 3 rules in the
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/blob/ad6818c96816f2f1ad7a39909d276271af3f760d/Makefile"><code>Makefile</code></a>
for the project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">##############################################################################</span>

<span class="nf">.PHONY</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">docs</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rtfm</code> target is useful for locally-serving the documentation so I can
live preview as I write things and update the code. The <code>publishdocs</code> target
is used to create and push a <code>gh-pages</code> branch for the repository, resulting
in the documentation being hosted by GitHub.</p>
<h2>A wee problem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOTE: <a href="/2025/02/28/mkdocs-gh-pages-redux.html">I've since found out there's an easier way of fixing the issue</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, however, where I ran into a wee problem. I noticed that the
locally-hosted version of the documentation looked great, but the version
hosted on GitHub Pages was... not so great. I was seeing a load of text
alignment issues, and also whole bits of text just not appearing at all.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what I was seeing locally:</p>
<p><img alt="Good layout" src="/attachments/2025/02/28/good.png"></p>
<p>and here's what I was seeing being served up from GitHub Pages:</p>
<p><img alt="Bad layout" src="/attachments/2025/02/28/bad.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, in the "bad" version the <code>func</code> label is missing from the
header, and the <code>Parameters</code> and <code>Returns</code> tables look quite messy.</p>
<p>I spent a little bit of time digging and, looking in Safari's console, I
then noticed that I was getting a 404 on a file called <code>_mkdocstrings.css</code>
in the <code>assets</code> folder. Problem found!</p>
<p>Only... was it though? If I looked in the <code>gh-pages</code> local branch the file
was there (and with fine permissions). If I looked in the remote branch, it
was there too. Thinking it could be some odd browser problem I even tried to
grab the file back from the command line and it came back 404 as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Testing from the command line" src="/attachments/2025/02/28/http-grab.png"></p>
<p>At this point it was getting kind of late so I decided I must have screwed
up somehow but I should leave it for the evening and head to bed. Before
doing so though <a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742">I decided to drop a question into the mkdocstrings
discussions to see if anyone could see where I'd messed
up</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it looked like I hadn't messed up and the reply from the
<a href="https://github.com/pawamoy">always super-helpful Timothée</a> was, in effect,
<em>"yeah, that should work fine"</em>. At least I wasn't the only one confused.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this morning and, with breakfast and coffee inside me, I
decided to try and methodically get to the bottom of it. I <a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742#discussioncomment-12348912">wrote up the
current state of
understanding</a>
and looked at what might be the common cause. The thing that stood out to me
was that this was a file that started with an underscore, so I did a quick
search for <em>"github pages underscore"</em> and right away landed on <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2022/11/08/how-to-use-underscores-with-github-pages/">this
result</a>.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>That had to be it!</p>
<p>A little bit of testing later and sure enough, the documentation hosted on
GitHub Pages looked exactly like the locally-hosted version.</p>
<p>So, TIL: by default sites hosted by GitHub Pages will pretend that any asset
that starts with an underscore doesn't exist, unless you have a <code>.nojekyll</code>
in the root of the repository, on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch (or whatever branch
you decide to serve from).</p>
<p>To make this all work I added <code>.nojekyll</code> to
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/tree/ad6818c96816f2f1ad7a39909d276271af3f760d/docs/source"><code>docs/source</code></a>
and added this to <code>mkdocs.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">exclude_docs</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">|</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="no">!.nojekyll</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All done!</p>
<p>And now I've worked out a simple workflow for using <code>mkdocs</code>/<code>mkdocstrings</code>
for my own Python projects, in conjunction with GitHub Pages, I guess I'll
start to sprinkle it over other projects too.</p></div>

<p>The run of writing new terminal-based tools that I want still keeps going.
First there was <a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">Braindrop</a>, then there was
<a href="/2025/01/25/peplum.html">Peplum</a>, and now, released today, there's
<a href="https://github.com/davep/hike">Hike</a>.</p>
<p>Hike is yet another terminal-based Markdown browser. While it's far from the
first, and unlikely to be the last, it's mine and it looks and works exactly
how I need. Perhaps it'll be your sort of thing too?</p>
<p><img alt="Hike viewing its README" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-in-action.png"></p>
<p>This initial release has a bunch of handy features, including things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A command line where file names, URLs and commands can be entered.</li>
<li>A persistent history for the command line.</li>
<li>A local file browser.</li>
<li>A simple bookmarking system.</li>
<li>A browsing history.</li>
<li>Commands for quickly loading and viewing files held on GitHub, GitLab,
  Codeberg and Bitbucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>As there's a lot to discover in the application, I've tried to make the help
screen as comprehensive as possible:</p>
<p><img alt="Hike help" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-help.png"></p>
<p>and there's also the command palette to help with discovering commands and
the keys that are associated with them:</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in action" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>Once again, themes are supported so no matter your taste you should find
something that's easy on your eyes:</p>
<p><img alt="Dark" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-textual-dark.png">
<img alt="Light" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-textual-light.png">

<img alt="Solarized Light" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-solarized-light.png"></p>
<p>Hike is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/hike">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hike/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>hike
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>hike</code>:</p>

  <div>
      <div><p><img alt="Peplum" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-social-banner.png"></p>
<p>I seem to be back in the swing of writing handy (for me) little
terminal-based applications again. Having not long since <a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">released
Braindrop</a> (which I'm still working on and
tinkering with; it'll get more features in the near future, for sure), I had
an idea for another tool I'd like to have: something for looking through,
searching, and filtering <a href="https://peps.python.org">Python PEPs</a>.</p>
<p>As with anyone who is interested in what's happening with Python itself, I
subscribe to the RSS feed of the latest Python PEPs, but I also wanted
something that would let me look back at older ones in a way that worked
<em>"just so"</em> (<em>"just so" being "what feels right for me"</em>, of course). Having
finished the main work on Braindrop I realised that the general layout of
its UI would work here, as would the filtering and searching approach I
used.</p>
<p>From this idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/peplum">Peplum</a> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Peplum in action" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum.png"></p>
<p>In this first release I've simply concentrated on all things to do with
grabbing the list of PEPs and presenting them in a useful way; adding
various forms of filtering them; adding the ability to search the metadata;
that sort of thing. I aim to keep developing this out over the next few
weeks and months, adding things like the ability to make notes, to locally
view the text of a PEP, perhaps even to mark PEPs as unread and read, etc.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, much of the design was driven by what I did with
Braindrop, so once again I've tried my very best to make it
keyboard-friendly and as much as possible keyboard-first. This sometimes
means having to work against how Textual works, but generally that isn't too
tricky to do. I'm once again making heavy use of the command palette and
also ensuring that all commands that have corresponding keyboard bindings
are documented in the help screen.</p>
<p><img alt="Peplum Help" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-help.png"></p>
<p>There's enough common code between Peplum and Braindrop, when it comes to
this aspect of building a Textual application, that I'm minded to spin it
out into a little library of its own. I'm going to sit on this code for a
wee while and see how it develops, but I can see me taking this approach
with future applications and doing this will stop the need to copy and
paste.</p>
<p>It might also be useful to others building with Textual.</p>
<p>Also as with Braindrop, themes are a thing, and the theme setting is sticky
so you can set it the once and stick with that you like. Here's some
examples:</p>
<p><img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-nord.png">
<img alt="Catppuccin Latte" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-catppuccin-latte.png">
<img alt="Tokyo Night" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-tokyo-night.png"></p>
<p>That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.</p>
<p>While working on this project I managed to find a couple more bugs in
Textual, including <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5488">a fun way to get <code>transparent</code> backgrounds to get out of
sync</a> and also a way to
get <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5489">an easy crash out of <code>OptionList</code> if it's set to <code>width:
auto</code></a>.</p>
<p>What was even more fun was I sort of <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/113843011699020404">discovered a bug in the Python PEP
API</a>. Thanks to
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@hugovk@mastodon.social">Hugo</a> noticing my <em>"huh,
weird"</em> post on Fosstodon, there's <a href="https://github.com/python/peps/issues/4211">now an issue for
it</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/python/peps/pull/4226">a PR in the
works</a>. In retrospect I should
have raised an issue myself; instead I fell into that <em>"they obviously know
what they're doing so it must be like this for a reason"</em> trap.</p>
<p>Lesson relearned: it's always better to ask and get an answer, than to
assume a thing is how it is for a reason you don't know; which I guess is a
version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus' law</a> really.</p>
<p>So that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out and
there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/peplum">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/peplum/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>peplum
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>peplum</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>peplum
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm going to be making good use of this and working on it more; I hope it's
useful to someone else. :-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><img alt="Braindrop" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-social-banner.png"></p>
<p>A touch over a year ago I did the initial work on an application called
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a>, a terminal-based client for
the Pinboard bookmarking service. I had a lot of fun building it and it was
an application that I used on a near-daily basis. However, around August
last year <a href="/2024/08/18/paindrop.html">I realised it was time for me to move on from Pinboard and try
something new</a>; based on various recommendations
I settled on <a href="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="(/2024/08/18/paindrop.html)">in the other blog post</a>, Raindrop
offered more or less everything I had with Pinboard and so the move was
fairly straightforward. The one thing that was missing though was an
application similar to Tinboard.</p>
<p>So, late on last year, with my winter break approaching, I decided to start
from scratch and build a <em>"Tinboard for Raindrop"</em>, which I'm calling
<a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop">Braindrop</a>.</p>
<p>This was going to be a bit of an adventure too. Since <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">being laid off from
Textualize earlier in 2024</a> I'd not
been following its development quite as closely as I used to, and had also
run into some issues and bugs with it since that time; moreover, as well as
various bugs appearing, some breaking changes had also been made. As such
this was going to be a process where I'd wrap my head around what's happened
with the framework over the prior six months or so.</p>
<p>Given all this, over the past couple of weeks I've been spending a few hours
a day doing some for-pleasure coding and v0.1.0 of Braindrop is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Main display" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-main.png"></p>
<p>As much as possible I've tried to keep the look and feel similar to that of
Tinboard, while also doing my best to avoid some of the <em>"ah, I wish I
hadn't done it this way"</em> design decisions I'd made. As of the time of
writing I'm very pleased with the result.</p>
<p><img alt="The edit dialog" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-edit.png"></p>
<p>One thing I did want to do is ensure that the application was as
keyboard-friendly as possible, while also still allowing use of the mouse.
Textual can sometimes get that wrong and I ran into an example of this while
trying to ensure that there's good in-application help. Somewhat recently
Textual added a built-in help system which, sadly, can't easily be used by
and navigated by someone using the keyboard. So instead I've recreated the
help system I built into Tinboard, while adopting the documentation standard
that Textual had settled on (which, coincidentally, was kind of similar to
what I did in Tinboard to start with).</p>
<p><img alt="The help dialog" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-help.png"></p>
<p>As with Tinboard, I've also made sure to make full use of the command
palette, with every action that makes sense having a keyboard hotkey as well
as a command in the palette. I also took things a little further and made
sure that the hotkeys are shown in the command palette for easier discovery.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>I've also made sure that Textual's new theme system is available for easy
use; so out goes dark/light mode toggling and in comes a collection of
different themes. Here's a wee selection as an example:</p>
<p><img alt="Example theme 1" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-1.png">
<img alt="Example theme 2" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-2.png">
<img alt="Example theme 3" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-3.png">
<img alt="Example theme 4" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-4.png"></p>
<p>That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.</p>
<p>There's a few more things I want to do before I consider the application
v1.0-ready, but it's already in use by me and working well. As I decide what
else I want to add to it <a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATODO">I'm building up a list of TODO
items</a>.</p>
<p>Given that my day job these days is quite varied, isn't quite so
coding-intensive, and isn't always related to all things Python, it's
actually been fun to sit down and hack up a pure Python application from
scratch again. It's also helped me discover a couple or so fresh bugs in
Textual (which <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/created_by/davep">I've
reported</a>, of
course) and given me the opportunity to <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pulls/davep">PR some trivial fixes as I've
noticed typos and stuff as I
go</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/braindrop/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>braindrop
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>braindrop</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>braindrop
</code></pre></div>

<p>I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)</p></div>

      <div><p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a> v0.14.0.
This release adds a <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/issues/49">feature that a user
requested</a>, where you can set
the default values for the privacy and read-later status of a new bookmark:</p>
<p><img alt="The application settings dialog" src="/attachments/2024/05/15/app-settings.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, any time you create a new bookmark, the edit dialog will use those
values by default. It's a feature that makes perfect sense but I didn't
think to add it early on because... well, I set the defaults to my
preference.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>tinboard

      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a> has turned into a tool I use
pretty much every day; it's probably my most-used Textual/Python-developed
application at this point. This is causing me to think more and more about
how I can add things to it that are related to the core purpose, but are
also outside of the main "interface with Pinboard" thing.</p>
<p>A thing with keeping bookmarks for a long time is that some of them go
stale, go away. Some will just plain 404, others the whole site will
disappear. If I find myself going back to a bookmark and seeing this is the
case, I'll hit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and see if
there's an archive there.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking: what if I add the ability to perform this check into
Tinboard itself? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDgiM6pUP2Y">So I did just that</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in the application, if you press <kbd>w</kbd> with a bookmark
highlighted, it will check with the Wayback Machine to see if the bookmark
is in the archive. If it isn't you see this:</p>
<p><img alt="No archive result" src="/attachments/2024/04/18/no-archive.png#centre"></p>
<p>On the other hand, if it <em>is</em> in the archive, you'll see something like
this:</p>
<p><img alt="Is in the archive result" src="/attachments/2024/04/18/has-archive.png#centre"></p>
<p>I sense this is going to be the first step in a couple of features related
to this. I'm thinking that I may go on to add a <em>"swap the URL for this
bookmark with the Wayback Machine archive URL"</em> feature, which will be handy
for those bookmarks that have one away, and it would also be useful to look
at the options for a <em>"please archive a copy of this bookmark"</em> feature.</p>
<p>But, for now, v0.12.0 is available and has this handy (for me anyway) first
step.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>tinboard

      <div><p>Back in the very early days of the <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">Textual
adventure</a>,
within the first month or so of working on the framework, we <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">had a period
of
dogfooding</a>.
One of the projects I wrote during that time was a little tool <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/12/08/be-the-keymaster/#pispy">I called
PISpy</a>.</p>
<p>The initial version was pretty much a quick hack; during that dogfooding
period I did my best to try and develop a new project every couple of days.
Since then I've let PISpy descend into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">bit
rot</a>.</p>
<p>In the last week or so I've turned my attention back to it and made an
effort to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CepsN8TDq1E">tidy up the code</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EUXA8RkN0">tidy it some more</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u5CfrgZWcc">and some
more</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDCvWCZx1AM">even some
more</a>.</p>
<p>This morning I put the finishing touches to these changes and released
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pispy/releases/tag/v0.6.0">v0.6.0</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/67xtMdstbx4"><img alt="PISpy in action" src="/attachments/2024/04/17/pispy-in-action.gif#centre"></a></p>
<p>PISpy can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideallty) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">from
PyPI</a>. It can also be installed with
Homebrew by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>pispy</code>:</p>
