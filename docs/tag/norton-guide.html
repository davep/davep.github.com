  <div>
      <div><p>I've <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/releases/tag/v0.3.0">just released AgiNG
v0.3.0</a>. The main focus
of this release was to get some searching added to the application. Similar
to what I added to <a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">WEG</a> back in the day, I
wanted three types of searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current entry search.</li>
<li>Current guide-wide search.</li>
<li>All registered guides-wide search.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current entry search is done with a simple modal input, and for now the
searching is always case-insensitive (I was going to add a switch for this
but it sort of felt unnecessary and I liked how clean the input is).</p>
<p><img alt="Entry search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search.png"></p>
<p>The search is started by pressing <kbd>/</kbd>, and if a hit is found
<kbd>n</kbd> will take you through all subsequent matches.</p>
<p>As always, if you're not sure of the keys, you'll find them in the help
screen or via the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="Looking up search in the command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search-palette.png"></p>
<p>Guide-wide and all-guide searching is done in the same dialog. To search
guide-wide you enter what you want to find and untick <em>"All Guides"</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Setting up a guide search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-setup.png"></p>
<p>With that, the search will stick to the current guide.</p>
<p><img alt="Guide-wide search running" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-running.png"></p>
<p>As will be obvious, searching all guides that have been registered with
AgiNG is as simple as ticking <em>"All Guides"</em>. Then when you search it'll
take a walk through every entry of every guide you've added to the guide
directory in the application.</p>
<p><img alt="Gide-wide searching" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-search.gif#centre"></p>
<p>Global searching is accessed with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/<kbd> or via the
command palette.</p>
<p><img alt="Finding global search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/global-palette.png"></p>
<p>With this added, I think that's most of the major functionality I wanted for
AgiNG. I imagine there's a few more tweaks I'll think of (for example: I
think adding regex search to the global search screen could be handy), but I
don't think there's any more big features it needs.</p>
<p>AgiNG can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>aging</code>:</p>

<p>It seems I really do still have this need to create new terminal-based
projects at the moment. There's been
<a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">Braindrop</a>, then
<a href="/2025/01/25/peplum.html">Peplum</a>, then after that came
<a href="/2025/02/14/hike.html">Hike</a>. While I'm still tweaking and adding to them,
and also using them to refine <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced">a wee library I'm building up that forms the
core of my latest apps</a>, I felt I
still had this one app that I <em>needed</em> to finally build.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s I've had this mild obsession with <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">building tools for
maintaining access to Norton Guide
files</a>. I've written readers for
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg">GNU/Linux (which also works on macOS too)</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2">OS/2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el">GNU
Emacs</a>, and also or the web (in multiple
incarnations). Those builds have covered a few languages, including C, C++,
Pascal, JavaScript and Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>I'd never written a Python library or application for it though.</p>
<p>So when I first saw Textual mentioned in passing on Twitter a few years
back, way back in the 0.1 days, I thought that could be the thing that would
push me over the edge. In anticipation of that, back in 2021, I initially
developed <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/"><code>ngdb.py</code></a>. This is a library
that provides the core Norton Guide reading code for Python applications and
could form the basis for other tools.</p>
<p>As a test for this I then wrote <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web"><code>ng2web</code></a>
(which works, but I think still needs a bit of tidying up -- something I'm
aiming to do in the next few weeks).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the journey with Textual itself <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">kicked
off</a>, happened, and <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">came to an
end</a>; and yet somehow I'd never got
round to building the thing I'd initially looked at Textual for: a
terminal-based Norton Guide reader that looked nice and modern (by terminal
standards). When I initially joined Textualize the owner had actually said
they wanted me to build this as test of the framework, to essentially start
out by employing me to create some Free Software that would help dogfood the
library, but that seemed to get forgotten.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of this month and I finally felt it was time to
tackle this. The result is <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging">AgiNG</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-dark.png"></p>
<p>As of v0.1.0 it has most of the features you'd expect from a usable Norton
Guide reader, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ability to add guide files to an in-application directory.</li>
<li>The ability open and navigate a guide.</li>
<li>Full see-also support, etc.</li>
<li>Full translation of characters as were under MS-DOS into the terminal.</li>
<li>The ability to copy entry text or source to the clipboard.</li>
<li>The ability to copy save entry text or source to a file.</li>
<li>Access to a guide's credits.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AgiNG showing a long entry" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-long-entry.png"></p>
<p>I still need to write some proper documentation for the application, but
meanwhile all commands and key shortcuts can be discovered either via the
help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG help" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-help-screen.png"></p>
<p>or by pulling up the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>Hopefully the workings of the application will be fairly obvious to anyone
who is familiar with Norton Guide files; if anything isn't making sense <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/q-a">I'm
more than happy to answer
questions</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/ideas">take suggestions for
improvements</a>.</p>
<p>One wee feature I want to call out, that I felt was important to add, was a
"classic view" facility. The thing with Norton Guide files is they were
mostly created in the very late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s. People would
often get creative with the colouring within them, but in many cases the
colouring assumed the default Norton Guide application. Its colours were
white text on a blue background. So sometimes other colouring was done
assuming that background.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this here, with an entry in a guide being viewed
using the default <code>textual-dark</code> theme:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in textual-dark" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/textual-dark.png"></p>
<p>Notice the colouring in the syntax section. This is more obvious if the
application is switched to one of the light themes:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in solarized-light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/solarized-light.png"></p>
<p>With a nod to this issue in mind, I added the "classic view" for entries
(which is a sticky setting -- turn it on and it stays on until you turn it
off):</p>
<p><img alt="Classic view in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/classic-view.png"></p>
<p>A little hard on the eyes, I think, but also filled with nostalgia!</p>
<p>Talking of themes, all the usual application themes are available, here's a
wee selection:</p>
<p><img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-nord.png">
<img alt="Textual Light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-light.png">
<img alt="Gruvbox" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-gruvbox.png">
<img alt="Solarize Light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-solarized-light.png">
<img alt="Monokai" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-monokai.png"></p>
<p>AgiNG is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>aging
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>aging</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>aging
</code></pre></div>

<p>Expect to see more updates in the near future; as with other recent projects
this is very much something I'm going to be dabbling with and improving as
time goes on.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Like many programmers, I have a couple of "Hello, World" projects that I've
carried with me over the years. One is 5x5 (which has been used to get to
grips with things as diverse as the Palm Pilot and GNU emacs). Another
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides">Norton Guides database</a>
<a href="http://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">readers</a>.</p>
<p>I've made Norton Guides tools that have allowed web servers to serve guides
(<code>w3ng</code>), that have allowed you to convert guides to HTML (<code>ng2html</code>), that
have let you read guides on OS/2 and GNU/Linux (<code>eg</code>) and also have let you
read guides in Microsoft Windows (<code>weg</code>). It's a problem I know fairly well
and one where I know the solution well enough so I can concentrate on
learning the new language or environment.</p>
<p>Recently I wanted to get to grips with some
"pure" <a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ES6</a> coding while also getting
to know <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>. A new version of the Norton Guide
code, written for this environment, seemed like a good thing to do.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG">jsNG</a> was born.</p>
<p>At its core is <a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG/tree/master/lib">a library of code for opening and reading data from Norton
Guides databases</a>. While I
doubt it's good ES6 code, or even good node.js code, it's been very useful
in giving me a fun problem to solve and it'll carry on being something I'll
tweak and tinker with by way of trying new things out.</p>
<p>On top of this I've built a handful of tools for working with Norton Guides
databases. The most useful one at the moment (the others are more in the
"test the library" than the "make something handy with the library"
category) is <code>ngserve</code>. This is designed as a simple Norton Guides database
HTTP server.</p>
<p><img alt="ngserve in action" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.10.18.png"></p>
<p>When run, you give it a list of guides to serve:</p>
<p><img alt="Starting ngserve" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.26.44.png"></p>
<p>and it does the right thing. It has a small number of command line options
that help configure what it does:</p>
<p><img alt="ngserve command line options" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.29.28.png"></p>
<p>Possibly the most useful are the ones that let you change how it handles
"higher" DOS characters and, if you don't like the default colours and
stuff, the option that lets you point to your own style sheet (note for now
you'll need to host the stylesheet somewhere else -- ngserve won't serve it
for you; I'm aiming to change that in some way in the near future).</p>
<p>jsNG does have a fairly basic design compromise at its heart. In the very
early version I started out using the async functions for opening and
reading the guides. This got very tedious very quickly and I could see that
it was going to make for a very messy library with a very messy interface.
While it might not be in the spirit of node.js programming I decided to go
with the sync version of the file IO functions and code up the core library
based around this.</p>
<p>This approach also means that I took another leap that I never have done
with Norton Guides before: rather than doing the traditional thing of
keeping an open handle into them and reading direct from the file as you
navigate the guide, I simply read it all into a buffer in one go and keep it
in memory. This is a "guides are small, memory is cheap, things will go
faster" approach.</p>
<p>It does mean that when you load up a load of guides into <code>ngserve</code> they're
all sat in memory. The upside of this is that things should be a lot faster
and the code is a lot easier to follow (I think). To put this in some
perspective: I have a directory here that contains 110 Norton Guides files.
They total 36M in size. If that seems like a lot of stuff to hold in
memory... remind me how much is being used by your web browser so you can
look at some hilarious kittens. ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, that's where I'm at with it right now. The code is mostly settled
and mostly tidy. I need to write up some documentation for it (and so I need
to take a look at good JavaScript documentation tools) and perhaps tinker
with <code>ngserve</code> a little more. I'd also like to do a new version of <code>ng2html</code>
with this -- a version that makes it <em>far</em> easier to control the style of
the output. I'm also tempted to do a CLI-based reader in pure ES6; something
similar to <code>EG</code> or <code>WEG</code>.</p>
<p>All in good time.</p></div>
