  <div>
      <div><p>A little earlier this evening I got <a href="https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/issues/7">a new
issue</a> raised against
<a href="(https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/issues/7)"><code>boxquote.el</code></a>. Apparently
Emacs 29 (I'm running 28.1 as of the time of writing) is moaning about the
likes of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">setf</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">point</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">some-location-or-other</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">setf</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">buffer-string</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There's a whole background to why I've tended to code like that, that stems
from enjoying Common Lisp, my days reading (and sometimes posting to)
<code>comp.lang.lisp</code>, and I <em>think</em> some of the stuff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Naggum">Erik
Naggum</a> wrote back in the day. I
won't get into it all now; I'm not sure I can even remember a lot of how I
got there given how far back it was.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Wanting to quickly get to the bottom of why the above was suddenly an issue,
I dived into the <code>NEWS</code> file and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/67a15ce1564ce35ece24a19f00e03a36e0575746/etc/NEWS#L2585">found the

</code></pre></div>

<p>As suggested above... this is my thing, this is how I coded some Elisp
stuff. Look through much of my <a href="https://elisp.dev/">Emacs Lisp code</a> and
you'll find me <code>setf</code>ing stuff all over the place.</p>
<p>Apparently my style is "obscure". Actually, I'm kinda okay with that if I'm
honest.</p>
<p>This is going to be a bit of a pain in the arse; I'm going to have to go
through a whole bunch of code and make it "less obscure", at some point.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>This isn't the part that had me thinking I must be getting old. Oh no. The
<code>NEWS</code> file had another little surprise in store:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">**</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">The</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">quickurl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">library</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">now</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">obsolete</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">Use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="nx">abbrev</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="nx">skeleton</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">or</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="nx">tempo</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">instead</span><span class="p">.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That.... that's me that is. Well, it's one of the me things. If you run
<code>about-emacs</code>, dive into <code>Authors</code>, and search for my name, in any copy of
GNU Emacs from the last decade or two, you'll find this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Dave Pearson: wrote 5x5.el quickurl.el
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/quickurl.el/blob/master/quickurl.el"><code>quickurl.el</code></a>
was a package I wrote back in the late 1990s, back when I was a very heavy
user of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>, and often found
myself posting the same URLs in posts again and again; especially in
<code>comp.lang.clipper</code>. As a fairly quick hack I wrote the code so that I could
very quickly insert often-used URLs.</p>
<p>Some time later, I got an email from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">FSF</a> (I actually
think it was from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">RMS</a> --
but that's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox"><code>mbox</code></a> I've long ago
lost -- or a backup of it might be in storage back in England, on a DVD),
asking if I wanted to contribute it to Emacs proper. This seemed like an odd
thing to add to Emacs but, sure, why the hell not?</p>
<p>And so I had my second contribution to a body of code I used a lot (the
first being <a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.el"><code>5x5.el</code></a> -- which itself was
my first ever attempt at writing some non-trivial Elisp code).</p>
<p>So... yeah... here we are. I'm now old enough to have written some Emacs
Lisp code, had it required by the FSF for inclusion in Emacs, had it live in
there for something like two decades, and then <em>become obselete</em>!</p></div>

      Posted on 2020-06-14 20:00 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/emacs.html">Emacs</a>

    </p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Ever since the whole business of "light mode" and "dark mode" really kicked
off in the mobile OS world, I've been a fan of the dark modes. On both
Android and iOS/iPadOS, when apps became available with dark modes, I'd
switch to it. When the operating systems themselves adopted the switch,
that's what I went for. As well as having a love for all things black
(anyone who knows me personally will know that), I think it just looks
better on mobile devices. I can't quite say why, but it just works best for
me.</p>
<p>So, when macOS got a supported dark mode, I instantly switched it on,
obviously. Then, within a day, I switched it back to light mode.
Surprisingly it just didn't work for me, and I wasn't sure why. Since then
I've tried living with it a few times and it's rarely lasted more than a few
hours. There was something, something I couldn't quite put my finger on,
that didn't sit right.</p>
<p>Last Monday I decided to give it another go. This time, however, I thought
I'd figured it out. The "problem" was Emacs! As mentioned <a href="/2020/01/11/where-i-live-and-work.html">back in
January</a>,
for as long as I've used it (so since the mid-1990s), my Emacs has always
had a light background -- probably because that's how it came "out of the
box" (I'm talking Emacs in graphical mode here; I started with it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#1994%E2%80%931996:_The_%22Warp%22_years">OS/2
Warp</a>
and then moved to a GNU/Linux X-based desktop). I figured that the contrast
between the colour scheme of Emacs, and the rest of the machine, was the
issue here.</p>
<p>I spend most of my working day either in Emacs, or in
<a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> -- often rapidly switching between the
two. I've always run iTerm2 in the usual dark background mode with light
text. So I figured the problem was having a dark OS desktop, dark terminal,
and then a light editing environment. Eventually that'd feel wrong.</p>
<p>So I decided that, for the first time in about 25 years, I should give Emacs
a go with a dark mode. Taking a quick look at <a href="https://pawelbx.github.io/emacs-theme-gallery/">popular dark
themes</a> I noticed
<a href="https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow"><code>sanityinc-tomorrow-night</code></a>
looked easy on the eye, so I gave that a go (actually, I gave each of the
themes in that set a go, <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/commit/07f1c4c4c8c0c476f1e5e34845a834956d2be0c4">initially starting with
<code>sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties</code></a>,
but I finally settled on <code>sanityinc-tomorrow-night</code>).</p>
<p>To start with it didn't look too good; not because of a problem with the
theme itself, but because, over time, I'd made changes and tweaks to my
setup that assumed I'd be using my usual light theme. After some dabbling
and tinkering and trying things out, I got it looking "just so".</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-06-14 at 19.40.43.png" src="/attachments/2020/06/14/Screenshot 2020-06-14 at 19.40.43.png"></p>
<p>Having got that working, I then thought it would be nice to be able to have
Emacs -- at least on restart -- adapt to me switching between dark and light
mode on macOS. It turns out that detecting if macOS is in dark mode is easy
enough, the command <code>defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle</code> will emit <code>Dark</code>
if in dark mode. So, knowing that, I updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/is-a.el/blob/2b3eb99a213454536d789325f01477e3ce7eec87/is-a.el#L67-L70">my personal package for
checking things about the environment that Emacs is in to use that
information</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defconst</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">is-a-macOS-dark-mode-window-p</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">and</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="nv">is-a-macOS-window-p</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">string=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">shell-command-to-string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Dark\n&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;Are we running in a macOS window in dark mode?&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, as of now, my Emacs setup is such that, <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/f8389ac8f93b66c614ef82705929b86f01efc130/init.d/init-style.el#L15-L24">if I'm in graphical mode on
macOS and I'm in dark mode, Emacs will use a dark theme, otherwise it'll do
what it did before -- with a light background in a graphical mode and a more
Borland-a-like blue background when in CHUI
mode</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to have made a difference. Almost one week on my work Macbook is
still in dark mode, and I've switched both of my personal Macbooks, and my
iMac, into dark mode too. I think it's sticking this time. Next up is to
give some serious consideration to darkening the web in general. Only now am
I noticing just how damn bright most of it is!</p>
<hr>
<p>As a slight aside to the above, I've also made one other change to Emacs:
I've finally dropped the display of scroll bars. In the themes I'm using
they didn't look so great, appearing to be distracting. For the past 25
years I've had the scrollbars there, but never actually <em>used</em> them; all
they've ever done is serve as a visual aid to where I am in a file. Thing
is, I'm not sure I ever really pay that much attention to that either. So,
as a test, I've also been running with them turned off and, so far, I'm
really not noticing them been gone.</p>
<p>The habits we form that we convince ourselves make sense...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>When I started with this version of the blog on Hashnode<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, my plan was to
try and write something at least once a week. I managed to do that as far as
January this year, give or take, but then things got a little busy, the
world got trickier, and... Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">you don't need me to tell you about
that</a>. Anyway, I'm back to
write some more and, hopefully, try and keep up with writing. I feel it'll
do me good.</p>
<p>I have been busy since January. Work has, as far as possible, carried on as
normal. The only big difference being I'm back working from home. It's an
odd turn of events personally given that I'd worked from home for 21 years,
then (with some trepidation) <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">went back to working in an
office</a>. Having got used to being in
an office and being around people, it took some adjusting to working alone
again.</p>
<p>So, on to the main point of this post... During that period I've spent a lot
more time at my machine than I would normally, and so it was inevitable that
I'd end up tinkering with <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d">my Emacs
configuration</a>. While it's true that
<a href="/2019/11/23/visual-evolution-of-emacs-config.html">there's hardly a week goes by where I don't tinker with some small
thing</a>, I try not to make
huge changes too often. Huge changes do happen though.</p>
<p>A handful of weeks back was another one of those times where I made a big
change.</p>
<p>After I <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">burnt my original <code>~/.emacs</code> file back in
2016</a> I've had an approach
where I've tried to make things as modular as possible, and as easy to clone
down to a new machine as possible. The design I came up with, <a href="/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html">especially
once I moved over to using
<code>use-package</code></a>, has
served me well. But there was always one thing that bothered me: the files
that handled the loading and configuration of packages were, in effect,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/tree/728e74376bf5606d9ef2d297e36cc2d35e159d64/init.d/packages">still three large monolithic
files</a>.
While this was better than a single monolithic <code>~/.emacs</code>, it still didn't
feel quite right.</p>
<p>Giving it a bit of thought, I decided that what I really wanted was a single
directory in which I could drop lots of small <code>.el</code> files that would handle
the loading and configuration of all sorts of packages. While it didn't gain
anything concrete, the idea felt tidier. Tidy is good. Feeling like the code
smell is good, is good too.</p>
<p>First though I needed a way to load multiple files, ideally within a whole
directory hierarchy, without needing to know in advance what files would be
there. After a little bit of tinkering I settled on <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/c3d53152b1adc9ba5e43baddb986870b3244b113/init.d/init-packages.el#L42-L46">this bit of
code</a>
that revolves around the use of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Contents-of-Directories.html"><code>directory-files-recursively</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">expand-file-name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;init.d/packages.d/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">user-emacs-directory</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">file-exists-p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cl-loop</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">directory-files-recursively</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rx</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.el&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">             </span><span class="nb">do</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">load</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file-name-sans-extension</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">use</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Simply put, this code finds every file in and below
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/tree/master/init.d/packages.d"><code>~/.emacs.d/init.d/packages.d/</code></a>
whose name ends in <code>.el</code> (note the use of a regular expression, using
<a href="/2019/12/01/being-phony-and-lispy-regular-expressions.html"><code>rx</code></a>
to create it), removes the extension from the name, and loads it with <code>load</code>
(dropping the extension means <code>load</code> can decide if it wants to load the
compiled version of the code, or the source, depending on what's available).</p>
<p>After writing that I could then start to populate
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.d/packages.d/</code> with lots of smaller files that handled the
loading of packages. In some cases there's a file just for one package, in
other cases there's a file that handles a logical grouping of packages
(where there are obvious direct dependencies, or where one package is
designed to extend the other, etc). For now I've decided to break things
down into three directories that map to the three monolithic files I had
before:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-06-07 at 16.36.28.png" src="/attachments/2020/06/07/Screenshot 2020-06-07 at 16.36.28.png"></p>
<p>However, I'm not totally wedded to this design and I may change this as time
goes on.</p>
<p>While I've not spent any time properly testing it out, I've also not really
noticed any obvious impact on startup speed. However, this tends not to be a
real concern for me. I seldom <em>start</em> Emacs anyway. I always have it running
<a href="https://github.com/davep/e">and use <code>emacsclient</code> as my editor in most places so files open instantly
in the running version of Emacs</a>.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Late on last year I stumbled on an article about
<a href="https://www.getdnote.com/">dnote</a>. Annoyingly, I can't recall now where I
saw it, but I made a reminder to look at it over my Christmas break.</p>
<p>Dnote looked like a tool that would fill a hole I had in how I work. When it
comes to making notes about things, and keeping things for future reference,
I use a few tools, each one being just right (for me) for the job in
question. I use <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> to track documents and
other household type things. I use <a href="https://www.google.com/keep/">Keep</a> to
make notes about stuff I need to remember short-term (say, the size of a
space in my bedroom that I want furniture to go in) and also to record notes
while in meetings at work. I use <a href="https://journey.cloud/">Journey</a> to keep a
journal about... anything, really. Finally, <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep">I use
Pinboard</a> to keep hold of URLs I might want to
go back to (I also use it to create a to-read list).</p>
<p>Amongst all of this, however, I felt I was missing something for keeping
track of things that don't really fall into any of the categories above.
Mostly this would be work-based or hacking-based things that are short and
sweet but I don't always use enough to easily remember. I wanted just the
right tool that would let me ferret away useful one-liners, remind myself of
obscure switches that get used once or twice a year, etc.</p>
<p>After reading up on dnote it seemed pretty clear that this was just such a
tool.</p>
<p>After getting back to the office at the start of this month I decided to
make use of it and see how it went. My idea was simple: I'd record any "TIL"
stuff that I might want to remember in the future, as well as recording
things I need now and again but can't always remember.</p>
<p>So far it's working quite well. I like that it has a simple CLI. I like that
it's got a backend that you can use to sync between different machines. I
like that it's got a web interface that's mobile-friendly. I like that <a href="https://github.com/dnote/dnote">it's
Free Software</a> and so you can host your own
server if you wish.</p>
<p>I found I liked it enough that, of course, I felt the need to start <a href="https://github.com/davep/dnote.el">a
simple Emacs wrapper for the CLI</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment dnote.el is designed to be a simple capture system. There are
commands for capturing a one-liner (entered in the Emacs mini-buffer), for
capturing the content of the current buffer, and for capturing
freshly-entered multi-line text, entered in a buffer that uses
<code>markdown-mode</code>. There's also a command for syncing notes if you have
configured dnote to talk to a backend.</p>
<p>What I don't have right now is the ability to navigate and view notes. So
far I've not really felt the need for that because the CLI approach works so
well. Longer-term though I can see my tweaking this and adding in commands
for searching, viewing, editing and deleting notes.</p>
<p>But, for now, if you've not had a look at dnote, I'd highly recommend having
a play and seeing if it makes sense for you. And, if it does, and you're an
Emacs user, perhaps dnote.el will be useful too?</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's no surprise that I spend a lot of time in Emacs. Especially when I'm
developing software, either for work or for personal fun, most of my time is
time spent in Emacs. While I do obviously flit over to Chrome, and mostly do
my CLI stuff in <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> (I really like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">eshell</a>
but it just can't replace a good terminal for me), I spend a lot of time
looking at Emacs.</p>
<p>Here's what my Emacs looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 13.49.04.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 13.49.04.png"></p>
<p>Key elements for me are as follows:</p>
<h1>Light background</h1>
<p>Something I've never really got on with when it comes to code editing is
dark themes and dark backgrounds. I find it too much of an eye strain.
Oddly, I tend to prefer dark themes everywhere else, but not when it comes
to working in Emacs. The theme I use is <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/init-style.el#L12-L13">the built-in adwaita
theme</a>.</p>
<h1>Less boring mode line</h1>
<p>I make use of <a href="https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline">powerline</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L386-L399">make the mode line a bit less
boring-looking</a>.
While the colour scheme is such that it's kept in line with the light look,
the style is nice in that it sort of matches the style of prompt I use in my
shell.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.05.39.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.05.39.png"></p>
<h1>Full screen</h1>
<p>I always run Emacs as a full-screen application, then splitting it into
different tiled windows using its own internal window handling. This is
something I've done from way back when I got started with my first GNU/Linux
desktop machine, and still like to do on macOS.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el">run Emacs as a server</a> and
then use <a href="https://github.com/davep/e">a little wrapper around <code>emacsclient</code></a>
to open files (both locally and remotely) from the command line in that
Emacs session.</p>
<h1>Comfortable eshell when I need it</h1>
<p>Although I say above that I generally don't use <code>eshell</code>, preferring to use
a full-featured terminal application, in combination with
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>, I do sometimes dip into eshell for quick
things. So of course I have that configured to feel comfortable too.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.10.07.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.10.07.png"></p>
<p>I do this easily <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L181-L192">thanks to

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Both at work and at home I use Emacs by <a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el">keeping a copy running all the
time</a>, and use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server"><code>emacsclient</code> to open
files inside
it</a>
(including on remote machines thanks to a bit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><code>ssh</code></a> and heavy use of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/"><code>tramp</code></a> -- I might write this up at
some point). This works really well, but does mean I tend to build up a lot
of buffers over time.</p>
<p>Having lots of buffers open isn't generally an issue, and if I'm working on
lots of different files in a project during the course of a hacking session
it's actually a good thing. But, quite often, I want to tidy up the buffer
list, clearing it back to near-zero buffers open. Many years ago, when I had
a "proper" tower system running 24/7, with Emacs open all the time, I'd use
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MidnightMode"><code>clean-buffer-list</code> as part of
<code>midnight</code></a>. Along the way
that fell out of favour with me, likely because I drifted into using
machines that had Emacs open all the time but where the machine wasn't awake
all the time.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to have some fun rolling my own solution, and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el"><code>nuke-buffers</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>Rather than try and do things in an automated way, this was designed to be
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/ffc863ca0fb669d2f6639bda62e81764c35767ce/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L98-L107">bound to a key (or
two)</a>
and then be run when I wanted, being as harsh as possible about cleaning up
the buffer list. Since first writing it it's worked well for me.</p>
<p>These days I tend to let the buffer list build up as I work on a new
feature, or chase down a bug, etc. Then, once I've made the final commit for
that period of focus, I'll hit the <code>nuke-buffer</code> key combo as the final act
of confirming that I've done the job. So not only does this help tidy my
Emacs session a bit, it also feels like a physical form of punctuation --
back in less sensible days, when I had some terrible habits, it would have
been when I'd reach for the celebratory cigarette; buffer-tidying feels far
more wholesome. ;)</p>
<p>The way the code works is, of course, mostly directed at how I work -- it's
highly likely it wouldn't make sense for many other people. The main aim is
to kill as many buffers as possible, but without disturbing anything else.
The list of buffers it gathers for nuking avoids buffers that are <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L60-L62">visiting
files but have unsaved
content</a>,
avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L54">the
minibuffer</a>
(obviously), avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L56">any "special"
buffer</a>
(one that starts with a space then an asterisk), avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L73">the current
buffer</a>
and also avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L58">any buffer in a list of names to
avoid</a>.</p>
<p>I've being using this on a daily basis for around 2.5 years now and it's
done the job without ever losing me any work.</p></div>

      <div><p>While it does seem that they're a little out of fashion these days, in some
circles anyway, I'm still an avid fan of <code>make</code> and make files. Even in
environments where I don't need a <code>Makefile</code> to actually build anything,
I'll use one (or more) to help create handy shortcuts for getting stuff
done.</p>
<p>Looking at the main <code>Makefile</code> for one of my major work projects, there's 45
targets that help fire off various jobs (all of them <a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html">self-documenting using
a variation on an approach I read a while
back</a>).</p>
<p>In most cases the targets aren't real targets. That's to say, they don't
build the thing they're called. They are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html">phony
targets</a>.
So, as makes sense, I make a point of marking them all as such. I follow the
convention that has the <code>.PHONY</code> marker appear on the line before the
target; this feels cleaner to me and easier to follow and maintain.</p>
<p>But.... I'm lazy. And I use Emacs. Typing out <code>.PHONY foo</code> all the time
feels like far too much work. So, some time ago, I quickly threw together
<a href="https://github.com/davep/make-phony.el"><code>make-phony.el</code></a>.</p>
<p>With this I could be <em>really</em> lazy. I could type out the <code>Makefile</code> target
and then, with my cursor on it, press a key combination and have the
<code>.PHONY</code> marker put in place.</p>
<p>Does it save much time? Yeah, probably not really. But it was a fun little
exercise and an excuse to write a little bit of Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>There's one thing I made a point of doing in the heart of this too: using
<code>rx</code>. For anyone who doesn't know of it, think of it as a very Lispy way of
writing regular expressions. I won't even try and explain it all here
<a href="http://francismurillo.github.io/2017-03-30-Exploring-Emacs-rx-Macro/">because others have done an excellent job
already</a>.
What I will do is say this: if you're in the habit of writing some Emacs
Lisp, or even tinkering with your configuration, and you find yourself
writing a regular expression, consider looking at <code>rx</code> -- it's well worth
the time to get to know it.</p>
<p>Slowly, as time goes on, I'm weeding out "vanilla" regular expressions from
my config and code and moving over to using <code>rx</code>. I feel, quite rightly I
think, that <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b3185a1dbaa0a16f540465844b84c5e1c6a77180/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L117-L126">something like
this</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rx</span>
<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">or</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; Ignore hidden files.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">bol</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; I never want to edit the desktop.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Desktop/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; Ignore compiled files.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">or</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;pyc&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;elc&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.egg-info/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is much easier to write, read and maintain, than this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;\\(^\\.\\)\\|\\(Desktop/$\\)\\|\\(\\.\\(?:\\(?:\\(?:el\\|py\\)c\\)\\)$\\)\\|\\(\\.egg-info/$\\)&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>I mean, even <em>if</em> the regular expression above can be written in a more
efficient way (and I imagine it can), as someone working in a Lisp
environment, I'd much sooner write and work with the <code>rx</code> version.</p></div>

      <div><p>At the start of this month <a href="/2019/11/02/emacsconf-2019.html">I spent a very enjoyable Saturday afternoon
watching EmacsConf 2019</a>. If you missed it,
or even if you didn't, you might like to know that <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacsconf-discuss/2019-11/msg00002.html">the announcement has
gone out</a>
that almost all of the videos are <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/videos">now available for
watching</a>.</p>
<p>While I mean nothing negative about any other video, I think the two that
stand out the most for me, in terms of things that grabbed my interest, were
<a href="https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/08.html"><em>How a Completely Blind Manager/Dev Uses Emacs Every
Day</em></a> and <a href="https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/15.html"><em>Emacs as my Go To
Script Language</em></a>.</p>
<p>I seem to recall that both those talks were hit with technical issues (many
talks on the day were -- part of the enjoyment for me was how the whole
conference was an experiment in using Free Software to host the whole
thing), but they're well worth a watch despite this.</p>
<p>If you have any sort of interest in Emacs I'd highly recommend dipping into
the whole collection.</p>
<p>I really hope there's going to be a 2020 EmacsConf.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As detailed in a blog post I wrote <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">back in
2016</a>, I first got into
using Emacs in the mid 1990s, starting with it on OS/2 and then moving over
to GNU/Linux. It's been my often-used and much-loved development environment
for most of those years (I even have a couple of packages that are part of
Emacs itself).</p>
<p>For most of that time my configuration was a single <code>~/.emacs</code> file, which
was around 1,000 lines in length (including comments and whitespace). It'd
grown over the years, having special configuration sections for versions of
Emacs I didn't use any more, and operating systems I didn't work on any more
(yes, really, there were things in there specific to MS-DOS, for example).
On top of that I always hand-installed packages I used -- Emacs' package
management system having turned up long after I first got into using Emacs.</p>
<p>Then, in early 2016, I decided to nuke the whole thing and start from
scratch. As mentioned above, the start of this <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">is detailed in an older
post</a>. Another big round of
changes <a href="/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html">happened round a year
later</a> -- which included
the birth of <a href="http://blog.davep.org/delpa/">delpa</a> to manage my personal
packages. A couple or so months later there was <a href="/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html">one last big round of
changes</a>, mostly killing
off my enthusiastic embracing of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization"><code>customize</code></a>
and instead going back to hand-set settings, only this time done via
<a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package"><code>use-package</code></a>.</p>
<p>The full history of this <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d">can be found over on
GitHub</a>, starting with the first "throw
everything away and start again" process and all the steps between then and
where my Emacs configuration is now.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the fun part of this blog post. Earlier this week I
stumbled on <a href="https://gource.io/">Gource</a>. It's a tool that's primarily
designed to visualise changes in repositories, although it can be used to
visualise anything that has a tree structure and changes over time (this
week I produced a video of the growth of my employer's electronic lab
notebook by hooking up the <a href="https://www.benchling.com/">Benchling</a> API with
Gource, for example). So I got curious. What did it look like as I reworked
and tweaked and changed and tinkered with my Emacs configuration?</p>
<p>This is what it looked like:</p>

      <div><p>For anyone who doesn't know, today is the day for <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/">EmacsConf
2019</a>. As you might gather from the name, it's
a conference all about Emacs, the joys of Emacs, Emacs Lisp and other
Emacs-related things.</p>
<p>Better still, it's an online conference (although there do appear to be a
couple of related physical gatherings around the world).</p>
<p>I've got snacks and drinks in and no plans for my Saturday, and I hope to
follow the whole thing from start to finish.</p>
<p>If Emacs is your thing, or knowing more about Emacs is your thing, be sure
to check it out!</p></div>
