  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html">just over a week
back</a>, last night I went to see a
Fringe show that was a production of <em>The Little Shop of Horrors</em>. Before
going I had no idea what to expect (in terms of how it would be done, not
what the content would be): I wasn't clear if it would be a really small
affair, or something on a bigger stage with reasonably high production
values (what can I say? It was LSoH, it was a Fringe show, it was booked
knowing nothing else).</p>
<p>When we got there and got into the venue it was... small, oh so very small!
No real set to speak of. The cast who were about to kick off the performance
didn't really seem to have much of a costume going on. So, without
judgement, I settled down to expect the next 90 minutes or so to be... a
Fringe experience.</p>
<p>First impressions were oh so wrong! While there was (for obvious reasons) a
lack of any real set, the effort that went into the performance really
worked and I absolutely enjoyed every single moment. Also, because it was a
production of the musical (which I haven't seen), rather than an adaption of
the movie (which I have), I got to experience a fresh ending (spoilers!).</p>
<p>The seats were uncomfortable. The room was down in the basement, with no
ventilation, and so was uncomfortably hot. Physically it wasn't a great
space to be. And yet I really wasn't wishing for it to be over. I think that
says a lot about the show itself.</p>
<p>I think special mention has to be given to the Audrey II models, of which
there were three different sizes. Someone put some real effort into them.</p>
<p>So, yeah, a fun night, topped and tailed with pre-show dinner and post-show
drinks with friends. I couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>Unless I last-moment book anything else over the next week, <a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html">there's one
more show to go</a> in my <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">push to go
and see at least one show per week of the
Fringe</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Sadly no photos. I wasn't sat in a great spot to take photos.</p></div>

      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">about a week back</a>,
my first show booked for this year's Edinburgh Fringe was to see <a href="https://harperspace.com/home">Nick
Harper</a>. It's been a long time since I've seen
him; far too long. As best as I can tell the last gig I made it to was in
2009.</p>
<p>Fourteen years. Shit's changed in that time, for me, for the world. O_o</p>
<p>On first getting into town it was warm and crowded, with that fun "town is
doing festival shit" vibe that I like, so I went and grabbed an ice cream to
kill some time until the venue opened. I knew I was in the right spot when,
as I stood on Chambers Street, enjoying the cooldown, the man himself dashed
passed, guitar case in hand!</p>
<p>When I got into the venue I grabbed a drink and tried to find a seat; most
were taken; except for one right at the front and off to the side. So I
grabbed it. Moments later Nick himself came over to say hello to the folk
sat in this spot. We had a wee chat about how long it was since I'd last
seen him, nattered about general stuff, and he said very nice things about
my hat.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2682.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>The gig itself was fantastic. While I love his recorded work anyway, Nick's
always been one of those artists who I enjoy most live. He's got this way of
singing and playing guitar that fills whatever time he's got to play; never
once have I ever found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it's near
the end; or if I have it's because I'm worried it'll be over soon.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2684.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>A good number of the tracks he played I didn't recognise; at least two of
them I know are from a new album that's coming, and I have to admit that
when I do listen to his stuff it's the earlier works that tend to go into
heavy rotation (I think the last album of his I bought was <em>The Last
Guitar</em>). But I loved everything I got to hear. I'll be diving back into
<a href="https://harperspace.com/shop">his catalogue</a> and also keeping an eye out
for the new release.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2689.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>While there was only an hour for his slot, he did manage to get a couple of
old favourites of mine in; I was delighted when he launched into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQAebSpqVw">By My
Rocket Comes Fire</a>, did a
wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH6TqeeM5ZY">She Rules My World</a>,
and even squeezed in a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yz7mQ_i6pg">Galaxy
Song</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2705.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>All too quickly though, the hour was up. It was kind of fitting that many of
the songs he did have on the set list were all about time (on purpose, I'm
sure). I'm happy to say I got to say a quick thank you and goodbye and then
it was time for me to head out of town again.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2701.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Seeing Nick brought back a lot of good memories, and reminded me that I need
to catch up on his more recent works. While most of his stuff doesn't seem
to be on Apple Music (what can I say, I'm very online these days when it
comes to music), I'm glad to see <a href="https://nickharper.bandcamp.com/">he's got a full
Bandcamp</a>, so I'll be paying that a visit!</p>
<p>I hope he swings back this way some time soon, not during the Fringe, and
with a proper long set. It's been too long since I got to enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTD03-3qgmg">him really
going for it and having a ton of
fun</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)">Little Shop of
Horrors</a> for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.</p>
<p>And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.</p>
<p>Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.</p>
<p>So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="Poser for Little Shop of Horrors" src="/attachments/2023/08/10/IMG_2652.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would</a>, this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you <em>seen</em> how much there is on offer?).</p>
<p>So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors">a performance of Little Shop of
Horrors</a>.</p></div>

<p>I've lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside
form the odd show here and there, I've never really <em>done</em> the Fringe. As
in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn't quite
allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every
year I've been up here I've managed one show, at least, but this year I want
to try and make myself get to a few.</p>
<p>Maybe one per week. Possibly.</p>
<p>Might not happen, but I'm going to try. What can I say? I don't live <em>in</em>
Edinburgh, I'm not a big "be out amongst people" kind of person, and the
activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little
part of Scotland is a constant battle.</p>
<p>But this year I'm going to try my best.</p>
<p>This evening I've booked a ticket for an artist I've been a fan of since the
1990s: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harper">Nick Harper</a>. I saw Nick
quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I <em>think</em> 2009 might be
the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat
(again, life stuff). So seeing that <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/5-nights-in-harperspace">he's playing here for a few
days</a> was
something I could not ignore.</p>
<p>This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something
kinda sociable. I'm sure he'll be mad at me most of the day it's happening,
but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he'll be thankful.</p>
<p>Right now, at this moment... I'm rather looking forward to it.</p></div>
