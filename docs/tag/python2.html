  <div>
      <div><p>Over the past year and a half I've written a <em>lot</em> of Python code, and a lot
of that Python code has been Textual applications; most of those Textual
applications have been very quick demonstration or test applications built
to help support someone asking for help; some of them have been less-trivial
applications written in my own time and for my own use and amusement. Of
them I'd say there are two near-daily-drivers, and a couple that I either
have more plans for, or like to maintain just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Those latter applications are all ones that <a href="https://pypi.org/user/davepearson/">I've deployed to
PyPI</a>, and because of that are all ones
that I've recommenced be installed using
<a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/"><code>pipx</code></a>. During that time though I've had
half an inclination to make them <a href="https://brew.sh/">installable via
Homebrew</a>. While probably not installable from the core
Homebrew repository<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, at least installable from a "tap"<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> that's under
my own GitHub account or something.</p>
<p>To this end I've had <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew">a blog post about packaging Python apps for
Homebrew</a>
saved in Pinboard for a while now, and every time I look at it I think
<em>"this is a lot of faff, maybe later"</em>. Today was that "later".</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was <em>way</em> easier than I first realised. The evolution
of today pretty much went like this:</p>
<h2>Deciding to use a single repository as the "tap"</h2>
<p>The blog post above seemed to suggest that for every application repository
you want a tap for, you probably want a parallel <code>homebrew-</code>-prefixed
repository. This in turn would suggest that every time someone wants to
install one of your tools, they'd need to add a new tap<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. As I looked at
it this seemed like way too much faff, so in the end I decided <a href="https://github.com/davep/homebrew-homebrew">to create a
single repository that I'd keep all my formula files
in</a>. The naming of
<code>homebrew-homebrew</code> meant that the tap name would simply be
<code>davep/homebrew</code>.</p>
<p>Simple and clean, I think: things for homebrew, things that can be installed
via homebrew, that come from davep. To add the tap it's simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Ensuring that all my applications and libraries publish source</h2>
<p>Although it seems that it might be (possibly, maybe, perhaps, who can tell?)
deprecated, it looked like
<a href="https://github.com/tdsmith/homebrew-pypi-poet"><code>homebrew-pypi-poet</code></a> was a
tool I'd need to do all the heavy work on making the formula file. A quick
test threw up a problem where it was complaining that my test package (one
of my own applications) didn't have an <code>sdist</code>. Sure enough, through nothing
more than never having bothered to make it happen, the source of my
libraries and applications wasn't been uploaded to PyPI when I published.</p>
<p>So I went through some of my repositories and fixed that, making patch
releases as I went.</p>
<h2>Making a <code>Makefile</code> to let me be lazy</h2>
<p>The next thing to do was to figure out the most lazy way of building the
formula files. From what I could see the main steps to making all of this
work were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a venv and activate it</li>
<li>Install <code>homebrew-pypi-poet</code></li>
<li>Install the package you want to package for Homebrew</li>
<li>Run <code>poet</code> to make the formula</li>
</ul>
<p>Seemed simple enough. For all sorts of lazy reasons I still tend to use
<code>pipenv</code> to get things done quickly, and that seemed to work fine here too.
I'm also a fan of <code>PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=true</code> which makes things clean and
tidy, so I figured a rule in a <code>Makefile</code> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">clean</span><span class="o">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-rf<span class="w"> </span>.venv
<span class="w">        </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>Pipfile<span class="w"> </span>Pipfile.lock
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.12
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--dev<span class="w"> </span>homebrew-pypi-poet
</code></pre></div>

<p>would be fine to make a clean venv ready to build the formula, and then I'd
have a rule for the package itself that depended on the above, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">oshit</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">clean</span>
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oshit
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>poet<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>oshit<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>Formula/oshit.rb
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Fixing the package description</h2>
<p>The above was great, and worked really well. But there was one issue that I
could see: the resulting formula file always had this <code>desc</code> inside it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">desc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Shiny new formula&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>From what I could see there was no way to tell <code>poet</code> what I wanted the
description to be, and neither did I want to have to remember to edit that
line each time I regenerated the formula file. So <code>sed</code> to the rescue then I
guess, with this sort of thing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sed<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;s/Shiny new formula/The actual text I want/&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span>Formula/coolapp.rb
</code></pre></div>

<h2>The result</h2>
<p>The result of all of this is that I now have <a href="https://github.com/davep/homebrew-homebrew">a repository that I or anyone
else can use as a tap</a> to be
able to install my stuff using the <code>brew</code> command. So now if you want a
little Hacker News reader for the terminal but you don't want to be messing
with installing <code>pipx</code> and the like, but you do use <code>brew</code> on your machine,
it's just this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oshit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Fingers crossed it all "just works" when I next upgrade one of those
packages. I will, of course, have to remember to go into
<code>davep/homebrew-homebrew</code> and <code>make the-app</code> for the relevant application,
and then commit and push the changes, but that's really not too difficult to
remember and do.</p>
<p>Hopefully it'll then all just work.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>I just realised that it's been a while since I <a href="/2023/12/25/tinboard-0-4-0.html">last posted an
update</a> about <code>tinboard</code>. This is probably
my most-used Textual-based application, and one I'm constantly tinkering
with, and just this morning I published v0.10.0.</p>
<p>Often the changes are small tweaks or fixes to how it works, sometimes
they're simply updates to the version of Textual used, making use of some
new feature or other; I've yet to add another "major" feature so far. They
will come, but so far the ideas I have for the application haven't actually
felt that necessary. Although I say so myself it does what I need it to do
and it does it really well.</p>
<p>So, as a quick catch-up of what's changed since v0.4.0 (which was the last
version I posted about):</p>
<ul>
<li>v0.5.0 was released 2024-01-04; this included all the tags of a bookmark
when doing full-text searching.</li>
<li>v0.6.0 was released 2024-01-10; it fixed a small bug where the tag
suggestion facility got confused by trailing spaces in the input field.</li>
<li>v0.7.0 was released 2024-02-02; this updated the minimum Textual version to
v0.48.2 and removed all the custom changes to the Textual <code>TextArea</code> widget,
making use of the updates to <code>TextArea</code> that version of Textual made
available.</li>
<li>v0.8.0 was released 2024-02-18; this fixed a crash on startup caused by a
newer release of Textual (the fault was in <code>tinboard</code>; the update to Textual
helped reveal the problem).</li>
<li>v0.9.0 was released 2024-02-29; it simply added support for using
<kbd>Esc</kbd> at the top level of the application to quit (I like to camp
on <kbd>Esc</kbd> to GTFO).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just now, I released v0.10.0. This release makes full use of <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/4154">some
work I recently did to enhance Textual's <code>CommandPalette</code>
widget</a>, which added a
"discover" system. The change in <code>tinboard</code> is that all of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/tree/main/tinboard/commands">command
palette
providers</a>
now have <code>discover</code> methods too. The result of this change is that when you
open the command palette in <code>tinboard</code> (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) you
can see <em>every</em> possible command right away.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in discovery mode" src="/attachments/2024/03/07/command-palette.png#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on

      <div><p>I feel like I'm on a bit of a roll when it comes to building applications
for the terminal at the moment; while I'm still tinkering and improving
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">tinboard</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit">OSHit</a>, I had the urge to tackle another
idea that's been on my TODO list for a while.</p>
<p>This is something <a href="https://github.com/davep/quiz.el">I did for Emacs</a> back
in 2017 and I felt it was a <em>perfect</em> candidate for a Textual-based project.
It's a terminal-based trivia quiz game, using <a href="https://opentdb.com/">the Open Trivia
Database</a> as the source of questions.</p>
<p><img alt="Quizzical" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/quizzical.png#centre"></p>
<p>I've just published an early version <a href="https://pypi.org/project/quizzical/">to
PyPI</a>; it still needs some polish and I
have a few other ideas for it, but as it stands I feel it's a fun little
game to mess around with.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty straightforward: you can run it up and create lots of
different quizzes, there are various parameters you can use to create lots
of different kinds of challenges:</p>
<p><img alt="Building a new quiz" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/new-quiz.png#centre"></p>
<p>Once you're created a quiz, you can run it and answer away:</p>
<p><img alt="An example question" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/question.png"></p>
<p>Right now the idea is that you answer by pressing either <kbd>1</kbd>,
<kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>4</kbd> (or just <kbd>1</kbd> or
<kbd>2</kbd> for true/false questions); when I get a moment I'll also enable
mouse support for selecting an answer too (honestly I feel
keyboard-answering feels far more natural).</p>
<p>Once the quiz is done you can review your answers and see which were right
and which were wrong:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing results" src="/attachments/2024/01/29/results.png#centre"></p>
<p>As I say: there's a bunch of other things I want to add to this (keeping
track of scores, adding session token support to reduce the chances of
repeat questions, etc), but this felt like a good spot to make a v0.1.0
available if anyone else wanted to have a play.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/quizzical/">from PyPi</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/davep/quizzical">source is available over on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Now you can see why I made

      <div><p>Just a wee catch-up post about OSHit, <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit">my terminal-based HackerNews
browser</a>. Over the past couple of weeks I've
made some small changes, so I thought I'd make mention of what I've done.</p>
<p>As of v0.5.0, which I released earlier today, I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a quick way of following links while viewing a comment. While a
  comment is highlighted you can press <kbd>l</kbd> to follow a link; if
  there's more than one link in the comment a menu will be shown and you can
  select which one to follow.</li>
<li>Added support for viewing polls. Polls seem to be few and far between on
  HackerNews, so when I published the first version of OSHit I didn't have
  one to hand to test any code against. Eventually one turned up and broke
  OSHit (on purpose; I wanted to see when that happened) so I could then add
  the code to load polls and show them. Right now it just shows scores; I
  might do actual charts at some point.</li>
<li>Added optional item numbers in the lists; turned on/off with
  <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far all small things, but handy little improvements. There's still a nice
TODO list in the README and I will slowly work through it. Along with
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">tinboard</a> these are two applications
that have absolutely turned into "daily drivers", so they're going to get a
lot of tweaking over the next few weeks, probably even months.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Last week I was wrestling with some Textual code, trying to get something to
lay out on the screen "just so". On the whole this isn't too tricky at all,
and for those times where it might feel tricky <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/how-to/design-a-layout/">there's some advice
available on how to go about
it</a>. But in this case
I was trying to do a couple of "on the edge" things and one thing I really
needed to know was what particular part of the display was being "caused" by
what container or widget<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment anyway, Textual doesn't have a full-blown devtools with
all the bells and whistles; not like in your average web browser. It does
have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/">a devtools</a>, but not
with all the fancy DOM-diving stuff the above would have needed.</p>
<p>What I needed was the equivalent of <code>print</code>-debugging but with a
point-and-ask interface. Now, I actually <em>do</em> often do <code>print</code>-debugging
with Textual apps only I use
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.notify"><code>notify</code></a>;
this time though <code>notify</code> wasn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>I needed something that would let me point at a widget and say <em>"show me
stuff about this"</em>. Something that happens when the mouse hovers over a
widget. Something like... <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#tooltips">a
tooltip</a>!</p>
<p>So that was easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">widget</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span><span class="p">)]:</span>
        <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tooltip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="si">!r}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ancestors_with_self</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Suddenly I could hover my mouse over a bit of space on the screen and get a
"traceback" of sorts for what "caused" it.</p>
<p>I posted this little hack to <code>#show-and-tell</code> on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Discord
server</a> and someone mentioned it would be
handy if it also showed the CSS for the widget too. That was simple enough
because every widget has a <code>styles.css</code> property that is the CSS for the
widget, as a string.</p>
<p>After that I didn't think much more about it; until today.</p>
<p>Looking back, one thing I realised is that adding the CSS information
<code>on_mount</code> wasn't quite good enough, as it would only show me the state of
CSS when the mount happened, not at the moment I inspect the widget. I
needed the tooltip to be dynamic.</p>
<p>Thing is... Textual tooltips can't be functions (which would be the obvious
approach to make it dynamic); so there was no way to get this on-the-fly
behaviour I wanted.</p>
<p>Except there was! The type of
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/widget/#textual.widget.Widget.tooltip"><code>tooltip</code></a>
is <code>RenderableType</code>. So that means I could assign it an object that is a
Rich renderable; that in turn means I could write a <code>__rich__</code> method for a
class that wraps a widget and then reports back what it can see every time
it's called.</p>
<p>In other words, via one step of indirection, I could get the <em>"call a
function each time"</em> approach I was after!</p>
<p>It works a treat too.</p>
<p>All of which is a long-winded way of saying I now have a <code>print</code>-debug-level
DOM inspector tool for when I'm building applications with Textual:</p>
<p><img alt="textual-dominfo in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/15/textual-dominfo.png#centre"></p>
<p>If this sounds handy to you, you can grab the code too. Install it into your
development environment with <code>pip</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-dominfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then attach it to your app or screen or some top-level widget you're
interested in via <code>on_mount</code>; for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">textual_dominfo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">DOMInfo</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">DOMInfo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">attach_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then hover away with that mouse cursor and inspect all the things!
Whatever you do though, <em>don't</em> make it part of your runtime, and don't keep
it installed; just make it a development dependency.</p>

      <div><p>The idea for this one popped into my head while on the bus back from Textual
Towers this evening. So after dinner and some nonsense on TV I had to visit
my desk and do a quick hack.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown"><code>textual-countdown</code></a>, a
subtle but I think useful countdown widget for Textual applications.</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Countdown in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/11/textual-countdown.gif"></p>
<p>The idea is that you compose it somewhere into your screen, and when you
start the countdown the bar highlights and then starts to shrink down to
"nothing" in the middle of its display. When the countdown ends a message is
posted so you can then perform the task that was being waited for in an
event handler.</p>
<p>Not really a novel thing, I've seen this kind of thing before on the web;
I'm sure we all have. I just thought it would be a fun idea for Textual
applications too.</p>
<p>I envisage using this where, perhaps, an application needs to wait for an
API-visiting cooldown period, or perhaps as a subtle countdown for a
question in a quiz; something like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like it's something useful for your Textual
applications, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-countdown/">it's now available from
PyPi</a> and, of course, the
source is over <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown">on GitHub</a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This is actually the second release of OSHit since <a href="/2024/01/01/oshit.html">I first announced it a
week back</a>, and I'll get to that other release in a
moment.</p>
<p>I've just published v0.2.0, which isn't a very substantial release, but
which bumps the required version of Textual to
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.1">v0.47.1</a> and
has some fun with <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.0">the new nested CSS
feature</a>.</p>
<p>Underlying the point of this release was me taking a <em>"real world"</em>
application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in
part to get a feel for how and when it's useful, but also to give it a
proper test in a <em>"proper"</em> application. In doing so <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3969">I think I've found one
bug</a>.</p>
<p>Dogfooding is always a good idea.</p>
<p>The main visible change in this release is I've played around with the look
of the comments dialog a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="OSHit you have comments" src="/attachments/2024/01/07/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I'm still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I
started out with.</p>
<p>Another change I made was also to the comments dialog. Before, if you
performed the <em>"expand comments"</em> action on a comment card that already had
its comments expanded, it would move focus to the first child comment; this
was a deliberate choice that felt right at the time. Having used the app for
a few days now I've realised that making it an open/close toggle is far more
useful. So that's what I've done.</p>
<p>Now... as for <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/releases/tag/v0.1.1">the previous
release</a> I mentioned
above. That was a fun one.</p>
<p>Back when I released v0.1.0 some joker decided that it would be fun to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38831083">submit the blog post about it to the Orange
Site</a>. The comments there
went as you'd expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph, ignoring the tool itself.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in self-reflective way.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in a <em>"I never see the problem"</em>
  way.</li>
<li>One or two did the usual <em>"why even bother building that when
  <code>$TOOL_OF_CHOICE</code> exists?"</em> dance to show their terminal purity.</li>
<li>One or two posted genuinely useful links to other similar projects.</li>
<li>The biggest tree of comments was kind of a fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>One comment caught my eye though; someone reported having a problem running
it. My initial thought on reading it was <em>"my dude, seriously, you're going
to report the problem in some random comment on HN rather than raise an
issue with the author?!?"</em>.</p>
<p>For once <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues/2">I was wrong to be so cynical</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I'd been intentionally
reckless while writing the original code, and hadn't <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/pull/4">gone back to the API
code I'd written and made it behave</a>
before doing the initial release.</p>
<p>All of which is to say: if you run into a problem with some FOSS project, be
like <a href="https://github.com/mihaitodor">@mihaitodor</a>. Issue that thing so the
developer gets to know about it; don't assume they'll be reading some random
comment section, social media site or Discord server!</p>
<p>That and don't make 500+ HTTP requests at once; that might not end well for
some.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I know I'm not alone in having a relationship with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">the orange
site</a> that is... weird. I generally dislike
the culture there, it's almost impossible to read any of the comments
without being frustrated about the industry I work in or am adjacent to and
some of the people who inhabit it; but as a link aggregator of stuff I might
find interesting... I honestly can't think of anywhere better. So, yes, I've
been a fairly avid reader of HackerNews for many years, and have even had an
account there for over 4 years.</p>
<p>Given this, for a wee while now, I've been meaning to knock up a
terminal-based client for it using
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a>.</p>
<p>So after work on <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a> settled down I got
the urge to start a new pet project (not abandoning Tinboard, I'm still
going to be tweaking and extending it of course) and finally knocking up
that client seemed like the one.</p>
<p><em>Orange Site Hit</em> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="OShit" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index.png"></p>
<p>It's worth making clear from the very start: this is a read-only reader.
There is no logging in, there is no voting, there is no posting of things.
This is a client built with <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">their own
API</a> and it doesn't provide such a thing;
at least not now and despite me seeing past promises that this will change,
there's no API for doing that sort of thing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea of this application is you can run it up in the terminal, check the
top, best and latest from the categories provided by the API, perhaps dive
off into your web browser if needed, and then got on with other things.</p>
<p>It's there for when you're in the terminal you just <em>need</em> your hit of the
orange site.</p>
<p>The main screen of the app revolves around the index of items, most of which
are going to be stories. You can see an example of that above. For people
who prefer things to be slightly less cramped, I've also added a "relaxed
layout" mode too:</p>
<p><img alt="The index in relaxed mode" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index-relaxed.png"></p>
<p>From the index you can head off into your web-browser by hitting
<kbd>Enter</kbd> on any item; if the item is a story that links to somewhere
that link will be opened; if it's something more like <em>AskHN</em>, or a job,
it'll open the related page on HackerNews itself.</p>
<p>Pressing <kbd>u</kbd> with an item selected will let you view the details
for the user who posted the item:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the details of a user" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-user-dialog.png"></p>
<p>If you're the sort of person who wants to torture themselves by reading the
comments (oh come on we all do it!), there's a comment reader/navigator too.
With an item selected press <kbd>c</kbd> and the comment dialog will open:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the real meat of HackerNews" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the navigation within that dialog is fine; although I can see some
scope for improvement. At the moment it uses a widget-per-comment (actually,
it's at least 4 widgets per comment), which is fine and Textual handles that
without an issue, even on items with lots of comments, but longer-term I can
see me having some fun using <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#line-api">the line
API</a> to build a
super-efficient comment presentation and navigation widget.</p>
<p>That's it for now; it feels like a good v0.1.0 spot to be in. There are a
bunch of things I still want to do with it (better cleaning up of the text,
perhaps with some markup support so links get handled, etc; plus lots of
ways of searching for stuff), but I felt it was in a place where I could
start using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oshit/">from PyPi</a>. The
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit">source is available over on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <div><p>Although it's not planned this way, so far it looks like I'm on a "every
other day" release cycle with Tinboard right now! Today's release is a small
but handy one, I think.</p>
<p>Thanks to the handy little library
<a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip"><code>pyperclip</code></a> I've added:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to copy a bookmark's URL to the clipboard.</li>
<li>URL field autofill if you go to add a new bookmark and the clipboard
  appears to have a valid URL in it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The code for copying to the clipboard" src="/attachments/2023/12/25/copy-to-clipboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>At the moment the copy facility is just a straightforward copy of the URL,
nothing else. At some point I may add an extended copy option, which will
open a dialog with a bunch of options of what to copy from the bookmark, and
perhaps also how to format it or something. Like, often, if I'm copying a
bookmark's URL, it's because I want to paste it into some Markdown document,
or some location that will handle Markdown markup.</p>
<p>Perhaps that'll turn up in v0.5.0 in a couple of days? ;-)</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from

      <div><p>It looks like I'm in a wee period of small incremental changes and release
of <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a>. This morning I've release v0.3.0,
which has a couple of small but useful changes.</p>
<p>The first is more of a cosmetic thing. The <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/footer/"><code>Footer</code> widget in
Textual</a> is handy for showing
the current keyboard bindings in a given context, but it can get massively
cluttered very quickly (we do have plans to revisit this); in Tinboard this
clutter creep was turning into a thing.</p>
<p>So I've removed almost every binding from being displayed in the <code>Footer</code>,
and have placed an emphasis on the user pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> to get
context-sensitive help, and have also left the most useful bindings in the
footer with very minimal descriptions.</p>
<p>Given that this is a keyboard-first application, and I've tried to make the
bindings easy to remember, I think it's going to make more sense to do it
like this, and will make for a tidier UI too.</p>
<p>There is one disadvantage here of course: by removing the display of
bindings from the footer, the mouse-heavy user becomes disadvantaged; if a
particular binding doesn't have a UI feature that favours the mouse to cover
it too there's no way to initiate that action with the mouse. I'm going to
think on this a little. Again, Tinboard is designed for <em>me</em> first and
foremost, and my preference is to be keyboard-first when using the
application; but finding a good compromise would be advantageous when it
comes to advising people asking about Textual application design.</p>
<p>The second change is a simple but useful one. I've added a toggle of the
sort order of the tags menu in the left-hand column (bound to
<kbd>F4</kbd>). Right now it simply toggles between alphabetical order, or
bookmark count order (most to least). At some point I might make it more of
a cycle than a toggle, but this serves my purposes for now.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on
GitHub</a>.</p></div>
