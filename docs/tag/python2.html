  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier this week something in my development environment, relating to
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, Python,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> and
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">pipenv</a>, got updated and broke a handful
of repositories. Not in a way that I couldn't recover from, just in a way
that was annoying, got in the way of my workflow, and needed attention.
<em>(note to self: how I set up for Python/Django development on a machine
might be a good post in the future)</em></p>
<p>Once I was sure what the fix was (pretty much: nuke the virtual environment
and recreate it with <code>pipenv</code>, being very explicit about the version of
Python to use) the next step was to figure out how many repositories were
affected; not all were and there wasn't an obvious pattern to it. What was
obvious was that the problem came down to <code>python</code> in the <code>.venv</code> directory
pointing to a binary that didn't exist any more.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png" src="/attachments/2020/07/10/Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png"></p>
<p>So... tracking down problematic repositories would be simple enough, just
look for every instance of <code>.venv/bin/python</code> and be sure it points to
something rather than nothing; if it points to nothing I need to remake the
virtual environment.</p>
<p>I quickly knocked up a script that was based around looking over the results
of a <code>find</code>, and initially decided to use <code>file</code> to perform the test on
<code>python</code>. It seemed to make sense, as I wrote the script I checked the <code>man</code>
page for <code>file(1)</code> on macOS and sure enough, this exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-E On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that <code>file</code> dereferences links by default, that should get me an error
for a broken link, right? Bit hacky I guess, but it was the first thing that
came to mind for a quick bit of scripting and would do the trick. Only...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>-E<span class="w"> </span>does-not-exist

</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Wat</a>?!? But it's right there! It says so in the manual! <code>-E</code> is documented right in the manual page! And yet it's not in the valid switch list as put out by the command, <em>and</em> it's an <code>invalid option</code>. The hell?</p>
<p>So I go back and look at the <code>man</code> page again and then I notice it isn't in
the list of switches in the synopsis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br>
    file [-bcdDhiIkLnNprsvz] [--extension] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] [-P name=value] [-M magicfiles] file<br>
    file -C [-m magicfiles]<br>
    file [--help]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then did the obvious tests. Did I have <code>file</code> aliased in some way? No. Was
some other thing that works and acts like <code>file</code> in my path? No. Was I
absolutely 100% using <code>/usr/bin/file</code>? Yes.</p>
<p>Long story short: it seems the <code>man</code> page for <code>file</code>, on macOS, fibs about
what switches it supports; it says that <code>-E</code> is a valid option, but it's not
there.</p>
<p>What's even odder is the man page says it documents v5.04 of the command,
but <code>--version</code> reports v5.37. Meanwhile, if I check on a GNU/Linux box I
have access to, it does support <code>-E</code>, reports it in the switches, documents
it in the <code>man</code> page (in both the synopsis and in the main body of the page)
and it is v5.25 (and so is its man page).</p>
<p>So that was something like 20 minutes lost to a very small problem, for
which there was no real solution, but was time that had to be spent to get
to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>In the end I went with what I probably should have gone with in the first
place: <code>stat -L</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>venv<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-name<span class="w"> </span>.venv<span class="k">)</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">then</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="k">$(</span>dirname<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$venv</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now I have that script in my <code>~/bin</code> directory, ready for the next time
Homebrew and friends conspire to throw my day off for a while.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>At the start of this year, as part of a much bigger process to review the
work that had taken place over the previous 12 months, I was asked (at work)
to provide some information about how much time I'd spent on various
projects. Now, for me, there's really only one project, but there's lots of
different tools and libraries that I've written to support the main work I
do. All of these are split into different repositories in the
company-internal instance of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>. This meant
that getting a rough idea of what I was working on and when would be easy
enough -- it's all there in the commit history.</p>
<p>Given that this information would make up a couple of slides at most during
a far bigger presentation, I wanted something that would be snappy and easy
for non-developers to follow and understand. I spent a bit of time pondering
some options and decided that (ab)using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">gantt
chart</a> layout would make sense.</p>
<p>That choice was made all the more easier given that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#mermaid">GitLab
supports</a> the use of
<a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">mermaid charts</a> within its
Markdown. This meant I could quickly write some code that took the git log
of each repository, turned it into mermaid code, and then render it (by
hand, this was all about getting things done quickly) via GitLab.</p>
<p>This sounded like it could be a fun personal project. The result was some
Python code called <a href="https://github.com/davep/git2gantt">git2gantt</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the output isn't anything too clever, it's just code
that can be used to create a plot via mermaid. For example, running
git2gannt over itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>gantt
  title git2gantt output
  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

  section git2gantt
  Development: devgit2gantt20190208, 2019-02-08, 2019-02-13
  Development: devgit2gantt20190214, 2019-02-14, 2019-02-15
  Development: devgit2gantt20190303, 2019-03-03, 2019-03-04
  Development: devgit2gantt20191203, 2019-12-03, 2019-12-04
</code></pre></div>

<p>Usage is pretty straightforward: <img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at
13.18.12.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.18.12.png">
As you can see, it can be run over multiple repos at once, and there's also
an option to have it consider every branch within each repository. Another
handy option is the ability to limit the output to just one author --
perhaps you just want to document what you've done on a repo, not the
contributions of other people.</p>
<p>Also especially handy, if you don't want to bore people with too much
detail, is the "fuzz" option. This lets you tell <code>git2gannt</code> how relaxed you
want it to be when it tries to decide how long a run of work on a repo
lasted. So, perhaps, you're working on and off on a library that supports
some other system you're documenting, but you might only be making changes
every other day or so. With the correct fuzz value you can make it clear you
were working <em>on</em> the library for a couple of weeks, despite there only
being a commit every other day.</p>
<p>An example of running the output over a handful of projects would look
something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png"></p>
<p>This is one of those tools I knocked up quickly to get a job done, and
haven't quite got round to finishing off fully. One thing I'd really like to
do is add mermaid support directly within it, so that it actually has the
option to emit plots, not just mermaid code (or, perhaps, drop the mermaid
approach and use something else entirely).</p>
<p>Meanwhile though, if you're looking for something quick and dirty that will
help you visualise what you've been working on and when for a good period of
time... perhaps this will help.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's hardly a revelation to say that learning a new programming language, or
even learning software development at all, is even more difficult if you
don't have an actual problem to solve. I know I'm not alone in having pet
projects that, when faced with a new environment, I'll code up a version of
that project as a way to get familiar with and understand a language's
idioms while implementing something I know well.</p>
<p>Personally, my two favourites are a puzzle called 5x5
(<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.xml">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/Chrome-5x5">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-for-Chrome">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-Palm">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.el">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-react">here</a> and
<a href="http://davep.org/misc/5x5/">here</a>), and writing a library or even a full
application to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides">Norton Guide database
files</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg1013">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG">here</a>). Both are fun to work on, have
practical uses, and both have the benefit of being solved problems (for me)
that let me concentrate on the "how do I do <em>X</em> in this
language/toolkit/environment/framework/etc?".</p>
<p>Even with those two as my goto projects, I'm always open to new small
problems that might be fun to apply to languages I do know, or languages I
want to get to know (internally at work <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1123952281156751361">we have a fun "league" of sorts,
writing a particular hamming distance calculation tool in different
languages</a>, for
example).</p>
<p>A few days ago, via <a href="https://github.com/Lethrir/Journeys">this repo on
GitHub</a>, I discovered <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys">this fun little
problem</a>. Right away I could see the
benefit in it. As a "go away and code up a solution" interview question it
strikes me as near-perfect. It's obviously not hard to solve, but it touches
on some basic but important aspects of software development and so will
allow the developer to show off how they approach things.</p>
<p>There's so many different approaches to it too. Even in a single language, I
could imagine having some fun writing the smallest code to solve the
problem, the most idiomatic code to solve the problem, the most supportable
and well-documented code to solve the problem, etc. And then there's the
thing I talk about above: knowing the solution and knowing it's easy, you
can then use it to learn the idiomatic way of solving the problem in new
languages.</p>
<p>Even better, <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys#other-solutions">the README of the original repo links to solutions others have
written</a>. Knowing
the problem, and knowing the solution, you can then go and read other
people's code and learn something about different styles and different
languages.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, as I get free time, I think I might just do this.
Take the "Journeys" problem and write versions in different languages I work
with, or know, and also use it to get to know languages I've yet to know or
use heavily (I'm especially keen to try a version in
<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> -- a language I really like the look of and
want to find a reason to use).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, yesterday, I had a quick go at a first version in Python (aimed
at Python 3.8 or higher):
<a href="https://github.com/davep/journeys.py">https://github.com/davep/journeys.py</a></p>
<p>I set out to try and write something that was fairly idiomatic Python, which
uses tools that I tend to employ when working on Python projects (pipenv,
make, etc), and which also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">used something I've never quite found a need for
so far</a> in my usual
coding, but which I can see being useful and helpful.</p>
<p>I even threw in a couple of uses of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/">PEP
572</a>!</p>
<p>I can see me tinkering with this some more over the next few days. I can
even see me writing a very different implementation in Python, just for the
fun of it.</p>
<p>I think that's what I like about this little problem. It's a good way to do
a bit of programming exercise; it's like the perfect way to do the
programming equivalent of going for a short run.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I first got into Python in the mid-to-late 1990s. It's so far back that I
think the copy of <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/">Programming
Python</a> that I have (sadly in
storage at the moment) might be a first edition. I probably fell out of the
habit of using Python some time in the early 2000s (that was when I met
Ruby). It was only 22 months ago that I started using Python a <em>lot</em> thanks
to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">a change of
employer</a>.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, much had changed in the 15+ years since I'd last
written a line of Python in anger. So, early on, I made a point of making
<a href="https://www.pylint.org/">Pylint</a> part of my development process. All my
projects have a <code>make lint</code> make target. All of my projects lint the code
when I push to <code>master</code> in the company GitLab instance. These days I even
use <a href="https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a> to keep me honest as I
write my code; mostly gone are the days where I don't know of problems until
I do a <code>make lint</code>.</p>
<p>Leaning on Pylint in the early days of my new position made for a great
Python refresher for me. Now, I still lean on it to make sure I don't make
daft mistakes.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Pylint and I don't always agree. And that's fine. For example, I really
can't stand Pylint's approach to whitespace, and that is a hill I'll happily
die on. Ditto the obsession with lines being no more than 80 characters wide
(120 should be fine thanks). As such any project's <code>.pylintrc</code> has, as a
bare minimum, this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[FORMAT]</span>
<span class="na">max-line-length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">120</span>

<span class="k">[MESSAGES CONTROL]</span>
<span class="na">disable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">bad-whitespace</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Beyond that though, aside from one or two extras that pertain to particular
projects, I'm happy with what Pylint complains about.</p>
<p>There are exceptions though. There are times, simply due to the nature of
the code involved, that Pylint's insistence on code purity isn't going to
work. That's where I use its inline <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html#block-disables">block disabling
feature</a>.
It's handy and helps keep things clean (I won't deploy code that doesn't
pass 10/10), but there is always this nagging doubt: if I've disabled a
warning in the code, am I ever going to come back and revisit it?</p>
<p>To help me think about coming back to such disables now and again, I thought
it might be interesting to write a tool that'll show which warnings I
disable most. It resulted in <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/dd2721e0565928b4145698a42c9c74e4534c578a/conf.d/abbr.d/python.fish#L5">this fish
abbr</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr<span class="w"> </span>-g<span class="w"> </span>pylintshame<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;rg --no-messages \&quot;pylint:disable=\&quot; | awk &#39;BEGIN{FS=\&quot;disable=\&quot;;}{print \$2}&#39; | tr \&quot;,\&quot; \&quot;\n\&quot; | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea here being that it produces a "Pylint hall of shame", something
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">wildcard</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">import</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>To break the pipeline down:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rg --no-messages &quot;pylint:disable=&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>First off, I use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> (if you
don't, you might want to have a good look at it -- I find it amazingly
handy) to find everywhere in the code in and below the current directory
(the <code>--no-messages</code> switch just stops any file I/O errors that might result
from permission issues -- they're not interesting here) that contains a line
that has a Pylint block disable (if you tend to format yours differently,
you'll need to tweak the regular expression, of course).</p>
<p>I then pipe it through <code>awk</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">awk</span> <span class="s">&#39;BEGIN{FS=&quot;disable=&quot;;}{print $2}&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>so I can lazily <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/info/gawk/gawk.info.Field_Separators.html">extract everything after the
<code>disable=</code></a>.</p>
<p>Next up, because it's a possible list of things that can be disabled, I use
<code>tr</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>tr &quot;,&quot; &quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>to turn any comma-separated list into multiple lines.</p>
<p>Having got to this point, I <code>sort</code> the list, <code>uniq</code> the result, while
prepending a count (<code>-c</code>), and then <code>sort</code> the result again, in reverse and
sorting the numbers based on how a human would read the result (<code>-hr</code>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sort | uniq -c | sort -hr
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's short, sweet and hacky, but does the job quite nicely. From now on, any
time I get curious about which disables I'm leaning on too much, I can use
this to take stock.</p></div>

      Posted on 2019-10-26 13:19 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/python.html">Python</a>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Something I always try to do when I'm coding is be consistent. I feel this
is important. While people's coding standards may differ, I think different
approaches are easier to handle if someone has been consistent with their
style across all of their code.</p>
<p>This also stands for documentation too.</p>
<p>In my current position, I do a <em>lot</em> of Python coding, and one of the things
I like about Python (there are things I don't like too, but that's not for
now) is that it has doc-strings (just like my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">favourite
language</a>). I use them
extensively, ensuring every function and method has some form of
documentation, and generally I use
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> to generate documentation
from those doc-strings.</p>
<p>Early on I was bothered by the fact that, just by the simple act of making
typos, I wasn't keeping the form of the doc-strings consistent. And in this
case it was a <em>really</em> simple thing that was bugging me. Normally, if I'm
writing a single-line doc-string, I'll write like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">one_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is a one-line doc-string.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far, so good. But, if the doc-string is a multi-liner, I prefer the
ending quotes to be on a line of their own, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But, sometimes, by accident, I'd leave a doc-string like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While it's really not a big deal, it would bug me and every time I found one
like this I'd "fix" it.</p>
<p>Eventually, it bugged me enough that I decided I was going to write a little
tool to find all such instances in my code and report them. My first
approach was to think "I could just do this with some regexp magic", <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">which
was really a bad idea</a>. Then I
though, I know, I should use this as an excuse to to play with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">Python's ast
library</a>.</p>
<p>That worked really well! I had <a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck/blob/dc5052002690b1f898ccd68f815cdedbe9172b74/pydscheck">the first version of the
code</a>
up and running in no time. It was simple but did the job. It ran through
Python code I threw at it and alerted me to both missing doc-strings, and
doc-strings with the ending I didn't like.</p>
<p>That served me for a while, until one day I realised that it wasn't quite
doing the job correctly; it was only really looking at top-level functions
and top-level methods in classes. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, I'll
define functions within functions, and I feel they deserve documentation
too. So then I modified the code to ensure it walked every part of the AST.</p>
<p>Since then, when I've run into new things and had new ideas, <code>pydscheck</code> has
grown and grown. I've added checks that all mentioned parameters have a
type; I've added checks that any function/method that returns something
actually documents the return value; I've added checks that any
documentation of a returned value includes its type; I've added checks that
any function or method that yields a value documents that fact; I've added
checks that ensure that every parameter is documented in some way.</p>
<p>Each time I've done this it's helped uncover issues in my code's
documentation that could be cleaner, and it's also given me a pet project to
slowly better understand Python's AST.</p>
<p>It could be that there are better tools out there, I'd have thought that a
good doc-string linting tool would be something someone had already written.
But this time around I was happy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> it because I needed a
fun learning exercise that would also have some benefits for my day-to-day
work.</p>
<p>I'll caveat this with the fact that it's very particular to how I work and
how I like my documentation to look, but if it sounds useful, here it is:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck">https://github.com/davep/pydscheck</a>.</p>
<p>There's still lots I could do with it. First off I should really properly
package it up so it can be installed as a command line tool via pip. Other
things that would be handy would be to allow some form of customisation of
how it works. I'm sure there's other fun things I can do with it too.</p>
<p>That's part of the fun of having a pet project: you can tinker when you like
and also get benefits from it as you use it.</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>One of the things I really like about coding with Emacs is how I can easily
identify a repeated task and turn it into a command in my environment,
saving me a load of work down the line.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el"><code>pypath.el</code></a> is one such example.</p>
<p>In my day job I write a lot of Django code. As part of that, I write a good
number of unit tests too. Sometimes I'll write the tests as I'm writing the
code they test, other times I'm writing them afterwards; it all really
depends on where my head's at and how the code is flowing.</p>
<p>When I'm writing those tests, I often want to test them as I go. Given that
starting up a test session can take a while, and given that running all the
tests in the system can take a while, it's really handy if I can run that
single test I'm working on.</p>
<p>This is easy enough with Django. In my work environment it's normally
something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>./manage.py<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">test</span><span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span>app.test.some.sub.module.TestClass.test_method
</code></pre></div>

<p>Only... typing out the:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">some</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test_method</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>part is a bit of a pain. Sure, once you've typed it the once you can use
your shell of choice (mine being <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> and on
occasion
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">eshell</a>)
to recall it from history, but typing it out the first time is the annoying
part.</p>
<p>So this was the point where I took 1/2 hour or so to code up
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el"><code>pypath.el</code></a> to solve the problem for
me. It gives me two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pypath</code>: which simply places the dotted path of the <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/python-info-current-defun.html">current
  "defun"</a>,
  within the context of being part of a Django system, into the clipboard
  buffer.</li>
<li><code>pypath-django-test</code>: which works similar to the above but places the
  whole Django testing command into the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above, I can work on a test, hit the latter command above, flip to
my command line, paste and I'm running the test.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm sure there's plenty of other handy ways to do this. Doubtless
there's work environments where the test can be run right there, in the edit
buffer, without flipping away, and which takes into account the fact that
there's a pipenv-managed virtual environment involved, etc. If there is,
that's great, but I don't think it'd work with how I work.</p>
<p>And that's one of the things I really love about Emacs, and why it's still
my work environment after almost 25 years of on and off use: with very
little work on my part I can create a couple of commands that work exactly
how I need them to. While it's great to create <a href="https://melpa.org/">generally-useful code for
Emacs that lots of people benefit from</a>, sometimes the
real value is that <a href="https://blog.davep.org/delpa/">you can code up your own particular quirk and just get
on with stuff</a>.</p>
<p>To conclude: this post isn't to show off <code>pypath.el</code>; really this post is to
sing the praises of Emacs and why it still works so well for me after all
these years.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's been very quiet on the blogging front, I'm afraid, mostly for <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">the
reasons I wrote about back in December last
year</a>. In that time I've been really
very busy with work (in a good way, in a <em>very</em> good way) and there's not a
whole lot of time to be toying with pet projects at home.</p>
<p>However, finding myself with a spare hour or so, I wanted to write about
something I did run into as part of some development at work, and which I
thought might be worth writing about in case it helps someone else.</p>
<p>Recently I've needed to write a library of code for loading data from Excel
Workbooks. Given that the vast majority of coding I do at the moment is in
Python, it made sense to make use of
<a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/">openpyxl</a>. The initial prototype code I
wrote worked well and it soon grew into a full-blown library that'll be used
in a couple of work-related projects.</p>
<p>But one thing kept niggling me... It just wasn't as fast as I'd expected.
The workbooks I'm pulling data from aren't that large, and yet it was taking
a noticeable number of seconds to read in the data, and when I let the code
have a go at a directory full of such workbooks... even the fan on the
machine would ramp up.</p>
<p>It didn't seem right.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of profiling and could see that the code was spending
most of its time deep in the guts of some XML-parsing functions. While I
know that an <code>xlsx</code> file is pretty much an XML document, it seemed odd to me
that it would take so much time and effort to pull the data out from it.</p>
<p>Given that I had other code to be writing, and given that the
workbook-parsing code was "good enough" for the moment, I moved on for a
short while.</p>
<p>But, a couple of weeks back, I had a bit of spare time and decided to
revisit it. I did some more searching on openpyxl and speed issues and
almost everything I found said that the common problem was failing to open
the workbook in <code>read_only</code> mode. That can't have been my problem because
I'd being doing that from the very start.</p>
<p>Eventually I came across a post somewhere (sorry, I've lost it for now --
I'll try and track it down again) that suggested that openpyxl was very slow
to read from a workbook if you were reading one cell at a time, rather than
using generators. The suggestion being that every time you pull a value form
a cell, it has to parse the whole sheet up to that cell. Generators, on the
other hand, would allow access to all the cells during one parse.</p>
<p>This seemed a little unlikely to me -- I'd have expected the code to cache
the parsing results or something like that -- but it also would explain what
I was seeing. So I decided to give it a test.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/openpyxl-speed-issue"><code>openpyxl-speed-issue</code></a> is a
version of the tests I wrote and ran and they absolutely show that there's a
huge difference between cell-by-cell access vs generator access.</p>
<p>Code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_row</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_column</span> <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="p">][</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is <em>far slower</em> than something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">wb</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test Sheet&quot;</span> <span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">cell</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here's an example of the difference in time, as seen on my iMac:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>make<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">test</span>
pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="w"> </span>./read-using-generators
<span class="w">        </span><span class="m">1</span>.59<span class="w"> </span>real<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.44<span class="w"> </span>user<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.04<span class="w"> </span>sys
pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="w"> </span>./read-using-peeking
<span class="w">       </span><span class="m">25</span>.02<span class="w"> </span>real<span class="w">        </span><span class="m">24</span>.88<span class="w"> </span>user<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.10<span class="w"> </span>sys
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the cell-by-cell approach is about 16 times slower than the
generator approach.</p>
<p>In most circumstances the generator approach would make most sense anyway,
and in any other situation I probably would have used it and never have
noticed this. However, the nature of the workbooks I need to pull data from
means I need to "peek ahead" to make decisions about what I'm doing, so a
more traditional loop over, with an index, made more sense.</p>
<p>I can easily "fix" this by using the generator approach to build up a
two-dimensional array of cells, acquired via the generator; so I can still
do what I want <em>and</em> benefit from using generators.</p>
<p>In conclusion: given that I found it difficult to find information about my
speed issue, and given that the one off-hand comment I saw that suggested it
was this wasn't exactly easy to find, I thought I'd write it all down too
and <a href="https://github.com/davep/openpyxl-speed-issue">create a repository of some test code to illustrate the
issue</a>. Hopefully someone
else will benefit from this in the future.</p></div>
