<p>The run of writing new terminal-based tools that I want still keeps going.
First there was <a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">Braindrop</a>, then there was
<a href="/2025/01/25/peplum.html">Peplum</a>, and now, released today, there's
<a href="https://github.com/davep/hike">Hike</a>.</p>
<p>Hike is yet another terminal-based Markdown browser. While it's far from the
first, and unlikely to be the last, it's mine and it looks and works exactly
how I need. Perhaps it'll be your sort of thing too?</p>
<p><img alt="Hike viewing its README" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-in-action.png"></p>
<p>This initial release has a bunch of handy features, including things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A command line where file names, URLs and commands can be entered.</li>
<li>A persistent history for the command line.</li>
<li>A local file browser.</li>
<li>A simple bookmarking system.</li>
<li>A browsing history.</li>
<li>Commands for quickly loading and viewing files held on GitHub, GitLab,
  Codeberg and Bitbucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>As there's a lot to discover in the application, I've tried to make the help
screen as comprehensive as possible:</p>
<p><img alt="Hike help" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-help.png"></p>
<p>and there's also the command palette to help with discovering commands and
the keys that are associated with them:</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in action" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>Once again, themes are supported so no matter your taste you should find
something that's easy on your eyes:</p>
<p><img alt="Dark" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-textual-dark.png">
<img alt="Light" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-textual-light.png">

<img alt="Solarized Light" src="/attachments/2025/02/14/hike-solarized-light.png"></p>
<p>Hike is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/hike">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hike/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>hike
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>hike</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>hike
</code></pre></div>

<p>Expect to see more updates in the near future; this is very much an ongoing
tinker project.</p></div>

      <div><p><img alt="Peplum" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-social-banner.png"></p>
<p>I seem to be back in the swing of writing handy (for me) little
terminal-based applications again. Having not long since <a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">released
Braindrop</a> (which I'm still working on and
tinkering with; it'll get more features in the near future, for sure), I had
an idea for another tool I'd like to have: something for looking through,
searching, and filtering <a href="https://peps.python.org">Python PEPs</a>.</p>
<p>As with anyone who is interested in what's happening with Python itself, I
subscribe to the RSS feed of the latest Python PEPs, but I also wanted
something that would let me look back at older ones in a way that worked
<em>"just so"</em> (<em>"just so" being "what feels right for me"</em>, of course). Having
finished the main work on Braindrop I realised that the general layout of
its UI would work here, as would the filtering and searching approach I
used.</p>
<p>From this idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/peplum">Peplum</a> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Peplum in action" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum.png"></p>
<p>In this first release I've simply concentrated on all things to do with
grabbing the list of PEPs and presenting them in a useful way; adding
various forms of filtering them; adding the ability to search the metadata;
that sort of thing. I aim to keep developing this out over the next few
weeks and months, adding things like the ability to make notes, to locally
view the text of a PEP, perhaps even to mark PEPs as unread and read, etc.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, much of the design was driven by what I did with
Braindrop, so once again I've tried my very best to make it
keyboard-friendly and as much as possible keyboard-first. This sometimes
means having to work against how Textual works, but generally that isn't too
tricky to do. I'm once again making heavy use of the command palette and
also ensuring that all commands that have corresponding keyboard bindings
are documented in the help screen.</p>
<p><img alt="Peplum Help" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-help.png"></p>
<p>There's enough common code between Peplum and Braindrop, when it comes to
this aspect of building a Textual application, that I'm minded to spin it
out into a little library of its own. I'm going to sit on this code for a
wee while and see how it develops, but I can see me taking this approach
with future applications and doing this will stop the need to copy and
paste.</p>
<p>It might also be useful to others building with Textual.</p>
<p>Also as with Braindrop, themes are a thing, and the theme setting is sticky
so you can set it the once and stick with that you like. Here's some
examples:</p>
<p><img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-nord.png">
<img alt="Catppuccin Latte" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-catppuccin-latte.png">
<img alt="Tokyo Night" src="/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-tokyo-night.png"></p>
<p>That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.</p>
<p>While working on this project I managed to find a couple more bugs in
Textual, including <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5488">a fun way to get <code>transparent</code> backgrounds to get out of
sync</a> and also a way to
get <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5489">an easy crash out of <code>OptionList</code> if it's set to <code>width:
auto</code></a>.</p>
<p>What was even more fun was I sort of <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/113843011699020404">discovered a bug in the Python PEP
API</a>. Thanks to
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@hugovk@mastodon.social">Hugo</a> noticing my <em>"huh,
weird"</em> post on Fosstodon, there's <a href="https://github.com/python/peps/issues/4211">now an issue for
it</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/python/peps/pull/4226">a PR in the
works</a>. In retrospect I should
have raised an issue myself; instead I fell into that <em>"they obviously know
what they're doing so it must be like this for a reason"</em> trap.</p>
<p>Lesson relearned: it's always better to ask and get an answer, than to
assume a thing is how it is for a reason you don't know; which I guess is a
version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus' law</a> really.</p>
<p>So that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out and
there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/peplum">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/peplum/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>peplum
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>peplum</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>peplum
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm going to be making good use of this and working on it more; I hope it's
useful to someone else. :-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><img alt="Braindrop" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-social-banner.png"></p>
<p>A touch over a year ago I did the initial work on an application called
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a>, a terminal-based client for
the Pinboard bookmarking service. I had a lot of fun building it and it was
an application that I used on a near-daily basis. However, around August
last year <a href="/2024/08/18/paindrop.html">I realised it was time for me to move on from Pinboard and try
something new</a>; based on various recommendations
I settled on <a href="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="(/2024/08/18/paindrop.html)">in the other blog post</a>, Raindrop
offered more or less everything I had with Pinboard and so the move was
fairly straightforward. The one thing that was missing though was an
application similar to Tinboard.</p>
<p>So, late on last year, with my winter break approaching, I decided to start
from scratch and build a <em>"Tinboard for Raindrop"</em>, which I'm calling
<a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop">Braindrop</a>.</p>
<p>This was going to be a bit of an adventure too. Since <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">being laid off from
Textualize earlier in 2024</a> I'd not
been following its development quite as closely as I used to, and had also
run into some issues and bugs with it since that time; moreover, as well as
various bugs appearing, some breaking changes had also been made. As such
this was going to be a process where I'd wrap my head around what's happened
with the framework over the prior six months or so.</p>
<p>Given all this, over the past couple of weeks I've been spending a few hours
a day doing some for-pleasure coding and v0.1.0 of Braindrop is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Main display" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-main.png"></p>
<p>As much as possible I've tried to keep the look and feel similar to that of
Tinboard, while also doing my best to avoid some of the <em>"ah, I wish I
hadn't done it this way"</em> design decisions I'd made. As of the time of
writing I'm very pleased with the result.</p>
<p><img alt="The edit dialog" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-edit.png"></p>
<p>One thing I did want to do is ensure that the application was as
keyboard-friendly as possible, while also still allowing use of the mouse.
Textual can sometimes get that wrong and I ran into an example of this while
trying to ensure that there's good in-application help. Somewhat recently
Textual added a built-in help system which, sadly, can't easily be used by
and navigated by someone using the keyboard. So instead I've recreated the
help system I built into Tinboard, while adopting the documentation standard
that Textual had settled on (which, coincidentally, was kind of similar to
what I did in Tinboard to start with).</p>
<p><img alt="The help dialog" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-help.png"></p>
<p>As with Tinboard, I've also made sure to make full use of the command
palette, with every action that makes sense having a keyboard hotkey as well
as a command in the palette. I also took things a little further and made
sure that the hotkeys are shown in the command palette for easier discovery.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>I've also made sure that Textual's new theme system is available for easy
use; so out goes dark/light mode toggling and in comes a collection of
different themes. Here's a wee selection as an example:</p>
<p><img alt="Example theme 1" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-1.png">
<img alt="Example theme 2" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-2.png">
<img alt="Example theme 3" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-3.png">
<img alt="Example theme 4" src="/attachments/2025/01/03/braindrop-theme-4.png"></p>
<p>That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.</p>
<p>There's a few more things I want to do before I consider the application
v1.0-ready, but it's already in use by me and working well. As I decide what
else I want to add to it <a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATODO">I'm building up a list of TODO
items</a>.</p>
<p>Given that my day job these days is quite varied, isn't quite so
coding-intensive, and isn't always related to all things Python, it's
actually been fun to sit down and hack up a pure Python application from
scratch again. It's also helped me discover a couple or so fresh bugs in
Textual (which <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/created_by/davep">I've
reported</a>, of
course) and given me the opportunity to <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pulls/davep">PR some trivial fixes as I've
noticed typos and stuff as I
go</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/braindrop">via

  <div>
      <div><p>Recently I've been on a bit of a <em>"turn stuff into Markdown files and slap
them in an Obsidian Vault"</em> trip. This kicked off a couple of months back
when I made a decision unrelated to coding.</p>
<p>On and off, since my teenage years, I've kept journals. Since those teenage
years it's been more off than on, but a couple of times in my adult life
it's been really helpful to actually write one. The last time this happened
was early 2019. It was pretty vital I did that at the time and it was a
really sensible and helpful decision, and an approach to the situation I was
in that I'd recommend to anyone (and have done on occasion to anyone going
through the same thing).</p>
<p>The actual motivation for starting that particular journal is long behind
me, but I'd got into the habit of writing it and so, until a couple or so
months back, I kept jotting something down every day. But I came to the
realisation that I didn't <em>need</em> to and that it had become something of a
chore.</p>
<p>I'd been using an application called <a href="https://journey.cloud">Journey</a>. It's
a great app, does the job well, but was also suffering from the creep of
"AI" (I've had a few apps ion my arsenal that don't need it, acquire a
useless "AI" feature). This privacy-problematic change of direction,
combined with the realisation that I didn't <em>need</em> to write about my day,
every day, any more, made me decide it was time to stop and cancel the
subscription.</p>
<p>Thankfully Journey has a pretty comprehensive export option so I used it and
didn't think too much more about it for a while.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I also had a subscription to <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> that
I didn't really use any more. Within it I had held a handful of years of
journal entries from a decade or so ago, along with other <em>"remember this
for some point in the future"</em> stuff. For the longest time I was on some
really cheap tier that didn't exist any more, one that was low enough that I
didn't really notice the cost go out each month so I kept putting off
exporting things and closing it all down until <em>"next month"</em>.</p>
<p>Then I got an email from them to say they were forcing me onto some new tier
that was more expensive. So that was the final straw there. I made an export
of what I had in Evernote and closed that account down too.</p>
<p>A wee while went past and then I got to thinking that it might be
interesting to try and combine both these sources into one archived journal.
I had stuff from around 2010 to 2015, and I also had stuff from 2019 until
2024; the former in the Evernote archive and the latter in the Journey
archive. Surely I could write a couple of tools to turn that data into one
consolidated Obsidian Vault?</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of weekends
<a href="https://github.com/davep/journey2md"><code>journey2md</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/evernote2md"><code>evernote2md</code></a> were born. While both
of those tools work differently, they're both designed to populate the same
Obsidian Vault. Once I was happy with this I did the mass conversion and I
was happy with the result.</p>
<p>Now I have years of journal entries, all converted to Markdown files and
made available for reading via an application that lets me rummage through
history using dates and tags and all sorts of other searching.</p>
<p>So I was happy with that and didn't give it much more though.</p>
<p>Then last week I got to thinking...</p>
<p>Twitter has turned into the worst place possible and I can't for the life of
me think why any right-thinking person who has an ounce of humanity or has
anything approaching a humanistic outlook on life would remain an active
user. Honestly I stuck it out longer than was sensible, but in June 2023 I
finally quit for good.</p>
<p>Back when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">new owner was
confirmed</a>
I, like a lot of people, extracted my archive. It's since been sat in
storage doing nothing, yet there's a lot of data in there that could be
interesting to work with, or just to go back and look through. So last
week's thought was <em>"why don't I also turn this into an Obsidian Vault?"</em>.</p>
<p>So I did...</p>
<p><img alt="The graph of my Twitter Obsidian Vault" src="/attachments/2024/11/04/bird2glass.png"></p>
<p>The tool I built to do this is
<a href="https://github.com/davep/bird2glass"><code>bird2glass</code></a>. As you'll see in <a href="https://github.com/davep/bird2glass/blob/main/README.md">the
README</a> it makes a
few assumptions about the state of Twitter archive dumps and also what a
user wants from this. Personally I'm pleased with the result.</p>
<p>The main aim of the tool is to break the tweets down into a hierarchy of
year, month and day...</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing a tweet" src="/attachments/2024/11/04/tweet-view.png"></p>
<p>...and also to connect them with any account that was being replied to or
mentioned in some way...</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing a user" src="/attachments/2024/11/04/user-view.png"></p>
<p>This user view is handy when viewing backlinks, as it gives you a list of
all the tweets that mention that user (and, of course, if you're into
Obsidian's graph it will make for some interesting connections within
there).</p>
<p>I sense there's more I can do with this, and I imagine I will continue to
tinker with it. Meanwhile though, if that sounds like something you'd
benefit from do feel free to grab it and play with it and hack on it. Keep
in mind the notes and assumptions that are in the README, and <em>really</em> be
prepared for a lot of files to be created if you did a lot of tweeting like
I did (I do think that over 50,000 individual files for an Obsidian Vault is
a bit silly, if I'm honest).</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I might need to look at other applications and think about how
I can turn the data into useful Markdown collections!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I was quite late discovering Pinboard; by the looks of things I created my
account and paid my first subscription for it in early 2019. Since then I've
been a pretty avid user and found it really useful. I've even written a
couple of clients for it (<a href="https://github.com/davep/pinboard.el">one for
Emacs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">one for the
terminal</a>).</p>
<p>During that time it's had its fair share of hiccups and outages, but on the
whole I've found it a stable and useful service.</p>
<p>The service does have its detractors, and concerns over its long-term
stability and how well it's maintained <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34062802">are fairly
common</a>. I half paid
attention to these, and had started to think about where I might go if there
was an issue.</p>
<p>While maintaining and syncing bookmarks isn't exactly a difficult or
unsolved problem, and while it's also true that it could be fun to roll my
own solution, there are a couple of things I need that would make building
my own approach a bit of a chore.</p>
<p>Things important to me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extension for any random browser I might find myself using</li>
<li>A good mobile client for at least iOS and iPadOS</li>
<li>A good API so I can write my own tools if I need to</li>
<li>A clean and focused backend website</li>
</ul>
<p>I kept these things in mind and kept an eye out but I'd never really felt
the need to actively start looking around.</p>
<p>Then I <a href="https://sfba.social/@peterme/112915495895055170">stumbled on this</a>
after posting about <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/112925762265869565">another Pinboard
outage</a>.</p>
<p>That... yeah, that was the final push I needed to start to think seriously
about where to move and how.</p>
<p>A couple of people suggested <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop</a>, and from what
I could tell it was coming up as a pretty popular service that some Pinboard
users were migrating to. I had a look and it wasn't <em>quite</em> what I was
after; but close.</p>
<p>You see, there's two things I really like about Pinboard that Raindop didn't
seem to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple support for "this shit is unread". I see things, I share to
  whatever Pinboard app I have on my phone or tablet, etc, and then I review
  some time later (normally in
  <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a>).</li>
<li>Support for Private and Public pins. I've liked <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep">having a feed of
  bookmarks I can let people see</a> and Raindrop
  doesn't have this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked around at some blogs that talked about Pinboard vs Raindrop and
didn't see any that really dived into this particular aspect of migrating; I
also asked a couple of folk who'd made the move about this and they didn't
really have any insight (mainly because they didn't care about those
particular uses).</p>
<p>One thing I did notice though was that Raindrop <em>does</em> support making
individual collections public. So, if I was willing to sacrifice any other
uses for collections (a bookmark in Raindrop can only be in one collection),
I could simply have a <em>Public</em> and a <em>Private</em> collection and import pins
into the appropriate one. Also, unread pins could be left out of the
collections and I could use that to signify unread status.</p>
<p>This seemed fine as I'm heavy on the tags anyway.</p>
<p>Now... Raindrop has a pretty comprehensive import facility built in. I gave
it a try with Pinboard's backup file and it worked really well. That is...
really well except it just threw away the public/private/unread aspect of
the pins. There was only one thing for it then: I had to write my own
importer!</p>
<p>Which brings me to <a href="https://github.com/davep/paindrop"><code>Paindrop</code></a>. It's a
quick hack but it does the job, and it does the import just how I wanted.
The result of the first test was pretty much spot on (in this image I'm
comparing what Raindrop says vs what Tinboard says I have in Pinboard):</p>
<p><img alt="Comparing Raindrop and Tinboard contents" src="/attachments/2024/08/18/raindrop-imports.png#centre"></p>
<p>Usage is pretty straightforward. You create <code>Public</code> and <code>Private</code>
collections in Raindrop, you create an app in Raindrop and get the access
token, you grab your Pinboard access token and then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>paindrop<span class="w"> </span>example:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<span class="w"> </span>xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
</code></pre></div>

<p>where the first parameter is the Pinboard access token and the second the
Raindrop access token.</p>
<p>If all goes well, after a few moments, the importer should finish and you
should find that all of your pins have migrated to Raindrop, all public pins
are in the <code>Public</code> collection and all private pins are in the <code>Private</code>
collection. Any pins that were marked as unread will be <em>Unsorted</em>.</p>
<p>Note that if you used different names for your public and private
collections you can pass those names to <code>paindrop</code> with the <code>--public</code> and
<code>--private</code> switches.</p>
<p>If you're looking to move your bookmarking history out of Pinboard and want
to keep the same sort of structure I had I hope Paindrop will be useful to
you too.</p>
<p>Paindrop can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/paindrop/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>paindrop</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>paindrop
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/davep/paindrop">source is available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>PS: As for the name... originally it was <code>pin2rain</code> but then <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@darrenburns/112978377299333401">Darren Burns
pointed out the obvious and it had to
happen</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a> v0.14.0.
This release adds a <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/issues/49">feature that a user
requested</a>, where you can set
the default values for the privacy and read-later status of a new bookmark:</p>
<p><img alt="The application settings dialog" src="/attachments/2024/05/15/app-settings.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, any time you create a new bookmark, the edit dialog will use those
values by default. It's a feature that makes perfect sense but I didn't
think to add it early on because... well, I set the defaults to my
preference.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a> has turned into a tool I use
pretty much every day; it's probably my most-used Textual/Python-developed
application at this point. This is causing me to think more and more about
how I can add things to it that are related to the core purpose, but are
also outside of the main "interface with Pinboard" thing.</p>
<p>A thing with keeping bookmarks for a long time is that some of them go
stale, go away. Some will just plain 404, others the whole site will
disappear. If I find myself going back to a bookmark and seeing this is the
case, I'll hit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and see if
there's an archive there.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking: what if I add the ability to perform this check into
Tinboard itself? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDgiM6pUP2Y">So I did just that</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in the application, if you press <kbd>w</kbd> with a bookmark
highlighted, it will check with the Wayback Machine to see if the bookmark
is in the archive. If it isn't you see this:</p>
<p><img alt="No archive result" src="/attachments/2024/04/18/no-archive.png#centre"></p>
<p>On the other hand, if it <em>is</em> in the archive, you'll see something like
this:</p>
<p><img alt="Is in the archive result" src="/attachments/2024/04/18/has-archive.png#centre"></p>
<p>I sense this is going to be the first step in a couple of features related
to this. I'm thinking that I may go on to add a <em>"swap the URL for this
bookmark with the Wayback Machine archive URL"</em> feature, which will be handy
for those bookmarks that have one away, and it would also be useful to look
at the options for a <em>"please archive a copy of this bookmark"</em> feature.</p>
<p>But, for now, v0.12.0 is available and has this handy (for me anyway) first
step.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>

      <div><p>Back in the very early days of the <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">Textual
adventure</a>,
within the first month or so of working on the framework, we <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">had a period
of
dogfooding</a>.
One of the projects I wrote during that time was a little tool <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/12/08/be-the-keymaster/#pispy">I called
PISpy</a>.</p>
<p>The initial version was pretty much a quick hack; during that dogfooding
period I did my best to try and develop a new project every couple of days.
Since then I've let PISpy descend into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">bit
rot</a>.</p>
<p>In the last week or so I've turned my attention back to it and made an
effort to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CepsN8TDq1E">tidy up the code</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EUXA8RkN0">tidy it some more</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u5CfrgZWcc">and some
more</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDCvWCZx1AM">even some
more</a>.</p>
<p>This morning I put the finishing touches to these changes and released
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pispy/releases/tag/v0.6.0">v0.6.0</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/67xtMdstbx4"><img alt="PISpy in action" src="/attachments/2024/04/17/pispy-in-action.gif#centre"></a></p>
<p>PISpy can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideallty) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">from

<p>In doing so I extended the application so that it's possible to run
<code>tinboard add</code> and quickly enter a new bookmark and then carry on in the
terminal, without needing to "go fullscreen". I'll admit it's of limited
use, but it seemed like a good shakedown of the feature and in working on it
I was able to discover a couple of bugs
(<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4385">#4385</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4403">#4403</a>).</p>
<p>The effect of this is this:</p>
<p><img alt="Tinboard inline addition in action" src="/attachments/2024/04/09/tinboard-inline-add.gif#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>tinboard
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on GitHub</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>While I have been <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">on the receiving end of redundancy once
before</a>, that was after 21 years of
service at a company that, while it was in part about software development,
I would never have called it a "tech" company.</p>
<p>So, as of today, I can finally say that the "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/tech-layoffs-2023-list/">tech
layoffs</a>" came
for me and I'm one of 67% of employees being let go from a tech startup.</p>
<p>Achievement unlocked, I guess?</p>
<p><img alt="!Achievement unlocked" src="/attachments/2024/03/28/achievement-unlocked.png#centre"></p>
<p>To be clear: I'm not annoyed about this, I'm not even shocked about this; I
planned for this from the off and realised and recognised the gamble I was
taking <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1574118265063972864">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1574118265063972864"><img alt="Announcing being hired" src="/attachments/2024/03/28/textual-startup-tweet.png#centre"></a></p>
<p>I am disappointed about this. Not in a "I'm disappointed in you" kind of
way, but disappointed for all involved and what it says about how FOSS
projects are funded and maintained.</p>
<p>It's been an interesting journey, and it's been a privilege to do something
I've been wanting to do since the 1990s, when I first read the GNU Manifesto
and subsequently watched the free software and open source movements develop
and grow: work on FOSS for a living. In doing this I've developed my
thoughts about the feasibility of such an endeavour, I've refined how I feel
about working in very small teams, I've learnt a lot of useful lessons I'm
going to draw on in the future (keeping a journal of my experience has been
a great move; I have a lot of notes and thoughts written down that I'll be
reviewing and distilling for myself over the coming weeks).</p>
<p>Most of all: it's been an absolute blast working on something that people
are actually using to build <a href="https://github.com/davep/transcendent-textual">cool
things</a>, and to <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/help/">provide help
and guidance to those people when they've needed
it</a>.</p>
<p>So... what happens now? Well, of course, right now, I'm looking for a new
position. If you're reading this and you are looking for someone who's kinda
handy with Python <a href="https://github.com/davep">and a bunch of other languages</a>
and who loves learning new stuff, or if you know someone who is looking for
such a person, <a href="mailto:davep@davep.co.uk">do drop me a line</a>!</p>
<p>As for what happens with Textual, and my involvement with it...</p>
<p>Well, what happens <em>with</em> Textual is
<a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan">Will</a>'s call, of course. As for my
involvement with it: I care about FOSS and I care about Textual; I also care
about the folk who have been kind enough to use their time to explore it,
test it, build with it, commit to it and make neat stuff with it. My
intention, as long as free time allows, is to carry on being involved, both
on GitHub and in <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">the Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>It's my sincere hope that, as a community of FOSS-friendly developers, we
see Textual over the 1.0 line and beyond.</p>
<p>But all that starts next week. It's a bank holiday weekend and I think I
might have deserved a run, a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">mucking about in
VR</a>, a beer, and just a wee bit of
down time.</p></div>
