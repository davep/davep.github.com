  <div>
      <div><p>Although it's not planned this way, so far it looks like I'm on a "every
other day" release cycle with Tinboard right now! Today's release is a small
but handy one, I think.</p>
<p>Thanks to the handy little library
<a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip"><code>pyperclip</code></a> I've added:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to copy a bookmark's URL to the clipboard.</li>
<li>URL field autofill if you go to add a new bookmark and the clipboard
  appears to have a valid URL in it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The code for copying to the clipboard" src="/attachments/2023/12/25/copy-to-clipboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>At the moment the copy facility is just a straightforward copy of the URL,
nothing else. At some point I may add an extended copy option, which will
open a dialog with a bunch of options of what to copy from the bookmark, and
perhaps also how to format it or something. Like, often, if I'm copying a
bookmark's URL, it's because I want to paste it into some Markdown document,
or some location that will handle Markdown markup.</p>
<p>Perhaps that'll turn up in v0.5.0 in a couple of days? ;-)</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on
GitHub</a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It looks like I'm in a wee period of small incremental changes and release
of <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a>. This morning I've release v0.3.0,
which has a couple of small but useful changes.</p>
<p>The first is more of a cosmetic thing. The <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/footer/"><code>Footer</code> widget in
Textual</a> is handy for showing
the current keyboard bindings in a given context, but it can get massively
cluttered very quickly (we do have plans to revisit this); in Tinboard this
clutter creep was turning into a thing.</p>
<p>So I've removed almost every binding from being displayed in the <code>Footer</code>,
and have placed an emphasis on the user pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> to get
context-sensitive help, and have also left the most useful bindings in the
footer with very minimal descriptions.</p>
<p>Given that this is a keyboard-first application, and I've tried to make the
bindings easy to remember, I think it's going to make more sense to do it
like this, and will make for a tidier UI too.</p>
<p>There is one disadvantage here of course: by removing the display of
bindings from the footer, the mouse-heavy user becomes disadvantaged; if a
particular binding doesn't have a UI feature that favours the mouse to cover
it too there's no way to initiate that action with the mouse. I'm going to
think on this a little. Again, Tinboard is designed for <em>me</em> first and
foremost, and my preference is to be keyboard-first when using the
application; but finding a good compromise would be advantageous when it
comes to advising people asking about Textual application design.</p>
<p>The second change is a simple but useful one. I've added a toggle of the
sort order of the tags menu in the left-hand column (bound to
<kbd>F4</kbd>). Right now it simply toggles between alphabetical order, or
bookmark count order (most to least). At some point I might make it more of
a cycle than a toggle, but this serves my purposes for now.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on

  <div>
      <div><p>Following on from <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">the initial full release a couple of days
ago</a>, I've just <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0">released v0.2.0 of
Tinboard</a>. There's
just one small change in this, but I think it's a really useful one.</p>
<p>In the top-left corner of the screen there's a menu of main filters, letting
you switch between seeing all bookmarks, or a combination of read, unread,
public, private, etc... In using the application I quickly realised that it
would be handy to have bookmark counts in that menu.</p>
<p>So I added that:</p>
<p><img alt="Counts in the filters menu" src="/attachments/2023/12/21/filters-menu.png#centre"></p>
<p>These counts are a little different from those in the tags list, in that
they always show the number of matching bookmarks amongst <em>all recorded
bookmarks</em>, not just those currently on display (and so subject to any sort
of filter that's in play).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this is the right approach here. I know for sure that that's what
I want from this, and I am writing this for me after all...</p>
<p>What's handy about this is that it makes it easier for me to see how many
bookmarks haven't been tagged, and also how many I haven't looked back over
and marked as read. This is already helping me get to untagged-zero.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new pet project, in part done
as a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> "dogfooding" project, but
also because this is a tool I've been wanting for a while now: a
terminal-based client for the <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard bookmarking
service</a>.</p>
<p>The dogfooding side of the development has been helping, uncovering a couple
of fun bugs in Textual; plus the act of building this has let me try out a
few of the newer features we've recently added to the framework.</p>
<p>What's <em>really</em> important though is this is a tool I actually <strong>wanted</strong>,
and I'm using pretty often. I've written a <em>lot</em> of Textual-based
applications over the past year, most small examples, <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth">some quite a bit
bigger</a>, but none of them really
form part of my daily workflow. This changes with Tinboard.</p>
<p><img alt="Tinboard in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tinboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard is designed as a fully-featured client, allowing for the creation
of new Bookmarks, complete with tag suggestion support:</p>
<p><img alt="Adding a new bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/new-bookmark.png#centre"></p>
<p>Not only are tag suggestions pulled from Pinboard, but entry of tags can
auto-complete, taking completions from both the suggested tags and also tags
used amongst your own bookmarks:</p>
<p><img alt="Auto-complete of tags" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tag-suggest.gif#centre"></p>
<p>That feature was really easy to add thanks to <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/suggester/">the <code>Suggester</code>
API</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/21/textual-0380-adds-a-syntax-aware-textarea/">recently-added</a>
<code>TextArea</code> widget the add/edit dialog allows for proper full editing of the
extended text description of the bookmark too:</p>
<p><img alt="Editing a bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/edit.png#centre"></p>
<p>One caveat here is a lack of word-wrapping; but this will be arriving in an
update to Textual early in the new year.</p>
<p>As well as all the usual add/edit/delete facilities, Tinboard is also
designed to make it pretty easy to find bookmarks too. There are filtering
options for seeing all read/unread, public/private and tagged/untagged
bookmarks; this makes bookmark management really easy for me because I can
filter for all the untagged and private bookmarks, which are likely the ones
that need editing and expanding on, and tidy up my bookmark library.</p>
<p>There is also, of course, full text search too.</p>
<p><img alt="Text search entry" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-entry.png#centre"></p>
<p>When a filter or search is in operation, the related tags and the like react
too:</p>
<p><img alt="A search result being shown" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-result.png#centre"></p>
<p>Another thing I've made a point of doing in Tinboard is leaning pretty hard
on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/command_palette/">Command
Palette</a>. No
functionality is <em>only</em> available by it (I've done my best to make sure that
keyboard is the primary input device here, with keyboard shortcuts for as
much as possible). Initially I approached this as a "for the sake of
completeness" feature, but already I'm finding that it's a pretty quick
method of pulling up a tag filter.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/command-palette.png#centre"></p>
<p>To help make all the features as discoverable possible, I've also ensured
there's a pretty comprehensive help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="Help" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/help.png#centre"></p>
<p>Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's a few more things I'd like to add. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">via GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>tinboard
</code></pre></div>

<p>I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This follows on from my <a href="/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html">previous post</a>.
If you've not read that, it's worth having a dive in first for the
background.</p>
<p>The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair
of scripts. The first one, called <code>selection</code>, did what <code>visual-selection</code>
does, only <code>visual-selection</code> does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a
random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target
phrase.</p>
<p>As covered before: I don't remember all of the details of the conversation
that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the
lines of <em>"yes, but you start out and end up with something the same
length"</em> and <em>"nothing more complex is made"</em> (let's gloss over the whole
"complex" thing for now... well okay let's just gloss over it, end of story;
this is just a fun coding exercise).</p>
<p>What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about
I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the
"fitness landscape" that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a
population over and over and see what happens. Would I "randomly" create
known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters?</p>
<p>So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would
randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a
random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that
aren't in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival
within the landscape).</p>
<p>Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun
to write some code.</p>
<p>This version became <code>selection2</code>.</p>
<p>So, having turned <code>selection</code> into a TUI application with Textual, I <em>had</em>
to do the same with this code...</p>
<p><img alt="Evolve Words" src="/attachments/2023/10/31/evolve-words.png#centre"></p>
<p>As before, because it's fun to do so, this leans heavily on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a> and
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/evolve-words">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/evolve-words/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p></div>

      <div><p>Over the last few weeks I've had a couple of sessions of working on a
library to wrap <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plotext/">Plotext</a> -- a popular
terminal-based plotting library for Python -- so that it can easily be used
in Textual apps;
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>
is the result.</p>
<p>I feel it's come together pretty well</p>
<p>But... I've been itching to find a reason to use it in a project of my own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Back in the mid-2000s, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB</a>
systems were still the fashion, I used to hang out on a site that was
chiefly aimed at the atheist and secular humanist crowd. We'd get a good
number of drive-by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism">YEC</a> types who'd
want to argue (sorry... debate) and often talk nonsense about biology and
the like.</p>
<p>Now, I'm no biologist, I'm no scientist, I'm just a hacker who likes to
write code for fun and profit; so any time there was a chance to write some
code to help illustrate an idea I'd jump at the chance. I forget the detail
now -- this was back in 2008; 15 years ago as of the time of writing -- but
one time I remember a conversation was taking place where someone was just
flat out claiming that "random mutation" can only cause "loss of
information" and could never lead to a "desired result", or some such thing.</p>
<p>If you've ever had, read or watched those debates, you'll know the sort of
thing I mean.</p>
<p>So that got me thinking back then, could I write something that could give a
simple illustration of how this doesn't quite make sense?</p>
<p>So I had a little hacking session and came up with some Ruby code<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> that
did what I felt was the job. You'd give it a phrase you wanted it to
generate (a stand-in for the current "fitness landscape", in effect), it
would then generate a totally random string of that length, and then would
set about mutating it, finding mutations that were "fitter" than others (a
stand in for selection), breed the best two so far (randomly copy one chunk
from another to create a child), then repeat over and over.</p>
<p>When I first wrote it I wasn't sure what to expect; would it ever finish
given a reasonably large target string?</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>It was fun to code.</p>
<p>It got posted to the BB and of course wasn't in any way persuasive to them
(honestly I never expected it would be). I seem to recall it being
hand-waved away with calls of there obviously being an intelligent designer
involved<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the "meanwhile..." in this: a few times this year I've thought it
could be fun to rework this in Python (it's really not that complex after
all; just a string-chopping loop really) and use Textual to put a fun UI on
it.</p>
<p>So, that's what I did, complete with <code>textual-plotext</code> plot:</p>
<p><img alt="Visual Selection in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/26/visual-selection.png"></p>
<p>While, 15 years on, this isn't going to convince anyone of the underlying
point, I think it does serve a good educational purpose. It shows that you
can create a fun UI for the terminal, with Textual, with not a lot of code.
It also shows off how you can easily create dynamic plots. Plus -- and I
think this might be the really important one -- it shows you can write
"traditional" tight-loop code in a Textual application and <em>still</em> have a
responsive UI; all thanks to the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a>.</p>
<p>The heart of the code for this application is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">environment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;This is the target string we want to create!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_fit_found</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shit_happens</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sure, there's some detail in the <code>Environment</code> class, but you get the idea:
while we've not hit the target, let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg">life find a
way</a>. A loop like that would
totally bog down an application with a UI without some other work taking
place. With Textual and workers the resulting method in the application,
complete with code to send updates to the UI, really doesn't look much
different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@work</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thread</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exclusive</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>

            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">post_message</span><span class="p">(</span>

            <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_fit_found</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">post_message</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Finished</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">iterations</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I honestly think the worker API is one of the coolest things added to
Textual and I so often see people have real <em>"woah!"</em> moments when they get
to grips with it.</p>
<p>Anyway... I've covered science, religion, and how Ruby is better than
Python, so I'm sure I've annoyed almost everyone. Job done I guess. ;-)</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/visual-selection">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/visual-selection/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p>
<p>Expect it to be my tinker project of choice for a wee while; there's a
couple of other things I'd like to add to it.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview"><code>textual-astare</code></a> is another
Textual-based Python project that I've developed in the last year and I
don't believe I've mentioned on this blog. Simply put, it's a took for
viewing the abstract syntax tree of Python code, in the terminal.</p>
<p><img alt="astare in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/10/astare.png#centre"></p>
<p>I've just made a small update to it this evening after someone asked <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions/12">for a
sensible change I've been meaning to do for a
while</a>. When I
first read the request I <em>was</em> going to look at it next week, when I have
some time off work, but you know how it is when you sit at your desk and
have a "quick look".</p>
<p>So anyway, yeah, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-astview/">v0.8.0</a> is out
there and can be installed, with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a></li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.39.0"><code>textual</code></a></li>
<li>Made it so you can open a directory to browser from the command line.</li>
<li>Made opening the current working directory the default.</li>
<li>Tweaked the way dark/light mode get toggled so that it's now
  command-palette-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the code does need a wee bit of tidying -- this was one of my
earliest apps built with Textual and my approach to writing Textual apps has
changed a fair bit this year, and Textual itself has grown and improved in
that time -- but it's still working well for now.</p></div>

      <div><p>I don't think I've mentioned it before on this blog, but some time back I
decided it would be fun to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> to
write a Mandelbrot explorer (simple Mandelbrot explorers have been another
one of my favourite <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">known problem to try an unknown
thing</a> problems). Doing it in the
terminal seemed like a fun little hack. I started off with creating
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas"><code>textual-canvas</code></a> and then built
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot"><code>textual-mandelbrot</code></a> on top
of that.</p>
<p>Not too long back <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/15/textual-0370-adds-a-command-palette/">I added a "command palette" to
Textual</a>
(I'd prefer to call it a minibuffer, but I get that that's not fashionable
these days), but so far I've not used it in any of my own projects; earlier
today I thought it could be fun to add it to <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mandelbrot commands in action" src="/attachments/2023/09/29/mandelbrot-commands.png#centre"></p>
<p>Most of the commands I've added are trivial and really better covered by
(and are covered by) keystrokes, but it was a good test and a way to show
off how to create a command provider.</p>
<p>Having started this I can see some more useful things to add: for example it
might be interesting to add a facility where you can bookmark a specific
location, zoom level, iteration value, etc, and revisit later. The command
palette would feel like a great way to pull back those bookmarks.</p>
<p>What I really liked though was how <em>easy</em> this was to do. <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot/blob/main/textual_mandelbrot/commands.py">The code to make
the commands
available</a>
is pretty trivial and, I believe, easy to follow. Although I do say so
myself I think I managed to design a very accessible API for this.</p>
<p>There's more I'd like to add to that (the Textual command palette itself, I
mean), of course; this was just the start. Support for commands that accept
and prompt for arguments would be a neat and obvious enhancement (especially
if done in a way that's reminiscent of how commands could be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager">CLIM</a> -- I
remember <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-cldict/">really liking</a> how you
could create self-documenting and self-completing commands in that).</p>
<p>All in good time...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since <a href="/2023/09/01/textual-query-sandbox.html">quickly hacking together <code>textual-query-sandbox</code> a few days
back</a>, I've made a bunch of small
changes here and there. While most have been cosmetic and playing with some
ideas, some have also been internal improvements that should make the tool
work better.</p>
<p>The most prominent change is one I pondered in the previous post, where I
thought it might be interesting to have a small collection of playgrounds
grounded together with a <code>TabbedContent</code>. So as of now the tool still has
the original playground which had an emphasis on nested containers:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 1" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-1.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's now a playground with an emphasis on selecting widgets within
containers<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 2" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-2.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's also now a playground that has an emphasis on pulling out widgets
based on ID and classes:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 3" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-3.png#centre"></p>
<p>The other change you will notice from the original post is the DOM tree
shown in the bottom right corner. Note that that isn't there to show your
query result (that's the bottom left panel), it's there to help picture how
the DOM in the current playground hangs together, and will hopefully help in
picturing the structure for when you write a query.</p>
<p>I sense there's still a lot of fun things I could add to this, and I'm still
keen on the idea of having the playgrounds "soft coded" in some way, so
people can make their own and load them up.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to try and work on is making the display as useful as
possible. While I think it's actually pretty neat and clear, there's not a
<em>lot</em> of space<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> available to show the playground and the results. Finding
a good balance is an interesting problem.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons this is turning into a really enjoyable tinker
project.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This is, of course, slightly nonsensical wording. Containers <em>are</em>
widgets in Textual. Pretty much everything you see in your terminal is a
widget, even a <code>Screen</code> is a widget.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>A lot of this of course hinges on how big someone's terminal is. I
tend to run a fairly high resolutions with the smallest font I find
readable so my terminal windows are often pretty "big"; other people
tend to have something much smaller in terms of cell with/height.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Sometimes I can have an idea for a Textual widget, library or application on
my ideas list for weeks, months even, before I get around to it -- mostly
just due to not having the clear time to make a run at getting it going --
and then other times an idea can pop into my head and it <em>has</em> to be created
there and then. <strong>Has</strong> to be!</p>
<p>This happened yesterday evening.</p>
<p>While the tool I built is something I'd thought of before (back around
November last year I think) it hadn't even made it to my <em>"list of stuff I
should make"</em> that I keep in Apple Reminders; not sure why really. But then
yesterday evening a question cropped up on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Textual Discord
server</a> that related to the subject and I was
reminded of it.</p>
<p>The subject being: <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/">Textual DOM
queries</a>. I like to think that
DOM queries in Textual are pretty easy to do, and well-explained in the
docs, but it's fair to admit that they need a bit of practice first, just
like any powerful tool. So I was reminded that I'd wanted to write a sandbox
application, that would have a practice DOM inside it, an input field to
type in a query, and a way of displaying the results.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-query-sandbox"><code>textual-query-sandbox</code></a>
was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Query Sandbox" src="/attachments/2023/09/01/tqs.png#centre"></p>
<p>In this very first version (which was <em>really</em> quickly put together -- it
was something like 15 minutes to write the main code and then probably 45
minutes tweaking styles, adding all the admin stuff to allow <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-query-sandbox/">deployment to
PyPi</a> and writing the
README) there's an <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/input/"><code>Input</code></a>,
a display of a group of nested containers with different IDs and classes,
and then a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/pretty/"><code>Pretty</code></a> widget
at the bottom to show the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/#query-objects"><code>query</code></a>
result.</p>
<p>If you think this looks like it might be useful to you, it can be installed
using either <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-query-sandbox
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then you can run it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>tqs
</code></pre></div>

<p>At which point load up the Textual query docs, type queries into the input
field, hit enter and see what gets highlighted and which widgets end up in
the result set at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Like I say: this was a quick hack yesterday evening, I think there's a lot
more can go into this. For one thing I think a more interesting practice DOM
would be a good idea, with a good mix of widgets; another thing could be
having a collection of different DOM playgrounds that can be switched
between (a <code>TabbedContent</code> of different playgrounds could be fun here); this
could even be taken further such that the user can create their own
playground DOM to practice against.</p>
<p>Eventually it would be neat if this could be turned into a library that can
be included in a Textual application, as a development-time debug tool, so

version probably covers 90% of the use cases for something like this; making
for a really quick and easy tool to double-check how to query something.</p></div>
