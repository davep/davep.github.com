      <div><p>Just a wee catch-up post about OSHit, <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit">my terminal-based HackerNews
browser</a>. Over the past couple of weeks I've
made some small changes, so I thought I'd make mention of what I've done.</p>
<p>As of v0.5.0, which I released earlier today, I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a quick way of following links while viewing a comment. While a
  comment is highlighted you can press <kbd>l</kbd> to follow a link; if
  there's more than one link in the comment a menu will be shown and you can
  select which one to follow.</li>
<li>Added support for viewing polls. Polls seem to be few and far between on
  HackerNews, so when I published the first version of OSHit I didn't have
  one to hand to test any code against. Eventually one turned up and broke
  OSHit (on purpose; I wanted to see when that happened) so I could then add
  the code to load polls and show them. Right now it just shows scores; I
  might do actual charts at some point.</li>
<li>Added optional item numbers in the lists; turned on/off with
  <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far all small things, but handy little improvements. There's still a nice
TODO list in the README and I will slowly work through it. Along with
<a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">tinboard</a> these are two applications
that have absolutely turned into "daily drivers", so they're going to get a
lot of tweaking over the next few weeks, probably even months.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This is actually the second release of OSHit since <a href="/2024/01/01/oshit.html">I first announced it a
week back</a>, and I'll get to that other release in a
moment.</p>
<p>I've just published v0.2.0, which isn't a very substantial release, but
which bumps the required version of Textual to
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.1">v0.47.1</a> and
has some fun with <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.0">the new nested CSS
feature</a>.</p>
<p>Underlying the point of this release was me taking a <em>"real world"</em>
application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in
part to get a feel for how and when it's useful, but also to give it a
proper test in a <em>"proper"</em> application. In doing so <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3969">I think I've found one
bug</a>.</p>
<p>Dogfooding is always a good idea.</p>
<p>The main visible change in this release is I've played around with the look
of the comments dialog a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="OSHit you have comments" src="/attachments/2024/01/07/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I'm still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I
started out with.</p>
<p>Another change I made was also to the comments dialog. Before, if you
performed the <em>"expand comments"</em> action on a comment card that already had
its comments expanded, it would move focus to the first child comment; this
was a deliberate choice that felt right at the time. Having used the app for
a few days now I've realised that making it an open/close toggle is far more
useful. So that's what I've done.</p>
<p>Now... as for <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/releases/tag/v0.1.1">the previous
release</a> I mentioned
above. That was a fun one.</p>
<p>Back when I released v0.1.0 some joker decided that it would be fun to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38831083">submit the blog post about it to the Orange
Site</a>. The comments there
went as you'd expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph, ignoring the tool itself.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in self-reflective way.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in a <em>"I never see the problem"</em>
  way.</li>
<li>One or two did the usual <em>"why even bother building that when
  <code>$TOOL_OF_CHOICE</code> exists?"</em> dance to show their terminal purity.</li>
<li>One or two posted genuinely useful links to other similar projects.</li>
<li>The biggest tree of comments was kind of a fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>One comment caught my eye though; someone reported having a problem running
it. My initial thought on reading it was <em>"my dude, seriously, you're going
to report the problem in some random comment on HN rather than raise an
issue with the author?!?"</em>.</p>
<p>For once <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues/2">I was wrong to be so cynical</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I'd been intentionally
reckless while writing the original code, and hadn't <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/pull/4">gone back to the API
code I'd written and made it behave</a>
before doing the initial release.</p>
<p>All of which is to say: if you run into a problem with some FOSS project, be
like <a href="https://github.com/mihaitodor">@mihaitodor</a>. Issue that thing so the
developer gets to know about it; don't assume they'll be reading some random
comment section, social media site or Discord server!</p>
<p>That and don't make 500+ HTTP requests at once; that might not end well for
some.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I know I'm not alone in having a relationship with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">the orange
site</a> that is... weird. I generally dislike
the culture there, it's almost impossible to read any of the comments
without being frustrated about the industry I work in or am adjacent to and
some of the people who inhabit it; but as a link aggregator of stuff I might
find interesting... I honestly can't think of anywhere better. So, yes, I've
been a fairly avid reader of HackerNews for many years, and have even had an
account there for over 4 years.</p>
<p>Given this, for a wee while now, I've been meaning to knock up a
terminal-based client for it using
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a>.</p>
<p>So after work on <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a> settled down I got
the urge to start a new pet project (not abandoning Tinboard, I'm still
going to be tweaking and extending it of course) and finally knocking up
that client seemed like the one.</p>
<p><em>Orange Site Hit</em> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="OShit" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index.png"></p>
<p>It's worth making clear from the very start: this is a read-only reader.
There is no logging in, there is no voting, there is no posting of things.
This is a client built with <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">their own
API</a> and it doesn't provide such a thing;
at least not now and despite me seeing past promises that this will change,
there's no API for doing that sort of thing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea of this application is you can run it up in the terminal, check the
top, best and latest from the categories provided by the API, perhaps dive
off into your web browser if needed, and then got on with other things.</p>
<p>It's there for when you're in the terminal you just <em>need</em> your hit of the
orange site.</p>
<p>The main screen of the app revolves around the index of items, most of which
are going to be stories. You can see an example of that above. For people
who prefer things to be slightly less cramped, I've also added a "relaxed
layout" mode too:</p>
<p><img alt="The index in relaxed mode" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index-relaxed.png"></p>
<p>From the index you can head off into your web-browser by hitting
<kbd>Enter</kbd> on any item; if the item is a story that links to somewhere
that link will be opened; if it's something more like <em>AskHN</em>, or a job,
it'll open the related page on HackerNews itself.</p>
<p>Pressing <kbd>u</kbd> with an item selected will let you view the details
for the user who posted the item:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the details of a user" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-user-dialog.png"></p>
<p>If you're the sort of person who wants to torture themselves by reading the
comments (oh come on we all do it!), there's a comment reader/navigator too.
With an item selected press <kbd>c</kbd> and the comment dialog will open:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the real meat of HackerNews" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the navigation within that dialog is fine; although I can see some
scope for improvement. At the moment it uses a widget-per-comment (actually,
it's at least 4 widgets per comment), which is fine and Textual handles that
without an issue, even on items with lots of comments, but longer-term I can
see me having some fun using <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#line-api">the line
API</a> to build a
super-efficient comment presentation and navigation widget.</p>
<p>That's it for now; it feels like a good v0.1.0 spot to be in. There are a
bunch of things I still want to do with it (better cleaning up of the text,
perhaps with some markup support so links get handled, etc; plus lots of
ways of searching for stuff), but I felt it was in a place where I could
start using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oshit/">from PyPi</a>. The
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit">source is available over on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <div><p>Although it's not planned this way, so far it looks like I'm on a "every
other day" release cycle with Tinboard right now! Today's release is a small
but handy one, I think.</p>
<p>Thanks to the handy little library
<a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip"><code>pyperclip</code></a> I've added:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to copy a bookmark's URL to the clipboard.</li>
<li>URL field autofill if you go to add a new bookmark and the clipboard
  appears to have a valid URL in it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The code for copying to the clipboard" src="/attachments/2023/12/25/copy-to-clipboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>At the moment the copy facility is just a straightforward copy of the URL,
nothing else. At some point I may add an extended copy option, which will
open a dialog with a bunch of options of what to copy from the bookmark, and
perhaps also how to format it or something. Like, often, if I'm copying a
bookmark's URL, it's because I want to paste it into some Markdown document,
or some location that will handle Markdown markup.</p>
<p>Perhaps that'll turn up in v0.5.0 in a couple of days? ;-)</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from

  <div>
      <div><p>It looks like I'm in a wee period of small incremental changes and release
of <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a>. This morning I've release v0.3.0,
which has a couple of small but useful changes.</p>
<p>The first is more of a cosmetic thing. The <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/footer/"><code>Footer</code> widget in
Textual</a> is handy for showing
the current keyboard bindings in a given context, but it can get massively
cluttered very quickly (we do have plans to revisit this); in Tinboard this
clutter creep was turning into a thing.</p>
<p>So I've removed almost every binding from being displayed in the <code>Footer</code>,
and have placed an emphasis on the user pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> to get
context-sensitive help, and have also left the most useful bindings in the
footer with very minimal descriptions.</p>
<p>Given that this is a keyboard-first application, and I've tried to make the
bindings easy to remember, I think it's going to make more sense to do it
like this, and will make for a tidier UI too.</p>
<p>There is one disadvantage here of course: by removing the display of
bindings from the footer, the mouse-heavy user becomes disadvantaged; if a
particular binding doesn't have a UI feature that favours the mouse to cover
it too there's no way to initiate that action with the mouse. I'm going to
think on this a little. Again, Tinboard is designed for <em>me</em> first and
foremost, and my preference is to be keyboard-first when using the
application; but finding a good compromise would be advantageous when it
comes to advising people asking about Textual application design.</p>
<p>The second change is a simple but useful one. I've added a toggle of the
sort order of the tags menu in the left-hand column (bound to
<kbd>F4</kbd>). Right now it simply toggles between alphabetical order, or
bookmark count order (most to least). At some point I might make it more of
a cycle than a toggle, but this serves my purposes for now.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on

      <div><p>Following on from <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">the initial full release a couple of days
ago</a>, I've just <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0">released v0.2.0 of
Tinboard</a>. There's
just one small change in this, but I think it's a really useful one.</p>
<p>In the top-left corner of the screen there's a menu of main filters, letting
you switch between seeing all bookmarks, or a combination of read, unread,
public, private, etc... In using the application I quickly realised that it
would be handy to have bookmark counts in that menu.</p>
<p>So I added that:</p>
<p><img alt="Counts in the filters menu" src="/attachments/2023/12/21/filters-menu.png#centre"></p>
<p>These counts are a little different from those in the tags list, in that
they always show the number of matching bookmarks amongst <em>all recorded
bookmarks</em>, not just those currently on display (and so subject to any sort
of filter that's in play).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this is the right approach here. I know for sure that that's what
I want from this, and I am writing this for me after all...</p>
<p>What's handy about this is that it makes it easier for me to see how many
bookmarks haven't been tagged, and also how many I haven't looked back over
and marked as read. This is already helping me get to untagged-zero.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new pet project, in part done
as a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> "dogfooding" project, but
also because this is a tool I've been wanting for a while now: a
terminal-based client for the <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard bookmarking
service</a>.</p>
<p>The dogfooding side of the development has been helping, uncovering a couple
of fun bugs in Textual; plus the act of building this has let me try out a
few of the newer features we've recently added to the framework.</p>
<p>What's <em>really</em> important though is this is a tool I actually <strong>wanted</strong>,
and I'm using pretty often. I've written a <em>lot</em> of Textual-based
applications over the past year, most small examples, <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth">some quite a bit
bigger</a>, but none of them really
form part of my daily workflow. This changes with Tinboard.</p>
<p><img alt="Tinboard in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tinboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard is designed as a fully-featured client, allowing for the creation
of new Bookmarks, complete with tag suggestion support:</p>
<p><img alt="Adding a new bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/new-bookmark.png#centre"></p>
<p>Not only are tag suggestions pulled from Pinboard, but entry of tags can
auto-complete, taking completions from both the suggested tags and also tags
used amongst your own bookmarks:</p>
<p><img alt="Auto-complete of tags" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tag-suggest.gif#centre"></p>
<p>That feature was really easy to add thanks to <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/suggester/">the <code>Suggester</code>
API</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/21/textual-0380-adds-a-syntax-aware-textarea/">recently-added</a>
<code>TextArea</code> widget the add/edit dialog allows for proper full editing of the
extended text description of the bookmark too:</p>
<p><img alt="Editing a bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/edit.png#centre"></p>
<p>One caveat here is a lack of word-wrapping; but this will be arriving in an
update to Textual early in the new year.</p>
<p>As well as all the usual add/edit/delete facilities, Tinboard is also
designed to make it pretty easy to find bookmarks too. There are filtering
options for seeing all read/unread, public/private and tagged/untagged
bookmarks; this makes bookmark management really easy for me because I can
filter for all the untagged and private bookmarks, which are likely the ones
that need editing and expanding on, and tidy up my bookmark library.</p>
<p>There is also, of course, full text search too.</p>
<p><img alt="Text search entry" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-entry.png#centre"></p>
<p>When a filter or search is in operation, the related tags and the like react
too:</p>
<p><img alt="A search result being shown" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-result.png#centre"></p>
<p>Another thing I've made a point of doing in Tinboard is leaning pretty hard
on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/command_palette/">Command
Palette</a>. No
functionality is <em>only</em> available by it (I've done my best to make sure that
keyboard is the primary input device here, with keyboard shortcuts for as
much as possible). Initially I approached this as a "for the sake of
completeness" feature, but already I'm finding that it's a pretty quick
method of pulling up a tag filter.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/command-palette.png#centre"></p>
<p>To help make all the features as discoverable possible, I've also ensured
there's a pretty comprehensive help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="Help" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/help.png#centre"></p>
<p>Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's a few more things I'd like to add. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">via GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>tinboard
</code></pre></div>

<p>I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This follows on from my <a href="/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html">previous post</a>.
If you've not read that, it's worth having a dive in first for the
background.</p>
<p>The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair
of scripts. The first one, called <code>selection</code>, did what <code>visual-selection</code>
does, only <code>visual-selection</code> does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a
random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target
phrase.</p>
<p>As covered before: I don't remember all of the details of the conversation
that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the
lines of <em>"yes, but you start out and end up with something the same
length"</em> and <em>"nothing more complex is made"</em> (let's gloss over the whole
"complex" thing for now... well okay let's just gloss over it, end of story;
this is just a fun coding exercise).</p>
<p>What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about
I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the
"fitness landscape" that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a
population over and over and see what happens. Would I "randomly" create
known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters?</p>
<p>So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would
randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a
random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that
aren't in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival
within the landscape).</p>
<p>Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun
to write some code.</p>
<p>This version became <code>selection2</code>.</p>
<p>So, having turned <code>selection</code> into a TUI application with Textual, I <em>had</em>
to do the same with this code...</p>
<p><img alt="Evolve Words" src="/attachments/2023/10/31/evolve-words.png#centre"></p>
<p>As before, because it's fun to do so, this leans heavily on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a> and
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/evolve-words">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/evolve-words/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the last few weeks I've had a couple of sessions of working on a
library to wrap <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plotext/">Plotext</a> -- a popular
terminal-based plotting library for Python -- so that it can easily be used
in Textual apps;
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>
is the result.</p>
<p>I feel it's come together pretty well</p>
<p>But... I've been itching to find a reason to use it in a project of my own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Back in the mid-2000s, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB</a>
systems were still the fashion, I used to hang out on a site that was
chiefly aimed at the atheist and secular humanist crowd. We'd get a good
number of drive-by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism">YEC</a> types who'd
want to argue (sorry... debate) and often talk nonsense about biology and
the like.</p>
<p>Now, I'm no biologist, I'm no scientist, I'm just a hacker who likes to
write code for fun and profit; so any time there was a chance to write some
code to help illustrate an idea I'd jump at the chance. I forget the detail
now -- this was back in 2008; 15 years ago as of the time of writing -- but
one time I remember a conversation was taking place where someone was just
flat out claiming that "random mutation" can only cause "loss of
information" and could never lead to a "desired result", or some such thing.</p>
<p>If you've ever had, read or watched those debates, you'll know the sort of
thing I mean.</p>
<p>So that got me thinking back then, could I write something that could give a
simple illustration of how this doesn't quite make sense?</p>
<p>So I had a little hacking session and came up with some Ruby code<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> that
did what I felt was the job. You'd give it a phrase you wanted it to
generate (a stand-in for the current "fitness landscape", in effect), it
would then generate a totally random string of that length, and then would
set about mutating it, finding mutations that were "fitter" than others (a
stand in for selection), breed the best two so far (randomly copy one chunk
from another to create a child), then repeat over and over.</p>
<p>When I first wrote it I wasn't sure what to expect; would it ever finish
given a reasonably large target string?</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>It was fun to code.</p>
<p>It got posted to the BB and of course wasn't in any way persuasive to them
(honestly I never expected it would be). I seem to recall it being
hand-waved away with calls of there obviously being an intelligent designer
involved<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the "meanwhile..." in this: a few times this year I've thought it
could be fun to rework this in Python (it's really not that complex after
all; just a string-chopping loop really) and use Textual to put a fun UI on
it.</p>
<p>So, that's what I did, complete with <code>textual-plotext</code> plot:</p>
<p><img alt="Visual Selection in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/26/visual-selection.png"></p>
<p>While, 15 years on, this isn't going to convince anyone of the underlying
point, I think it does serve a good educational purpose. It shows that you
can create a fun UI for the terminal, with Textual, with not a lot of code.
It also shows off how you can easily create dynamic plots. Plus -- and I
think this might be the really important one -- it shows you can write
"traditional" tight-loop code in a Textual application and <em>still</em> have a
responsive UI; all thanks to the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a>.</p>
<p>The heart of the code for this application is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">environment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;This is the target string we want to create!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_fit_found</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shit_happens</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sure, there's some detail in the <code>Environment</code> class, but you get the idea:
while we've not hit the target, let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg">life find a
way</a>. A loop like that would
totally bog down an application with a UI without some other work taking
place. With Textual and workers the resulting method in the application,
complete with code to send updates to the UI, really doesn't look much
different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@work</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thread</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exclusive</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I honestly think the worker API is one of the coolest things added to
Textual and I so often see people have real <em>"woah!"</em> moments when they get
to grips with it.</p>
<p>Anyway... I've covered science, religion, and how Ruby is better than
Python, so I'm sure I've annoyed almost everyone. Job done I guess. ;-)</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/visual-selection">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/visual-selection/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p>
<p>Expect it to be my tinker project of choice for a wee while; there's a
couple of other things I'd like to add to it.</p>
