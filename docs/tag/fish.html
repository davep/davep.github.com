    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I first got into Python in the mid-to-late 1990s. It's so far back that I
think the copy of <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/">Programming
Python</a> that I have (sadly in
storage at the moment) might be a first edition. I probably fell out of the
habit of using Python some time in the early 2000s (that was when I met
Ruby). It was only 22 months ago that I started using Python a <em>lot</em> thanks
to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">a change of
employer</a>.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, much had changed in the 15+ years since I'd last
written a line of Python in anger. So, early on, I made a point of making
<a href="https://www.pylint.org/">Pylint</a> part of my development process. All my
projects have a <code>make lint</code> make target. All of my projects lint the code
when I push to <code>master</code> in the company GitLab instance. These days I even
use <a href="https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a> to keep me honest as I
write my code; mostly gone are the days where I don't know of problems until
I do a <code>make lint</code>.</p>
<p>Leaning on Pylint in the early days of my new position made for a great
Python refresher for me. Now, I still lean on it to make sure I don't make
daft mistakes.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Pylint and I don't always agree. And that's fine. For example, I really
can't stand Pylint's approach to whitespace, and that is a hill I'll happily
die on. Ditto the obsession with lines being no more than 80 characters wide
(120 should be fine thanks). As such any project's <code>.pylintrc</code> has, as a
bare minimum, this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[FORMAT]</span>
<span class="na">max-line-length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">120</span>

<span class="k">[MESSAGES CONTROL]</span>
<span class="na">disable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">bad-whitespace</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Beyond that though, aside from one or two extras that pertain to particular
projects, I'm happy with what Pylint complains about.</p>
<p>There are exceptions though. There are times, simply due to the nature of
the code involved, that Pylint's insistence on code purity isn't going to
work. That's where I use its inline <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html#block-disables">block disabling
feature</a>.
It's handy and helps keep things clean (I won't deploy code that doesn't
pass 10/10), but there is always this nagging doubt: if I've disabled a
warning in the code, am I ever going to come back and revisit it?</p>
<p>To help me think about coming back to such disables now and again, I thought
it might be interesting to write a tool that'll show which warnings I
disable most. It resulted in <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/dd2721e0565928b4145698a42c9c74e4534c578a/conf.d/abbr.d/python.fish#L5">this fish
abbr</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr<span class="w"> </span>-g<span class="w"> </span>pylintshame<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;rg --no-messages \&quot;pylint:disable=\&quot; | awk &#39;BEGIN{FS=\&quot;disable=\&quot;;}{print \$2}&#39; | tr \&quot;,\&quot; \&quot;\n\&quot; | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea here being that it produces a "Pylint hall of shame", something
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">wildcard</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">import</span>

<span class="w">   </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">arguments</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">differ</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To break the pipeline down:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rg --no-messages &quot;pylint:disable=&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>First off, I use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> (if you
don't, you might want to have a good look at it -- I find it amazingly
handy) to find everywhere in the code in and below the current directory
(the <code>--no-messages</code> switch just stops any file I/O errors that might result
from permission issues -- they're not interesting here) that contains a line
that has a Pylint block disable (if you tend to format yours differently,
you'll need to tweak the regular expression, of course).</p>
<p>I then pipe it through <code>awk</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">awk</span> <span class="s">&#39;BEGIN{FS=&quot;disable=&quot;;}{print $2}&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>so I can lazily <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/info/gawk/gawk.info.Field_Separators.html">extract everything after the
<code>disable=</code></a>.</p>
<p>Next up, because it's a possible list of things that can be disabled, I use
<code>tr</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>tr &quot;,&quot; &quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>to turn any comma-separated list into multiple lines.</p>
<p>Having got to this point, I <code>sort</code> the list, <code>uniq</code> the result, while
prepending a count (<code>-c</code>), and then <code>sort</code> the result again, in reverse and
sorting the numbers based on how a human would read the result (<code>-hr</code>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sort | uniq -c | sort -hr
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's short, sweet and hacky, but does the job quite nicely. From now on, any
time I get curious about which disables I'm leaning on too much, I can use
this to take stock.</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p><em>I'm filing this as a TIL because, while it wasn't T, I did L it very
recently and it was a new trick that impacted on around 25 years if prior
working practice.</em></p>
<p>I think it must have been around 1991 when I first encountered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS">4DOS</a>. While I'd used the odd Unix
shell here and there previously, it'd only been in passing. It was 4DOS that
first introduced me to the power of aliases on the command line. Many of the
aliases I set up and used in 4DOS still remain with me to this day, on
GNU/Linux and macOS, in some form or another.</p>
<p>I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone reading this why aliases and cool and
handy and pretty much vital if you do lots of work on the command line.</p>
<p>And then, a couple or so weeks ago, as a very recent convert to
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>, I discovered the
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#abbr"><code>abbr</code></a> command. At
first glance it didn't seem to make much sense. It was like
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#alias"><code>alias</code></a>, only it
expanded what you typed rather than acted as a command in its own right.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging and some of it started to make sense. One thing that
really won me over -- and while it's something that doesn't directly impact
on me -- was the argument that it allows for a far more transparent command
history; especially if you're likely to use a transcript of a shell session
in a place where people might not know or have access to your aliases.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a position where you have loads of handy and cool aliases,
but you also need to record what you've done so other people can follow your
work (does it show that I sit amongst people who maintain lab notebooks?);
it seems like it would be a bit of a bother needing to record all of the
aliases in your own work environment up front. Without that information few
people will be able to make sense of the recorded commands, with that
information they'd still need to double-check what each command does.</p>
<p>So imagine an alias that, when used, expands in place. Then you'd get all of
the benefit of aliases while also having a full and readable record of what
you <em>actually</em> did.</p>
<p>Seems neat!</p>
<p>Here's a silly example. For a long time I've carried around an alias called
<code>greedy</code> that runs something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's pretty straightforward: I'm using <code>du</code> to get a sense of which
directories are using what space, and then using <code>sort</code> to make a
worst-to-best-offender list out of it. So I could use an alias:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">greedy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;du -hs * | sort -rh&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The only downside to this is that, any time I run it, if I were to record
the shell session and make it available for someone else to read, they'd
just see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>greedy
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, with an abbreviation rather than an alias, I'd type <code>greedy</code> but as
soon as I hit <code>Enter</code> it'd get expanded to something anyone could read and
follow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is far from the only benefit of abbreviations; for most people it
probably isn't one of the most important ones, but I find it neat and
compelling and this alone drove me to rework almost all of my aliases as
abbreviations.</p>
<p>Having done that, I get other benefits too. For example, fish (like other
shells) has good support for argument completion for well-known commands.
The problem is, if you alias such a command, you don't get that completion.
With an abbreviation though you do! All you need to do is type the
abbreviation, hit <code>space</code> and it'll expand to the underlying command and
then the full range of completion can happen.</p>
<p>There's also one last reason why I like abbreviations over aliases, and it's
kind of a silly one, but in a good way. It's actually fun to see what you
type magically expand as you do things, it makes you look like you can type
even faster than you normally can! ;-)</p>
<p>PS: If you've never tried <code>fish</code> before and you're curious, it's easy to

      <div><p>These days <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> is my shell of choice. I started
out with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> back in the 1990s, went
through a bit of a
<a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>/<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> phase, but
earlier this year finally settled on fish.</p>
<p>At some point I might write a post about my fish config, and why fish works
well for me. But that's an idea for another time.</p>
<p>In this post I thought I'd share a little snippet of code that can come in
handy now and again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find myself inside a git repo, in the shell, and I want to get
to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29">forge</a>" for
that repo. This is most often either on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, or in
a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/">company-local installation of GitLab</a>.
To get there quickly I wrote
<a href="https://gist.github.com/davep/3bac3b30e45a3560c265150e609219db"><code>gh.fish</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">##############################################################################</span>
<span class="cp"># Attempt go visit the origin hub for the current repo.</span>

<span class="n">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">gh</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Visit the repo in its origin hub&quot;</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="cp"># Check that there is some sort of origin.</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">end</span>

<span class="n">end</span>

<span class="cp">### gh.fish ends here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea is pretty simple: I see if the repo has an origin of some
description and, if it has, I <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#string">slice and dice
it</a> into something
that looks like the URL you'd expect to find for a GitHub or GitLab repo.
Finally I use
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#open"><code>open</code></a> to open the
URL in the environment's browser of choice.</p></div>
