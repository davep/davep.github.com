  <div>
      <div><p>My journey into the Apple ecosystem has been gradual but all-consuming. I've
gone from, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">around a 8 years
ago</a>, being
unconvinced about how good the whole Apple world is, to pretty much having
all the hardware they make available, in some form, that I have an actual
use for<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the devices I was late to, but won over by, after moving away from
Android to iPhone, was the Apple Watch. These days I have two: the original
SE, and also a Series 8. Generally I've marvelled at just how seamless the
experience is. I swap watches: the connection to my phone "just works" and
it figures all that out. Stuff syncs. Stuff stays in sync.</p>
<p>I lean heavily on the watch. The Series 8 is my daily driver, and the SE
acts as my nighttime tracking device while the 8 charges and I sleep.</p>
<p>I record walks. I record runs. I record lots of heart rate data. I pay for
things, pretty much everything, with it. I... take it for granted really.</p>
<p><img alt="My main watch face" src="/attachments/2023/12/08/watch-face.png#centre"></p>
<p>Yesterday though, something odd started to happen. I noticed that some
things didn't seem to be syncing from my watch to the phone. Health-related
things weren't turning up. A recorded workout didn't show. The control of
all things audio seemed to decouple and the watch kept taking over use of my
AirPods from the phone in an annoying way I'd never experienced before.
Things like that.</p>
<p>I tried a reboot of the watch. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again. I tried a reboot of the phone. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again.</p>
<p>I then rebooted watch and phone, stuff seemed fine, and I didn't think much
more about it.</p>
<p>Then this morning I swapped from the SE back to the Series 8 as I sat down
for breakfast, my usual routine, and the syncing was failing <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>This, for me, this is when Apple stuff gets really frustrating. There's no
easy or obvious way to diagnose what's going on. Like: I could not sync some
health data from the watch to the phone, but I <em>could</em> use "Find My" to ping
the watch (presumably a difference in communication route, BT vs Wi-Fi
perhaps). There's no obvious error dialog. There's no obvious log to look
at. There's no "your BT is borked" alert or something.</p>
<p>Searching online the advice seemed to be the nuclear option: unpair the
watch, reset it, start again. So I've done that this morning and it's been
quite the pain. Getting it set up again was straightforward enough, but
having to go through the whole thing of dismissing all the <em>"here's some
tips on how to use this watch you've had for a year and used every day"</em>
cards was annoying, also having to set up my payment cards again was
annoying. Also, and this is on me for not backing them up recently, trying
to recreate my watch faces from memory and remembering which ones they were
based on was also annoying.</p>
<p>Apple are actually so good at a lot of this seamless shit; but damn do I
wish they'd also be good at making a tool that lets you easily and smoothly
diagnose some issues. I would imagine sync issues between watch and phone
are common enough that a wee tool where you run through diagnostics, and
where there's a Q&amp;A to help narrow down the issue, would be a great
experience.</p>
<p>Anyway... it seems to be up and running again, so hopefully that's that
issue solved. I tried a couple of things that would need to sync from the
watch to the phone and they showed up instantly; actually faster than I've
been used to for quite a while.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed...</p>

      <div><p>Following on from
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/06/25/did-google-just-break-wear-timers.html">yesterday's problem with the Android Wear timer</a>
I think I now have a solution. It came up
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/RZujypG7EyF">while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue</a>.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I've seen a number of
times before with Google stuff. One thing that's rather common (in many cases
for very obvious reasons -- you can't cover the whole world in one go) with
Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This
felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared
to be unaffected by the issue (I'm guessing he's on the latest version of
Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that
became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out
he was the same as me: British English.</p>
<p>So much for that idea.</p>
<p>But then he suggested switching to US English and back again.</p>
<p>Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft "turn it off and on again" approach to
a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and
really do suffer the same issues) I switched to en-US on the phone and tried
setting a timer in voice on the watch.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>So then I switched back to en-GB on the phone and...</p>
<p><img alt="I appear to have timers working again" src="/attachments/2015/06/26/Timer Running on Watch.png"></p>
<p>...it still worked!</p>
<p>I've tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it's yet
to fail.</p>
<p>It would appear, as odd as it is, that this is the fix. Well, a fix.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p></div>
