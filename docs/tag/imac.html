      <div><p>Over the past couple or so
weeks <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">my Macbook air</a> has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"></p>
<p>Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.</p>
<p>So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.</p>
<p>I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.</p>
<p>I joined the queue.</p>
<p>About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.</p>
<p>By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p>So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.</p>
<p>Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.</p>
<p>Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).</p>
<p>I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.</p>
<p>So I had to go and look.</p>
<p>Having looked I came away with one.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.</p>
<p>As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.</p>
<p>For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.</p>
<p>And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.</p></div>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier on today I needed a copy of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"><code>wget</code></a> on my iMac. It's not "native" to
it so I got to wondering how you go about getting something like that onto it.
Sure, I could have just grabbed the source and built myself, but really it's
a lot nicer to use some sort of package manager.</p>
<p>A quick search lead me to <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and I was then up and
running in no time.</p>
<p>This in turn got me to thinking about how it might be fun to get some of the
software I used to use on my GNU/Linux machine up and running again. The first
one that came to mind was <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/"><code>slrn</code></a>. Sure enough
slrn is available via Homebrew and installing it was dead simple.</p>
<p>But then I was faced with a problem: I needed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">NNTP</a> server.
Way back I used to run a local one in my office that fed from and to my
ISP's. Back then my ISP was Demon Internet; these days I'm with BT. A quick
search lead me to an article or two that BT had a NNTP server, of sorts,
provided by a third party. So I did a quick check:</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Yay! This looked good.</p>
<p>After that I fired up <code>slrn</code> and.... problems. It kept asking me to log in,
to provide a user name and password. The only problem was that I'd read in more
than one place that a user name and password weren't needed for BT's server;
all that was required was you be on a BT IP address. Checking the slrn docs
I found <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-manual-6.html#ss6.32"><code>force_authentication</code></a>
but ensuring that was off made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point I removed <code>slrn</code> and gave up.</p>
<p>Later, thinking it might be an issue with just <code>slrn</code> and perhaps it was worth
trying a native NNTP client, I grabbed Unison
(<a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">which is no longer supported</a>
but seems to work fine). I got that set up and ran into the same issue: it
wanted login details.</p>
<p>Finally, after a bit more digging, I stumbled on the reason why I was struggling
to make any of this work: <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51205/?s_cid=con_FURL_giganews">BT had closed support for the server back in
December last year</a>!</p>
<p>A quick search around the web and I stumbled on <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org/">Eternal September</a>.
Given all I was interested in was the good old text groups this looked perfect.
I quickly registered an account, ran up Unison again and plugged in my details
and....</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.19.17.png"></p>
<p>Now that's all sorted I should try again with <code>slrn</code>. At which point I'll need
to drag out and tidy up <code>post.el</code> (<a href="http://post-mode.sourceforge.net/">the version that was being maintained
by some other people seems to have gone very stale</a>, sadly).</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>A little earlier today I decided it was time that I read up a little more about
the abilities of OS X's Spotlight facility. I use it a little -- it's a handy
tool to get at some often-used applications that I don't really need laying
around in the dock -- but I was starting to wonder if I could get more out of
it.</p>
<p>The obvious first place to look was in the HelpViewer; all the information I'm
ever going to need will be on the local machine, right?</p>
<p>So I open the HelpViewer, from the Spotlight bar, and type in that I want
information about Spotlight. The page comes up blank. The page was pretty small
so, while I pondered why it might be blank, I resized it and it disappeared!
I tried to open it again and.... nothing. Nothing I did would make the
HelpViewer show again.</p>
<p>I then tried following the advice
<a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Troubleshooting_Help_Viewer">on this page</a> but
none of that appeared to help. I then looked for the HelpViewer in the
Activity Monitor and killed it with that.</p>
<p>Running it again after that got me back to where I started. I tried the while
process again and, sure enough, trying to resize the window made it disappear.
I can make it happen every single time:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/id9Gb8SDYrg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>So it looks like another fine example of the Apple "it just works" thing.
For "doesn't always just work" values of "just works".</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>As much as I like my iMac, and as much as I am generally impressed with OS X
the more I use it, I'm constantly frustrated by the little issues I run into
that make life so much more interesting and which fly in the face of the
"it just works with Apple" fandom thing. The more I use the iMac, the more I
appreciate that Macs and OS X are just as "fun" as anything running Windows.</p>
<p>A little earlier was a good example. I wanted to share part of the iMac's
filesystem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">SMB</a>.
This seemed easy enough, the instructions on how to do it were clear and,
after following them, it utterly failed.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>So I Googled the issue a bit and ran into
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6629743?start=0&amp;tstart=0">this handy forum post</a>.
Apparently you can't actually connect with SMB if the account you're going to
be using to connect with is using iCloud login rather than a separate login.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Not an obvious thing. Nothing said this was the case. According to the forum
post even Apple couldn't help the person who'd been trying to make it work.
But at least there was a workaround. All I'd need to do is split the password,
have a login for the machine that <em>wasn't</em> the iCloud login and I'd be all good.</p>
<p>I did it, it worked. I could browse the iMac's filesystem from my Windows
machine and all was good (I'd been able to do this the other way around
for ages and with no problems whatsoever).</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to allow SMB for me" src="/attachments/2015/10/21/Screen Shot 2015-10-21 at 15.29.11.png"></p>
<p>Then I got curious.</p>
<p>What would happen if, once I had this set up, I "unsplit" the password and
went back to using the iCloud password to log in? That's when it got really fun.</p>
<p>To do this it asks you for the current password and also your iCloud password.
I entered both and...</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to allow SMB for me" src="/attachments/2015/10/21/Screen Shot 2015-10-21 at 15.28.46.png"></p>
<p>Yup. It refuses, every single time, to accept that the iCloud password I'm
entering is valid. Trust me, it is. I'm entering the correct password. I can
log in to the iCloud website with it just fine. But when I use it to try and
"unsplit" my password.... nope.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've even tried disabling SMB sharing for my account, and even turning off
SMB sharing altogether. This doesn't seem to make any difference. Right now,
as far as I can see, now that I've split the password I can't go back
despite the fact that there's a method of doing it made available.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p></div>

one anyway):</p>

<p>I've never noticed it before. I'm not sure if this came about with
<a href="/2015/10/06/el-capitan.html">the upgrade to El Capitan</a> or not.
But now I've seen it I can't unsee it.</p></div>

      <div><p>Almost a week ago (yes, I have being meaning to write something down about
this and have kept failing to do so) my iMac told me that there was a new
version of the OS waiting for me. While this is doubtless no big deal for
most Mac owners, this was interesting to me because it's the first time
I've experienced an OSX upgrade since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I got the iMac</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="El Capitan downloading" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.01.37.png"></p>
<p>The download took a while and, while the install had a couple of curious
bumps along the way, nothing seemed to actually go wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="About to get going" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.18.png"></p>
<p>The two main things I noticed were that it seemed to take the installer an
absolute age to close down all running apps before it got to doing the
installation. The other was that Mac progress bars seem to have a very odd
way of calculating things. Often it would tell me that there was (for example)
28 minutes to go, it'd stay like that for 20 minutes, then drop 5 minutes,
then appear to finish very soon after.</p>
<p><img alt="The final countdown" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Mostly though I just left it alone and let it do its own thing. While the whole
process took quite a while, it came back just fine (if I'm fair I'm not sure
it took much more time than when I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to
Windows 10).</p>
<p>The changes and improvements aren't really that obvious. I think I would say
that the machine feels a little quicker in places, but nothing I can really
put my finger on. One of the things I do like is the new split-screen facility
for full-screen apps. While I don't use the full-screen facility <em>that</em> much
I have found the need to split the screen before.</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements I've read about seem to involve things I'm
never going to use: either improvements to Safari (Chrome all the way for
me), the Mac Mail app (Gmail all the way for me, with <a href="http://www.kiwiforgmail.com/">Kiwi for Gmail</a>
being my client of choice on the iMac) or various iOS-oriented things which
are of little use (while <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I do own an iOS device</a> it's not one I use much).</p>
<p>Overall the thing I'm taking away from this is that the upgrade was smooth,
nothing was obviously broken or changed in a way that was confusing (unlike
some Windows or ChromeOS updates I've experienced in the past) and I didn't
have to do anything that required much in the way of knowledge to keep it
all going.</p>
<p>Doubtless that won't always be the case, such is the nature of OS upgrades.</p></div>

      <div><p>While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">my iMac</a>.</p>
<p>One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:</p>
<p><img alt="Support details of the iMac" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.14.png"></p>
<p>Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.23.png"></p>
<p>Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o</p>
<p>I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.30.55.png"></p>
<p>About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.</p>
<p>So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Last night, before heading for bed, I noticed that there was an update available
for OS X on the iMac, and also for iTunes. Despite the late hour I decided
to do the update anyway. OS X updated pretty smoothly (albeit with some rather
unhelpful progress bars that appear to give estimated times that have no
relation to reality), as did iTunes.</p>
<p>I was then told that there was an update for my iPod as well (all part of this
new thing where Apple have invented Spotify, obviously). I let that start doing
its thing and that's where things got odd. First it started the update and the
iPod appeared to insist that it wasn't plugged into the iMac, even though it
was. Then I gave it a second go (after unplugging it and plugging it in
again) and it all seemed to go through just fine, only...</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iPod?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Photo 01-07-2015 10 21 56.png"></p>
<p>...while the iPod was pretty sure it was now running iOS 8.4, iTunes on the iMac
had other ideas:</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.22.16.png"></p>
<p>The following morning iTunes kept insisting that it needed to do the update
so, even though the iPod was obviously up to date, I let it do it anyway. After
it'd gone through the update process again it still insisted that the iPod
was running 8.3 rather than 8.4. Until, that is, I unplgged it and plugged it
back in again.</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.26.20.png"></p>
<p>So now it all seems fine. I just had to do a variation on "have you tried
turning it off and on again?"</p>
<p>Once again I find myself running into things on a Mac that are very common
elsewhere, on other operating systems, and which Mac owners would often have
you believe weren't an issue.</p></div>
