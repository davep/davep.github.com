  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview"><code>textual-astare</code></a> is another
Textual-based Python project that I've developed in the last year and I
don't believe I've mentioned on this blog. Simply put, it's a took for
viewing the abstract syntax tree of Python code, in the terminal.</p>
<p><img alt="astare in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/10/astare.png#centre"></p>
<p>I've just made a small update to it this evening after someone asked <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions/12">for a
sensible change I've been meaning to do for a
while</a>. When I
first read the request I <em>was</em> going to look at it next week, when I have
some time off work, but you know how it is when you sit at your desk and
have a "quick look".</p>
<p>So anyway, yeah, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-astview/">v0.8.0</a> is out
there and can be installed, with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a></li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.39.0"><code>textual</code></a></li>
<li>Made it so you can open a directory to browser from the command line.</li>
<li>Made opening the current working directory the default.</li>
<li>Tweaked the way dark/light mode get toggled so that it's now
  command-palette-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the code does need a wee bit of tidying -- this was one of my
earliest apps built with Textual and my approach to writing Textual apps has
changed a fair bit this year, and Textual itself has grown and improved in
that time -- but it's still working well for now.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I don't think I've mentioned it before on this blog, but some time back I
decided it would be fun to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> to
write a Mandelbrot explorer (simple Mandelbrot explorers have been another
one of my favourite <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">known problem to try an unknown
thing</a> problems). Doing it in the
terminal seemed like a fun little hack. I started off with creating
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas"><code>textual-canvas</code></a> and then built
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot"><code>textual-mandelbrot</code></a> on top
of that.</p>
<p>Not too long back <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/15/textual-0370-adds-a-command-palette/">I added a "command palette" to
Textual</a>
(I'd prefer to call it a minibuffer, but I get that that's not fashionable
these days), but so far I've not used it in any of my own projects; earlier
today I thought it could be fun to add it to <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mandelbrot commands in action" src="/attachments/2023/09/29/mandelbrot-commands.png#centre"></p>
<p>Most of the commands I've added are trivial and really better covered by
(and are covered by) keystrokes, but it was a good test and a way to show
off how to create a command provider.</p>
<p>Having started this I can see some more useful things to add: for example it
might be interesting to add a facility where you can bookmark a specific
location, zoom level, iteration value, etc, and revisit later. The command
palette would feel like a great way to pull back those bookmarks.</p>
<p>What I really liked though was how <em>easy</em> this was to do. <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot/blob/main/textual_mandelbrot/commands.py">The code to make
the commands
available</a>
is pretty trivial and, I believe, easy to follow. Although I do say so
myself I think I managed to design a very accessible API for this.</p>
<p>There's more I'd like to add to that (the Textual command palette itself, I
mean), of course; this was just the start. Support for commands that accept
and prompt for arguments would be a neat and obvious enhancement (especially
if done in a way that's reminiscent of how commands could be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager">CLIM</a> -- I
remember <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-cldict/">really liking</a> how you
could create self-documenting and self-completing commands in that).</p>
<p>All in good time...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since <a href="/2023/09/01/textual-query-sandbox.html">quickly hacking together <code>textual-query-sandbox</code> a few days
back</a>, I've made a bunch of small
changes here and there. While most have been cosmetic and playing with some
ideas, some have also been internal improvements that should make the tool
work better.</p>
<p>The most prominent change is one I pondered in the previous post, where I
thought it might be interesting to have a small collection of playgrounds
grounded together with a <code>TabbedContent</code>. So as of now the tool still has
the original playground which had an emphasis on nested containers:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 1" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-1.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's now a playground with an emphasis on selecting widgets within
containers<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 2" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-2.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's also now a playground that has an emphasis on pulling out widgets
based on ID and classes:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 3" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-3.png#centre"></p>
<p>The other change you will notice from the original post is the DOM tree
shown in the bottom right corner. Note that that isn't there to show your
query result (that's the bottom left panel), it's there to help picture how
the DOM in the current playground hangs together, and will hopefully help in
picturing the structure for when you write a query.</p>
<p>I sense there's still a lot of fun things I could add to this, and I'm still
keen on the idea of having the playgrounds "soft coded" in some way, so
people can make their own and load them up.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to try and work on is making the display as useful as
possible. While I think it's actually pretty neat and clear, there's not a
<em>lot</em> of space<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> available to show the playground and the results. Finding
a good balance is an interesting problem.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons this is turning into a really enjoyable tinker
project.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This is, of course, slightly nonsensical wording. Containers <em>are</em>
widgets in Textual. Pretty much everything you see in your terminal is a
widget, even a <code>Screen</code> is a widget.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>A lot of this of course hinges on how big someone's terminal is. I
tend to run a fairly high resolutions with the smallest font I find
readable so my terminal windows are often pretty "big"; other people
tend to have something much smaller in terms of cell with/height.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Sometimes I can have an idea for a Textual widget, library or application on
my ideas list for weeks, months even, before I get around to it -- mostly
just due to not having the clear time to make a run at getting it going --
and then other times an idea can pop into my head and it <em>has</em> to be created
there and then. <strong>Has</strong> to be!</p>
<p>This happened yesterday evening.</p>
<p>While the tool I built is something I'd thought of before (back around
November last year I think) it hadn't even made it to my <em>"list of stuff I
should make"</em> that I keep in Apple Reminders; not sure why really. But then
yesterday evening a question cropped up on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Textual Discord
server</a> that related to the subject and I was
reminded of it.</p>
<p>The subject being: <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/">Textual DOM
queries</a>. I like to think that
DOM queries in Textual are pretty easy to do, and well-explained in the
docs, but it's fair to admit that they need a bit of practice first, just
like any powerful tool. So I was reminded that I'd wanted to write a sandbox
application, that would have a practice DOM inside it, an input field to
type in a query, and a way of displaying the results.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-query-sandbox"><code>textual-query-sandbox</code></a>
was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Query Sandbox" src="/attachments/2023/09/01/tqs.png#centre"></p>
<p>In this very first version (which was <em>really</em> quickly put together -- it
was something like 15 minutes to write the main code and then probably 45
minutes tweaking styles, adding all the admin stuff to allow <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-query-sandbox/">deployment to
PyPi</a> and writing the
README) there's an <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/input/"><code>Input</code></a>,
a display of a group of nested containers with different IDs and classes,
and then a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/pretty/"><code>Pretty</code></a> widget
at the bottom to show the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/#query-objects"><code>query</code></a>
result.</p>
<p>If you think this looks like it might be useful to you, it can be installed
using either <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-query-sandbox
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then you can run it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>tqs
</code></pre></div>

<p>At which point load up the Textual query docs, type queries into the input
field, hit enter and see what gets highlighted and which widgets end up in
the result set at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Like I say: this was a quick hack yesterday evening, I think there's a lot
more can go into this. For one thing I think a more interesting practice DOM
would be a good idea, with a good mix of widgets; another thing could be
having a collection of different DOM playgrounds that can be switched
between (a <code>TabbedContent</code> of different playgrounds could be fun here); this
could even be taken further such that the user can create their own
playground DOM to practice against.</p>
<p>Eventually it would be neat if this could be turned into a library that can
be included in a Textual application, as a development-time debug tool, so
that on-the-fly test queries can be made.</p>
<p>For now though, it's started, it's under way, and I think the current
version probably covers 90% of the use cases for something like this; making
for a really quick and easy tool to double-check how to query something.</p></div>

      <div><p><a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">Late on last year</a> I wrote about a
bunch of new things that I'd added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an
early <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">dog-fooding session we had at textual
HQ</a>.
Since then I've been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to
date with Textual.</p>
<p><img alt="Unbored" src="/attachments/2023/08/13/unbored.png#centre"></p>
<p>As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework,
but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there's still new ways of
doing things being designed so there's going to be the odd break in approach
now and again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/unbored">Unbored</a>, my kind of silly
self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x
for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with
0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple
of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn't crashing.</p>
<p>The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of
containers (they didn't used to receive focus by default, now they do so I
had to tell them not to again), and that was about it.</p>
<p>While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZsXGQQpFw">nifty little slide-in error dialog I'd
made</a>, and instead embraced
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/07/17/textual-0300-adds-desktop-style-notifications/">the new Textual notification
system</a>.</p>
<p>While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no <em>real</em> use to
anyone, I feel it's a pretty good barometer application, helping me check
what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual
application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual
dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested
way; for this though it's less crucial and is a good test of the state of
the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it'll be
helpful to me if it <em>does</em> break and they yell.</p></div>

<p>Given that for a good chunk of this year I've been a bit lax about writing
here, there's a couple or so coding projects I've not written about (well,
not on <em>here</em> anyway -- I have spoken lots about them <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep">over on
Fosstodon</a>). One such project is
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-canvas/"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>.</p>
<p>As the name might suggest, it's a "canvas" for Textual applications, which
provides a pretty basic interface for drawing pixels, lines and circles --
and of course any other shape you are able to build up from those basics.</p>
<p>I've just <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/releases/tag/v0.2.0">released a quick
update</a> after
it was <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/discussions/1">requested that I add a <code>clear</code> method to the <code>Canvas</code>
widget</a>; a request
that makes perfect sense.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Well, it didn't take as long as I expected it to. Just <a href="/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html#considering-pelican">yesterday
morning</a> I was
giving <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> a look over as a possible engine
for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while
now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I
liked it and wondered how long it would take me to make the switch.</p>
<p>By the evening I was making a proper effort to get the switchover started,
and just a wee while earlier, before writing this post, the switch was made!</p>
<p>The process of making the switch was roughly this (and keep in mind I'm
coming from using Jekyll):</p>
<ol>
<li>Made a branch in the repo to work in.</li>
<li>Removed all of the Jekyll-oriented files.</li>
<li>Decided to set up Pelican and related tools in a virtual environment,
   managed using <code>pipenv</code>.</li>
<li>Ran <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick things off and give me a framework to
   start with.</li>
<li>Renamed the old <code>_posts</code> directory to <code>content</code>.</li>
<li>Kept tweaking the hell out of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/blob/main/pelicanconf.py">Pelican config
   file</a>
   until it started to look "just so" (this is a process that has been
   ongoing, and doubtless will keep happening for some time to come).</li>
<li>Tried out a few themes and settled on
   <a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex">Flex</a>; while not <em>exactly</em>
   what I wanted, it was close enough to help keep me motivated (while
   rolling my own theme from scratch would seem fun, I just know it would
   mean the work would never get done, or at least finished).</li>
<li>Did a mass tidy up of all the tags in all the posts; something I'd never
   really paid too much attention to as the Jekyll-based blog never actually
   allowed for following tags.</li>
<li>Went though all the posts and removed double quotes from a lot of the
   titles in the frontmatter (something Jekyll seems to have stripped, but
   which Pelican doesn't).</li>
<li>Tweaked the <code>FILE_METADATA</code> to ensure that the slugs for the URLs came
    from the filenames -- by default Pelican seems to slugify the title of a
    post and this meant that some of the URLs were changing.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all I probably spent 6 or 7 hours on making the move; a lot of that
involving reading up on how to configure Pelican and researching themes. The
rest of it was a lot of repetitive work to fix or tidy things.</p>
<p><em>The</em> most important aspect of this was keeping the post URLs the same all
the way back to the first post; as best as I can tell I've managed that.</p>
<p>So far I'm pleased with the result. I'm going to live with the look/theme
for a wee while and see how it sits for me. I'm sure I'll tweak it a bit as
time goes on, but at the moment I'm comfortable with how it looks.</p></div>

      <div><p>Since getting my blog editing environment set up on the "new" machine <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">a
couple of days back</a> I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog <a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html">back in 2015</a>, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912">mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new</a>, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.</p>
<p>One that looks promising so far is <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).</li>
<li>Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).</li>
<li>Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.</li>
<li>Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web">using the library when kicking
  off <code>ng2web</code></a>).</li>
<li>RSS feed generation.</li>
<li>Syntax-highlighted code blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.</p>
<p>Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.</p>
<p>Things got off to a good start with an easy install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;pelican[markdown]&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then used the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a <em>very</em> rough
version of my blog up and going.</p>
<p>It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.</p>
<p>I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a base theme that's to my taste.</li>
<li>Get Disqus working it so that any old comments remain in place.</li>
<li>Get my image/attachment layout back in place.</li>
<li>Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).</li>
<li>Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.</li>
<li>Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!</p>
<p>Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.
;-)</p>

      <div><p><img alt="My new GitHub banner" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/davep/main/davep.svg"></p>
<p>Ever since GitHub introduced the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme">profile
README</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
I've had a massively low-effort one in place. I made the repo, quickly wrote
the file, and then sort of forgot about it. Well, I didn't so much forget as
just keep looking at it and thinking "I should do something better with that
one day".</p>
<p>Thing is, while there are lots of fancy approaches out there, and lots of
neat generator tools and the like... they just weren't for me.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, over my second morning coffee, after <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">getting my blog
environment up and going again</a>, I had an
idea. It could be cool to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.save_screenshot">Textual's screenshot
facility</a>
to make something terminal-themed! I mean, while it's not <em>all</em> I am these
days, so much of what I'm doing right now is aimed at the terminal.</p>
<p>So... what to do? Then I thought it could be cool to knock up some sort of
login screen type thing; with a banner. One visit to an online large
terminal text generator site later, I had some banner text. All that was
left was to write <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep/blob/main/make_banner.py">a simple Textual application to create the
"screen"</a>.</p>
<p>The main layout is simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">compose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">ComposeResult</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NAME</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">classes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;banner&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PRATTLE</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;github.com/davep login: [reverse] [/]&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>where <code>NAME</code> contains the banner and <code>PRATTLE</code> contains the "login message".
With some <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/CSS/">Textual CSS</a> sprinkled
over it to give the exact layout and colour I wanted, all that was left was
to make the snapshot. This was easy enough too.</p>
<p>While the whole thing isn't fully documented just yet, Textual does have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.run_test">a
great tool for automatically running an application and interacting with
it</a>; that
meant I could easily write a function to load up my app and save the
screenshot:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_banner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">GitHubBannerApp</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run_test</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pilot</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">pilot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save_screenshot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;davep.svg&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, that needs running async, but that's simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">make_banner</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Throw in a <code>Makefile</code> so I don't forget what I'm supposed to run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nl">.PHONY:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">all</span>
<span class="nl">all:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">pipenv</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">run</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">python</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">make_banner.py</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and that's it! Job done!</p>
<p>From here onward I guess I could have some real fun with this. It would be
simple enough I guess to modify the code so that it changes what's displayed
over time; perhaps show a "last login" value that relates to recently
activity or something; any number of things; and then run it in a cron job
and update the repository.</p>
<p>For now though... I'll stick with keeping things nice and simple.</p>

      <div><p>Another little thing that's up on PyPi now, which is the final bit of
fallout from <a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">the Textual dogfooding
sessions</a>, is a little project I'm
calling OIDIA.</p>
<p>The application is a streak tracker. I'm quite the fan of streak trackers.
I've used a few over the years, both to help keep me motivated and honest,
and also to help me track that I've avoided unhelpful things too. Now, most
of the apps I've used, and use now, tend to have reminders and counts and
stats and are all about "DO NOT BREAK THE STREAK OR ELSE" and that's mostly
fine, but...</p>
<p>To keep things simple and to purely concentrate on how to build Textual
apps, I made this a "non-judgement" streak tracker. It's designed to be
really simple: you add a streak, you bump up/down the number of times you
did (or didn't do) the thing related to that streak, for each day, and
that's it.</p>
<p>No totals. No stats. No reminders and bugging. No judgement.</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kz8eUzO9-8"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>When I started it, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to store the data.
Throwing it in a SQLite database held some appeal, but that also felt like a
lot of faff for something so simple. Also, I wanted to make the data as easy
to get at, to use elsewhere, and to hack on, as possible. So in the end I
went with a simple JSON file.</p>
<p>On macOS and GNU/Linux <code>streaks.json</code> lives in <code>~/.local/share/oidia</code>, on
Windows it'll be in... I'm not sure off the top of my head actually; it'll
be in whatever directory <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xdg/">the handy <code>xdg</code>
library</a> has chosen. and because it's JSON
that means that something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="OIDIA in action" src="/attachments/2022/12/16/oidia.png"></p>
<p>ends up looking like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how well that actually scales; possibly not
so well over a long period of time, but this was written more as another way
to explore Textual than anything else. Even then, it would be pretty trivial
to update to something better for holding the data.</p>
<p>If this seems like your thing (and I will be supporting it and onward
developing it) you <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oidia/">can find it over on
PyPi</a>, which means it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or the ever-handy <code>pipx</code>:</p>
