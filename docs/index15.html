  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday evening I finally got the following notification on my Moto360:</p>
<p><img alt="Moto360 Update Notification" src="/attachments/2015/06/20/Moto360Update.png"></p>
<p>Given the charge was quite a way below that I took the watch off and put it
on charge and then did the update later.</p>
<p>From what I could tell it all went pretty smooth. After updating it even
offered me a little tutorial on some of the new things it's added. So far
I've used (or set up) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The much better "launcher"
  Finding and running apps on the watch was always a bit of a pain, so much so
  that others had even written special launchers for Android Wear. This seems
  to be pretty much solved now. Pressing and holding the watch's side button
  will pop up application list, from here you can swipe right to your
  contacts (them letting you send messages, start calls, etc) and right again
  for the usual list of actions that you used to go straight into.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way it's done now makes a lot more sense and seems far cleaner.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi
  I've yet to notice the benefit of this, but I've not paid too much attention
  yet either. The watch now does WiFi. This is supposed to mean that it can
  still work with my phone when it's out of Bluetooth range. I say I don't know
  if it's working yet because I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.derfreimann.wear.widgets.miniconnectionnotifier&amp;hl=en_GB">an app to tell me if my phone is out of
  range</a>
  and it still keeps tripping as normal -- but I'm unsure if that means
  it's simply telling me it's out of BT range but really the watch is now
  doing its thing over WiFi, or perhaps the phone connection really has been
  lost despite me having set up the WiFi connection. More testing needs to
  happen here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting this up was curious: I had to turn it on on the watch and then
  select the access points I wanted to work with, again on the watch. But to
  actually connect I had to switch back to my phone to enter the AP passwords
  (which makes perfect sense of course, nobody wants to type passwords into
  a watch face).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gestures
  These needed to be turned on in settings. I've being using them this morning
  to navigate cards on the watch and it's really well done and really natural.
  Simply put, you flick your wrist up, or down, to "flick" from one card to
  another. All it seems to be missing is some method of gesturing that I want
  to swipe a card out of the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than the above it's pretty much business as usual. Hopefully there's
been some work to improve battery life and all that sort of stuff, and only
time will tell if a difference has been made there.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've no idea when this happened, and I'll admit that the advice it gives is
advice I've mostly being following anyway for quite a long time, but it seems
that ssh in the ChromeOS terminal has been removed. This is what just happened
when I tried to use it just now:</p>
<p><img alt="ChromeOS ssh no longer working" src="/attachments/2015/06/19/Screenshot 2015-06-19 at 09.03.58.png"></p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">Chrome Secure Shell</a>
is pretty damn good and has served me well for the past couple or so years,
working well on the Chromebook and on Windows 7 and 8 (and also now on the Mac,
although I'm tending to use ssh in its native terminal more).</p>
<p>I wonder if any other of the limited features of the ChromeOS terminal (in
non-dev mode anyway) are going to go the same way?</p>
<hr>
<p>As an aside to the above, something kind of ironic happened as I was writing
this. I opened Chrome so I could preview the post as I was writing it and
I suffered one of Chrome's rather common extension crashes. Look what one of
those extensions was (and I wasn't even using it at the time):</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome ssh extension crashes for no reason" src="/attachments/2015/06/19/Screen Shot 2015-06-19 at 09.12.34.png"></p>
<p>Not exactly the best advert for the non-optional replacement.</p></div>

      <div><p>For a long time now Chrome has been my web browser of choice. It has, to some
degree, become my "other emacs" (ignoring for a moment that my use of GNU
emacs has sort of lapsed the last few years). By that I mean that it's a
portable environment that serves me well on many operating systems and, for
one of my machines, actually <em>is</em> the operating system. I really appreciate how
Chrome's sync lets me feel right at home no matter which machine I'm on.</p>
<p>But I've run into one small issue that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>In some situations I find it pleasing, and I find it makes sense, that some
web "apps" open in a window of their own rather than in a Chrome tab. On Windows
and on ChromeOS this is simple enough, all I need to do is find the "app" in
the Chrome app launcher, pull up the content menu, and tell it to open as a
window.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on Windows 7" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextWin.png"></p>
<p>Nice and simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac, so well known for doing everything every other OS does but doing
it better and being easier to use.... you'd expect it's at least the same there,
right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on OS X" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextMac.png"></p>
<p>There's no option at all to open as a window!</p>
<p>So, on the Mac, while I'd love to be able to open Gmail as a window/app in its
own right, I'm totally out of luck, it seems. I've no idea whose "fault" this
is. It's not clear to me if this is a Chrome/Google decision or if it's about
how things have to work on a Mac. Thing is, I find it hard to believe that
it's the latter given that Google Keep runs in its own window on the Mac and
I can happily pin it to the dock.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It's that simple on ChromeOS too. In case you're wondering why I
didn't also illustrate that, it's because you can't take a screenshot on
ChromeOS while you've got a context menu open. O_o&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <div><p>Hello, world.</p>
<p>So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set
of posts on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts">Google+</a> or a torrent
of 140-character thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">twitter</a> but
an actual blog.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects
I want to have a go at over the next few months and writing about them as I
work on them might be fun. Another reason is that I've being wanting to explore
the business of hosting a blog on GitHub pages for quite some time and now's
the perfect time to do it.</p>
<p>So how am I doing this? Well, for starters, I recently acquired an iMac. The
reasons for how and why I chose to do this are varied and mostly uninteresting
but what it does mean is that, for the first time in quite a long time, I
have a Unix desktop machine again. This fact alone means it's nice and easy
for me to play with the likes of Git (or, at the moment more
<a href="https://mac.github.com/">GitHub for Mac</a> than the command line git), ruby,
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> (along with
<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll">a rather nifty package for quickly kicking off a blog post</a>).
So that's how I'm doing it. Writing it all locally and pushing it up to
GitHub and hosting it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>As this goes on I imagine much will change. I've started out with a basic
setup, created by simply using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>davep@Ariel:~/blogging$<span class="w"> </span>jekyll<span class="w"> </span>new<span class="w"> </span>davep.github.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>From now on I'll be playing with styles and my own layouts to see what I can
come up with and what I like (although, I most say, for the most part I'm
actually liking the clean look it delivers out of the box).</p>
<p>One thing that's obviously missing right now is a facility for commenting.
That's something I'll look into should I feel it's necessary -- from what I've
seen elsewhere it's easy enough to make use of something like
<a href="https://disqus.com/">disqus</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>One other thing I might look at doing is putting this behind my own domain.
For the moment it's only available via github.io and I guess it might look
nicer if it was actually available via a URL that looks like the name I've
attached to the blog. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's it for now. Time to push this up and think some more about
where it'll go from here.</p></div>
