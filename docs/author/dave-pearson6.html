    <p>
      Posted on 2019-10-26 13:19 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/python.html">Python</a>

        &#8226; 3 min read
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Something I always try to do when I'm coding is be consistent. I feel this
is important. While people's coding standards may differ, I think different
approaches are easier to handle if someone has been consistent with their
style across all of their code.</p>
<p>This also stands for documentation too.</p>
<p>In my current position, I do a <em>lot</em> of Python coding, and one of the things
I like about Python (there are things I don't like too, but that's not for
now) is that it has doc-strings (just like my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">favourite
language</a>). I use them
extensively, ensuring every function and method has some form of
documentation, and generally I use
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> to generate documentation
from those doc-strings.</p>
<p>Early on I was bothered by the fact that, just by the simple act of making
typos, I wasn't keeping the form of the doc-strings consistent. And in this
case it was a <em>really</em> simple thing that was bugging me. Normally, if I'm
writing a single-line doc-string, I'll write like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">one_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is a one-line doc-string.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far, so good. But, if the doc-string is a multi-liner, I prefer the
ending quotes to be on a line of their own, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But, sometimes, by accident, I'd leave a doc-string like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While it's really not a big deal, it would bug me and every time I found one
like this I'd "fix" it.</p>
<p>Eventually, it bugged me enough that I decided I was going to write a little
tool to find all such instances in my code and report them. My first
approach was to think "I could just do this with some regexp magic", <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">which
was really a bad idea</a>. Then I
though, I know, I should use this as an excuse to to play with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">Python's ast
library</a>.</p>
<p>That worked really well! I had <a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck/blob/dc5052002690b1f898ccd68f815cdedbe9172b74/pydscheck">the first version of the
code</a>
up and running in no time. It was simple but did the job. It ran through
Python code I threw at it and alerted me to both missing doc-strings, and
doc-strings with the ending I didn't like.</p>
<p>That served me for a while, until one day I realised that it wasn't quite
doing the job correctly; it was only really looking at top-level functions
and top-level methods in classes. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, I'll
define functions within functions, and I feel they deserve documentation
too. So then I modified the code to ensure it walked every part of the AST.</p>
<p>Since then, when I've run into new things and had new ideas, <code>pydscheck</code> has
grown and grown. I've added checks that all mentioned parameters have a
type; I've added checks that any function/method that returns something
actually documents the return value; I've added checks that any
documentation of a returned value includes its type; I've added checks that
any function or method that yields a value documents that fact; I've added
checks that ensure that every parameter is documented in some way.</p>
<p>Each time I've done this it's helped uncover issues in my code's
documentation that could be cleaner, and it's also given me a pet project to
slowly better understand Python's AST.</p>
<p>It could be that there are better tools out there, I'd have thought that a
good doc-string linting tool would be something someone had already written.
But this time around I was happy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> it because I needed a
fun learning exercise that would also have some benefits for my day-to-day
work.</p>
<p>I'll caveat this with the fact that it's very particular to how I work and
how I like my documentation to look, but if it sounds useful, here it is:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck">https://github.com/davep/pydscheck</a>.</p>
<p>There's still lots I could do with it. First off I should really properly
package it up so it can be installed as a command line tool via pip. Other
things that would be handy would be to allow some form of customisation of
how it works. I'm sure there's other fun things I can do with it too.</p>
<p>That's part of the fun of having a pet project: you can tinker when you like
and also get benefits from it as you use it.</p></div>

      <div><p><em>I'm filing this as a TIL because, while it wasn't T, I did L it very
recently and it was a new trick that impacted on around 25 years if prior
working practice.</em></p>
<p>I think it must have been around 1991 when I first encountered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS">4DOS</a>. While I'd used the odd Unix
shell here and there previously, it'd only been in passing. It was 4DOS that
first introduced me to the power of aliases on the command line. Many of the
aliases I set up and used in 4DOS still remain with me to this day, on
GNU/Linux and macOS, in some form or another.</p>
<p>I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone reading this why aliases and cool and
handy and pretty much vital if you do lots of work on the command line.</p>
<p>And then, a couple or so weeks ago, as a very recent convert to
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>, I discovered the
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#abbr"><code>abbr</code></a> command. At
first glance it didn't seem to make much sense. It was like
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#alias"><code>alias</code></a>, only it
expanded what you typed rather than acted as a command in its own right.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging and some of it started to make sense. One thing that
really won me over -- and while it's something that doesn't directly impact
on me -- was the argument that it allows for a far more transparent command
history; especially if you're likely to use a transcript of a shell session
in a place where people might not know or have access to your aliases.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a position where you have loads of handy and cool aliases,
but you also need to record what you've done so other people can follow your
work (does it show that I sit amongst people who maintain lab notebooks?);
it seems like it would be a bit of a bother needing to record all of the
aliases in your own work environment up front. Without that information few
people will be able to make sense of the recorded commands, with that
information they'd still need to double-check what each command does.</p>
<p>So imagine an alias that, when used, expands in place. Then you'd get all of
the benefit of aliases while also having a full and readable record of what
you <em>actually</em> did.</p>
<p>Seems neat!</p>
<p>Here's a silly example. For a long time I've carried around an alias called
<code>greedy</code> that runs something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's pretty straightforward: I'm using <code>du</code> to get a sense of which
directories are using what space, and then using <code>sort</code> to make a
worst-to-best-offender list out of it. So I could use an alias:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">greedy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;du -hs * | sort -rh&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The only downside to this is that, any time I run it, if I were to record
the shell session and make it available for someone else to read, they'd
just see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>greedy
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, with an abbreviation rather than an alias, I'd type <code>greedy</code> but as
soon as I hit <code>Enter</code> it'd get expanded to something anyone could read and
follow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is far from the only benefit of abbreviations; for most people it
probably isn't one of the most important ones, but I find it neat and
compelling and this alone drove me to rework almost all of my aliases as
abbreviations.</p>
<p>Having done that, I get other benefits too. For example, fish (like other
shells) has good support for argument completion for well-known commands.
The problem is, if you alias such a command, you don't get that completion.
With an abbreviation though you do! All you need to do is type the
abbreviation, hit <code>space</code> and it'll expand to the underlying command and
then the full range of completion can happen.</p>
<p>There's also one last reason why I like abbreviations over aliases, and it's
kind of a silly one, but in a good way. It's actually fun to see what you
type magically expand as you do things, it makes you look like you can type
even faster than you normally can! ;-)</p>
<p>PS: If you've never tried <code>fish</code> before and you're curious, it's easy to
<a href="https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/">try in your browser</a>.</p></div>

    <p>
      Posted on 2019-10-21 10:41 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/emacs.html">Emacs</a>

          &#8226; Tagged with
              <a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/emacs.html">Emacs</a>,              <a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/git.html">git</a>

  <div>
      <div><p><code>gh.fish</code>, which <a href="/2019/10/20/fg-fish.html">I wrote about yesterday</a>,
actually sprang from something I initially wrote for Emacs. I'm often
spending my time switching between Emacs and the command line (which is fast
and easy -- I normally work on macOS and have Emacs and
<a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> running full screen, and I can switch
between them without ever taking my hands off the keyboard), so it makes
sense to have some handy commands repeated in both places.</p>
<p>So, originally, I'd written
<a href="https://github.com/davep/gitweb.el"><code>gitweb.el</code></a> to open the current repo's
"forge" in the web browser.</p>
<p>As with the fish version, how it works is quite simple. I use
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Synchronous-Processes.html"><code>shell-command-to-string</code></a>
to call git and find the origin URL for the current repo, and then
manipulate it a bit to turn it into a normal browser-friendly URL. Finally,
if I get something workable, I use
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Browse_002dURL.html"><code>browser-url</code></a>
to have the resulting page open in the browsing environment of choice.</p>
<p>I have the command <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/8f1be3a03e4be98155571939fe5d6fbb54de487f/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L51-L54">bound to a key combination that's similar to the ones I
use with magit and
forge</a>,
so in terms of muscle-memory it's easy for me to remember what to press when
I quickly want to skip over from a magit view to the repo forge itself.</p>
<p>Similar to what I wrote <a href="/2019/10/19/pypath-el.html">a couple of days back</a>,
I think this again illustrates how handy Emacs is as a work environment.
While it's absolutely true that there are other development environments out
there that offer similar extensibility, Emacs is the one I'm comfortable
with, and it has a <em>long</em> history of offering this.</p></div>

      <div><p>These days <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> is my shell of choice. I started
out with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> back in the 1990s, went
through a bit of a
<a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>/<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> phase, but
earlier this year finally settled on fish.</p>
<p>At some point I might write a post about my fish config, and why fish works
well for me. But that's an idea for another time.</p>
<p>In this post I thought I'd share a little snippet of code that can come in
handy now and again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find myself inside a git repo, in the shell, and I want to get
to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29">forge</a>" for
that repo. This is most often either on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, or in
a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/">company-local installation of GitLab</a>.
To get there quickly I wrote
<a href="https://gist.github.com/davep/3bac3b30e45a3560c265150e609219db"><code>gh.fish</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">##############################################################################</span>

<span class="n">end</span>

<span class="cp">### gh.fish ends here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea is pretty simple: I see if the repo has an origin of some
description and, if it has, I <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#string">slice and dice
it</a> into something
that looks like the URL you'd expect to find for a GitHub or GitLab repo.
Finally I use
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#open"><code>open</code></a> to open the
URL in the environment's browser of choice.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>One of the things I really like about coding with Emacs is how I can easily
identify a repeated task and turn it into a command in my environment,
saving me a load of work down the line.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el"><code>pypath.el</code></a> is one such example.</p>
<p>In my day job I write a lot of Django code. As part of that, I write a good
number of unit tests too. Sometimes I'll write the tests as I'm writing the
code they test, other times I'm writing them afterwards; it all really
depends on where my head's at and how the code is flowing.</p>
<p>When I'm writing those tests, I often want to test them as I go. Given that
starting up a test session can take a while, and given that running all the
tests in the system can take a while, it's really handy if I can run that
single test I'm working on.</p>
<p>This is easy enough with Django. In my work environment it's normally
something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>./manage.py<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">test</span><span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span>app.test.some.sub.module.TestClass.test_method
</code></pre></div>

<p>Only... typing out the:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">some</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test_method</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>part is a bit of a pain. Sure, once you've typed it the once you can use
your shell of choice (mine being <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> and on
occasion
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">eshell</a>)
to recall it from history, but typing it out the first time is the annoying
part.</p>
<p>So this was the point where I took 1/2 hour or so to code up
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el"><code>pypath.el</code></a> to solve the problem for
me. It gives me two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pypath</code>: which simply places the dotted path of the <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/python-info-current-defun.html">current
  "defun"</a>,
  within the context of being part of a Django system, into the clipboard
  buffer.</li>
<li><code>pypath-django-test</code>: which works similar to the above but places the
  whole Django testing command into the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above, I can work on a test, hit the latter command above, flip to
my command line, paste and I'm running the test.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm sure there's plenty of other handy ways to do this. Doubtless
there's work environments where the test can be run right there, in the edit
buffer, without flipping away, and which takes into account the fact that
there's a pipenv-managed virtual environment involved, etc. If there is,
that's great, but I don't think it'd work with how I work.</p>
<p>And that's one of the things I really love about Emacs, and why it's still
my work environment after almost 25 years of on and off use: with very
little work on my part I can create a couple of commands that work exactly
how I need them to. While it's great to create <a href="https://melpa.org/">generally-useful code for
Emacs that lots of people benefit from</a>, sometimes the
real value is that <a href="https://blog.davep.org/delpa/">you can code up your own particular quirk and just get
on with stuff</a>.</p>
<p>To conclude: this post isn't to show off <code>pypath.el</code>; really this post is to
sing the praises of Emacs and why it still works so well for me after all
these years.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's well over a year since I last wrote something on this blog. As
mentioned in the last post (and the one before), it's not for bad reasons or
anything like that. Being in a new job, which actually isn't all that new
now, has kept me busy in all the best ways possible.</p>
<p>There's been other stuff going on too which has drawn on my attention and
the time and motivation to blog, either random stuff, or more
development-related stuff, just hasn't been there.</p>
<p>Also... blogging via GitHub, using Jekyll, has lost a lot of its shine. It
sort of makes sense, well, sort of <em>made</em> sense, but in the end it felt like
more work than it should. Whereas most blogging systems tend to encourage
just diving in and banging on the keyboard, there's just a bit more faff
with the GitHub pages approach.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, and with no desire right now to roll my own (which
would be fun, it has to be said), I'm going to <a href="https://blog.davep.dev/">skip off over to Hashnode's
blogging system</a>. It seems to have everything I'd
want and I can slap it on a domain of mine.</p>
<p>Most of my random musings about random things really happen on Twitter, so I
can't imagine I'll be wanting to blog about normal/mundane things. What I
would like to do is write about development-related things from time to
time. So that would seem to fit even better.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of all this waffle. If you land here and it looks kind of
quiet, that's because it has been quiet for a while and I'm now going to try
and concentrate elsewhere, with a wish to do some coding-related writing now
and again.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's been very quiet on the blogging front, I'm afraid, mostly for <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">the
reasons I wrote about back in December last
year</a>. In that time I've been really
very busy with work (in a good way, in a <em>very</em> good way) and there's not a
whole lot of time to be toying with pet projects at home.</p>
<p>However, finding myself with a spare hour or so, I wanted to write about
something I did run into as part of some development at work, and which I
thought might be worth writing about in case it helps someone else.</p>
<p>Recently I've needed to write a library of code for loading data from Excel
Workbooks. Given that the vast majority of coding I do at the moment is in
Python, it made sense to make use of
<a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/">openpyxl</a>. The initial prototype code I
wrote worked well and it soon grew into a full-blown library that'll be used
in a couple of work-related projects.</p>
<p>But one thing kept niggling me... It just wasn't as fast as I'd expected.
The workbooks I'm pulling data from aren't that large, and yet it was taking
a noticeable number of seconds to read in the data, and when I let the code
have a go at a directory full of such workbooks... even the fan on the
machine would ramp up.</p>
<p>It didn't seem right.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of profiling and could see that the code was spending
most of its time deep in the guts of some XML-parsing functions. While I
know that an <code>xlsx</code> file is pretty much an XML document, it seemed odd to me
that it would take so much time and effort to pull the data out from it.</p>
<p>Given that I had other code to be writing, and given that the
workbook-parsing code was "good enough" for the moment, I moved on for a
short while.</p>
<p>But, a couple of weeks back, I had a bit of spare time and decided to
revisit it. I did some more searching on openpyxl and speed issues and
almost everything I found said that the common problem was failing to open
the workbook in <code>read_only</code> mode. That can't have been my problem because
I'd being doing that from the very start.</p>
<p>Eventually I came across a post somewhere (sorry, I've lost it for now --
I'll try and track it down again) that suggested that openpyxl was very slow
to read from a workbook if you were reading one cell at a time, rather than
using generators. The suggestion being that every time you pull a value form
a cell, it has to parse the whole sheet up to that cell. Generators, on the
other hand, would allow access to all the cells during one parse.</p>
<p>This seemed a little unlikely to me -- I'd have expected the code to cache
the parsing results or something like that -- but it also would explain what
I was seeing. So I decided to give it a test.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/openpyxl-speed-issue"><code>openpyxl-speed-issue</code></a> is a
version of the tests I wrote and ran and they absolutely show that there's a
huge difference between cell-by-cell access vs generator access.</p>
<p>Code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_row</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_column</span> <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="p">][</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is <em>far slower</em> than something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">wb</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test Sheet&quot;</span> <span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">cell</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here's an example of the difference in time, as seen on my iMac:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>make<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">test</span>
pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="w"> </span>./read-using-generators
<span class="w">        </span><span class="m">1</span>.59<span class="w"> </span>real<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.44<span class="w"> </span>user<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.04<span class="w"> </span>sys
pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="w"> </span>./read-using-peeking
<span class="w">       </span><span class="m">25</span>.02<span class="w"> </span>real<span class="w">        </span><span class="m">24</span>.88<span class="w"> </span>user<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.10<span class="w"> </span>sys
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the cell-by-cell approach is about 16 times slower than the
generator approach.</p>
<p>In most circumstances the generator approach would make most sense anyway,
and in any other situation I probably would have used it and never have
noticed this. However, the nature of the workbooks I need to pull data from
means I need to "peek ahead" to make decisions about what I'm doing, so a
more traditional loop over, with an index, made more sense.</p>
<p>I can easily "fix" this by using the generator approach to build up a
two-dimensional array of cells, acquired via the generator; so I can still
do what I want <em>and</em> benefit from using generators.</p>
<p>In conclusion: given that I found it difficult to find information about my
speed issue, and given that the one off-hand comment I saw that suggested it
was this wasn't exactly easy to find, I thought I'd write it all down too
and <a href="https://github.com/davep/openpyxl-speed-issue">create a repository of some test code to illustrate the
issue</a>. Hopefully someone
else will benefit from this in the future.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Today is a fairly significant day for me. For the past 21 (and a bit) years
I've worked for the same company. I know that, for lots of people in my
industry, that's a hell of a long time to be in one position. It was a setup
that served me pretty well; the company was small (I'm not much of a big
company person), I generally got to dictate the development tools and
direction, and I also got to work from home.</p>
<p>The working from home part was especially helpful as other life events
involved me and happened around me. The job I've been in has seen a marriage
come and go, and a move from Hampshire to Lincolnshire, and then from
Lincolnshire to Midlothian. There's been a few adventures along the way.</p>
<p>But, three months ago, I got a call to say that I was to be made redundant.
This sucked, obviously. It also appeared pretty stupid on the part of my
employer: a company that is based around software had decided it no longer
wanted an in-house software developer. A bold, and I think unwise, choice.
From this point on they've decided to only go with contract developers and
<em>only</em> contract developers from overseas (or so the story goes).</p>
<p>As it goes, things have turned out okay. Today is my last day with my old
employer and, as I'm sat here typing this out while having some lunch, I'm
actually glad that it's coming to a close and that I can get to move on.</p>
<p>I have a new employer, and will be starting in my new position during the
first week of January. It'll be very different. It'll all be different. Not
only will I be back working in an office (one where jeans and t-shirts are
the norm, thankfully!), I'm also going to be working in an industry (as a
developer still, of course) that I have no background in and no real
knowledge of. It's going to be a seriously exciting challenge.</p>
<p><img alt="New book" src="/attachments/2017/12/12/IMG_20171212_140656-01.jpeg"></p>
<p>Over the next couple of weeks I've got a fair amount of background reading
(and video watching) to be doing. This isn't so much that I can get on with
the job of development (although there will be a good bit of that to do too
-- who doesn't want to be trying to understand new options for
development?), it's more about understanding the language of the industry
I'll be in and so that I can understand the needs of my users.</p>
<p>Goodbye fashion retail and all related things. Hello genetics and... well, I
don't know, I'm going to find out. :)</p></div>

      <div><p>I've been pretty quiet on here since I last wrote about how I'd done a
further revamp of my Emacs config, so I thought that subject would be a good
reason to write another blog post.</p>
<p>It'll be a mostly short one, and one to muse over something that's been
bugging me for a while now: my decision to lean heavily on <code>customize</code> to
set all sorts of settings.</p>
<p>Initially,
<a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">when I nuked my original config over a year ago</a>,
it seemed to make a lot of sense. Let all the tweaks and set values "hide"
in a file of their own and try and keep the hand-edited config files as
small and as clean as possible. Recently though I've got to thinking that
this obscures too much, hides too much detail, and removes the ability to
actually document what I'm doing and why. It also does make it tricky to
adapt some settings to different platforms or even environments on a single
platform.</p>
<p>Another problem I've run into is
this:
<a href="/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html">when I made the second round of changes</a> and
decided to lean heavily
on <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package"><code>use-package</code></a>, I soon ran into
the minor issue of some packages not making sense, or even being needed, on
some platforms (stuff that's useful on my macOS machines isn't always useful
on my Windows machines, that sort of thing). While <code>use-package</code> can handle
this easily thanks to the <code>:if</code> keyword, I'm still left with the fact that
<code>package-selected-packages</code> still gets populated.</p>
<p>Having <code>package-selected-packages</code> contain a list of installed packages
likely makes sense if you're using just the Emacs package system and you're
not doing the installing with <code>use-package</code> and <code>:ensure</code>. But with
<code>use-package</code> and <code>:ensure</code> I feel like I've got far more control over
things and can adapt what gets installed when depending on which Emacs I'm
running where.</p>
<p>But, because I'm syncing my <code>~/.emacs.d/.custom.el</code> to all my machines too, any
<code>use-package</code> that has a <code>:if</code> to not bother using a package has little
effect because the package still ends up being listed/loaded/seen as part of
the installation.</p>
<p>Ideally, I think, I'd like to be able to have <code>package-selected-packages</code>
held in its own file, or I'd only ever use <code>~/.emacs.d/.custom.el</code> for local
stuff (and so stop syncing it).</p>
<p>Starting today I'm going about a process of moving as much as I can out of
<code>~/.emacs.d/.custom.el</code> and into hand-edited files. In some respects I guess
I am going back to how I used to manage Emacs configuration, but this time
it's not a massive monolithic file-of-Lisp, it's neatly broken down into
sensible sections and it's also biased towards a "grab and config this
package" approach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've not seen any good discussions online about <code>customize</code> vs
"hand-edit", which strikes me as a little odd as it feels like the perfect
"religious issue" for people to have endless disagreements over. I guess,
over the next couple or so weeks, I'll find out if switching back was a good
idea.</p></div>

      <div><p>Just under a year ago I decided to
<a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">totally rewrite my GNU emacs config</a>.
As I wrote at the time, it'd been following me around all sorts of machines
since the early 1990s, starting life on an OS/2 Warp machine and travelling
via MS-DOS, GNU/Linux, Windows and, these days, macOS.</p>
<p>The changes I made last year have served me really well, but there were two
related issues with it that bothered me a little: the fact that I was
maintaining a local library of elisp code in the repository and, worse
still, I was storing the packages I'd installed from elpa and melpa in the
repository as well.</p>
<p>While this did mean it was pretty easy for me to start up a new installation
of emacs on a machine -- all I had to do was clone the repo and run up emacs
-- I wasn't happy with the duplication involved. I didn't like holding code
in my <code>.emacs.d</code> repo that was already held in package archives.</p>
<p>The solution I saw was in two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get some of my code, that might be useful to others, into melpa.</li>
<li>Somehow sort my own package archive for my personal code.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>Over the past week or so I've worked on this approach. It initially started
with me tackling item 1 above: I tidied up and
submitted
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obfusurl.el"><code>obfusurl.el</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/protocols.el"><code>protocols.el</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/services.el"><code>services.el</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/thinks.el"><code>thinks.el</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/uptimes.el"><code>uptimes.el</code></a>. This was a really
helpful process in that it allowed me to brush up on my elisp and emacs
knowledge. It's a good 15+ years since I last wrote any significant elisp
code and things have moved on a little in that time.</p>
<p>Having done that I'd managed to move a handful of my own packages out of my
local library of code, and so out of my <code>.emacs.d</code> repo, but it left me with
the problem of what to do with the rest of it.</p>
<p>That's when I discovered <code>package-x</code> and:</p>

<span class="err">`</span><span class="o">----</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(plus <code>package-upload-file</code> too, of course). This meant I could, in effect,
start my own personal package archive and look at tackling issue 2 above.</p>
<p>This did give me one small problem though: how and where would I host the
archive? I did consider hosting it on a DigitalOcean droplet, but that felt
a little like overkill for something so simple. And then I
realised: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>! All I needed to do was
keep the package archive in its own repo (which I would have done anyway)
and then make the whole repo the source for a GitHub Pages site. A quick
test later and... it worked!</p>
<p>So, by this point, I'd farmed some of my code off to melpa, and now had the
rest of it in "delpa" (which I'd called my personal archive). I could now
use the emacs package management system to install third party packages and
also my own.</p>
<p>But I was still left with one issue: I was still holding the installed
packages inside my <code>.emacs.d</code> repo by way of ensuring that all machines were
in sync in terms of what was installed. Now I needed to work out how to
solve that.</p>
<p>Around this time, as luck would have
it, <a href="https://github.com/tarsius">@tarsius</a>
had
<a href="https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/pull/1#issuecomment-288462491">suggested I look at</a> a
package called <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package"><code>use-package</code></a>
by <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley">@jwiegley</a>. This was the bit I was missing.</p>
<p>With <code>use-package</code> I would be able to declare which packages I needed, how
they'd be installed and, most important of all, it could be set to handle
the fact that the package wasn't even installed. If a package is requested
and there is no local install <code>use-package</code> is smart enough to get the emacs
package system to install it.</p>
<p>So, given that, all I need to do was <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/1fa67c2895f345098057654f6acb3b57a77f1194/startup/davep-packages.el">create a startup file that would
declare the packages I use</a> and
I'd have a setup that should, once I'd cloned <code>.emacs.d</code>, self-install.</p>
<p>Except... yeah, one more issue. <code>use-package</code> isn't part of GNU emacs yet so
I'd need a method of getting it to auto-install so it could then handle
everything else. As it was that was as easy as adding this to the start of
my <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el"><code>init.el</code></a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</span>
<span class="c1">;; Make sure the package system is up and running early on.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">require</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;package-archives</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;melpa&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;package-archives</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;delpa&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;http://blog.davep.org/delpa/&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-initialize</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</span>
<span class="c1">;; Bootstrap `use-package&#39;</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">unless</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-installed-p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;use-package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-refresh-contents</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-install</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;use-package</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that in place I was able to nuke all my config on a machine, clone a
fresh copy of <code>.emacs.d</code> (having now ceased tracking and storing the
installed packages in that repo), run up emacs, wait a few moments and then
find that everything was installed and ready to use.</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d"><code>.emacs.d</code></a> is now a lot smaller than
it was before and, I think, even easier to maintain. Right now I think I'm
very close to the ideal emacs config that I wanted to create when I did the
complete rewrite a year ago.</p></div>
