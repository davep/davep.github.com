      <div><p>While I'm still <a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">in blog-tinkering
mode</a> (long may it last!), I
thought it might be handy to keep a page kicking around that has links to
the small collection of "dot file" repositories I have.</p>
<p>Like many people, I keep these in a central location (in my case <a href="https://github.com/davep">up on
GitHub</a>) so that I can very quickly spin up a
familiar work environment on a new machine (new machines are something that
doesn't happen <em>too</em> often, but it's always good to be able to get going
quickly when it does).</p>
<p>So, depending on browser type/size, either above here or off to the side,
there should now be a permanent link to <a href="/pages/dot-files.html">a page of links to those
repositories</a>.</p>
<p>As I look at it now it's actually surprising to me how much of my
"comfortable" environment is encapsulated in so few tools, and configured
with so few collections of files. There are other tools I use a lot too, but
most of them either have their own sync systems, or they have so few
configuration options (and are likely in a format that isn't easy to
grab/store) that it's not worth the bother.</p>
<p>This feels like a good thing, really.</p>
<p>One thing that's not amongst all of this, partly because it's not that
interesting, but also partly because the repository is private, is a single
bash script called <code>myenv</code>. On a new machine, once I've got enough of a
setup that I can clone from GitHub, I drag this down and run the script and
most of the rest of the environment follows.</p>
<p>It's quite satisfying when I need to use it.</p></div>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I moved into my current place back in August 2019, bringing with me a fairly
small desk. Originally, many years back, I'd had a pretty big office with
<em>lots</em> of office space but, upon moving up to Scotland back in 2016, I
needed to go with something a lot smaller.</p>
<p>Which was perfectly fine. Me and that desk wrote a lot of code. Me and that
desk <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">transitioned from one job to
another</a>, and then
<a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">another</a>. Me and that desk made
it through the pandemic.</p>
<p>It's been a good desk.</p>
<p>But it was small. I'm in a place where I could spread out a fair bit again,
but I also kept putting it off and putting it off.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I decided that it was high time I actually upgraded; I
also promised the desk to someone else who I know will get a <em>lot</em> of good
use out of it; so finally earlier this week I put in the order for something
bigger and fancier.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the help of a very good friend (thanks MariÃ«lle!), I got the
desk built and roughly in place, and then today I've been putting the
desktop back together and adding extra bits.</p>
<p><img alt="My new desk" src="/attachments/2023/07/08/new-desk.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>It's so nice to have more space to spread out, it's also nice to have a
black desk again! (the last one was white because... reasons) But what's
<em>really</em> exciting is that it transforms into a standing desk at the touch of
a button.</p>
<p>I've been trying it in the standing configuration today and, while I doubt I
could do a whole day of coding with it like that, I'm already really liking
it as a way of breaking up the time at the keyboard. On the days I work from
home, or the days of my own where I get sucked into a personal project, I
can absolutely see me swapping between the two states.</p>
<p>All that's left now is to get used to it. The screens are ever so slightly
further away, the height is ever so slightly different (although I can
adjust it, of course, but what I've done is adjust the sitting position to a
nicer one and that's going to take some getting used to), my iPad and Stream
Desk are in just a slightly different location, etc, etc... So I'm sure
there'll be a few days of sitting here and making small tweaks to the spot
where things live.</p>
<p>Before I know it I'll be used to it. It'll be "my spot".</p></div>

      <div><p>More than ever I'm listening to music while I work. Despite having grown up
in the 80s, and so having a good vinyl collection, and then having got into
buying all the CDs in the 90s and 00s, these days I have managed to embrace
the "just stream all the things" approach. After a long time using Spotify I
finally ended up migrating to Apple Music.</p>
<p>One of the things I do find Apple Music does well is the whole "you seem to
like this, have you tried this?" thing; which on occasion has resulted in a
pretty neat rabbit hole of discovery.</p>
<p>Earlier this year this happened with <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/109709660400107128">female-fronted Dutch goth/rock type
bands</a>. I don't even
remember how that happened, but it's a thing that happened and I gleefully
dived right in. I came away with a few names I didn't know before, but one
album has really stuck in my head and, now that we're just over 1/2 way
through the year, I feel it's the one that gets played more than anything
else.</p>
<p><img alt="Delain Dark Waters" src="/attachments/2023/07/06/Delain Dark Waters.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>This keeps creeping back to the top of things I'm playing; sometimes when
I'm in "bang on the keyboard lots" coding mode (you know the sort of coding
mode: where you don't have to think too much because you have a good plan
for what you're doing, but you've got a lot of tapping away to do), plus
also often while I'm in the car.</p>
<p>I won't be the least bit surprised to find that this ends up being my
most-played album this year. According to last.fm it's at the top of the
albums I've played (in places where I have scrobbling set up) in the last
365 days.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Well, it didn't take as long as I expected it to. Just <a href="/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html#considering-pelican">yesterday
morning</a> I was
giving <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> a look over as a possible engine
for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while
now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I
liked it and wondered how long it would take me to make the switch.</p>
<p>By the evening I was making a proper effort to get the switchover started,
and just a wee while earlier, before writing this post, the switch was made!</p>
<p>The process of making the switch was roughly this (and keep in mind I'm
coming from using Jekyll):</p>
<ol>
<li>Made a branch in the repo to work in.</li>
<li>Removed all of the Jekyll-oriented files.</li>
<li>Decided to set up Pelican and related tools in a virtual environment,
   managed using <code>pipenv</code>.</li>
<li>Ran <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick things off and give me a framework to
   start with.</li>
<li>Renamed the old <code>_posts</code> directory to <code>content</code>.</li>
<li>Kept tweaking the hell out of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/blob/main/pelicanconf.py">Pelican config
   file</a>
   until it started to look "just so" (this is a process that has been
   ongoing, and doubtless will keep happening for some time to come).</li>
<li>Tried out a few themes and settled on
   <a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex">Flex</a>; while not <em>exactly</em>
   what I wanted, it was close enough to help keep me motivated (while
   rolling my own theme from scratch would seem fun, I just know it would
   mean the work would never get done, or at least finished).</li>
<li>Did a mass tidy up of all the tags in all the posts; something I'd never
   really paid too much attention to as the Jekyll-based blog never actually
   allowed for following tags.</li>
<li>Went though all the posts and removed double quotes from a lot of the
   titles in the frontmatter (something Jekyll seems to have stripped, but
   which Pelican doesn't).</li>
<li>Tweaked the <code>FILE_METADATA</code> to ensure that the slugs for the URLs came
    from the filenames -- by default Pelican seems to slugify the title of a
    post and this meant that some of the URLs were changing.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all I probably spent 6 or 7 hours on making the move; a lot of that
involving reading up on how to configure Pelican and researching themes. The
rest of it was a lot of repetitive work to fix or tidy things.</p>
<p><em>The</em> most important aspect of this was keeping the post URLs the same all
the way back to the first post; as best as I can tell I've managed that.</p>
<p>So far I'm pleased with the result. I'm going to live with the look/theme
for a wee while and see how it sits for me. I'm sure I'll tweak it a bit as
time goes on, but at the moment I'm comfortable with how it looks.</p></div>

      <div><p>Since getting my blog editing environment set up on the "new" machine <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">a
couple of days back</a> I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog <a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html">back in 2015</a>, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912">mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new</a>, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.</p>
<p>One that looks promising so far is <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).</li>
<li>Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).</li>
<li>Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.</li>
<li>Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web">using the library when kicking
  off <code>ng2web</code></a>).</li>
<li>RSS feed generation.</li>
<li>Syntax-highlighted code blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.</p>
<p>Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.</p>
<p>Things got off to a good start with an easy install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;pelican[markdown]&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then used the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a <em>very</em> rough
version of my blog up and going.</p>
<p>It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.</p>
<p>I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a base theme that's to my taste.</li>
<li>Get Disqus working it so that any old comments remain in place.</li>
<li>Get my image/attachment layout back in place.</li>
<li>Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).</li>
<li>Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.</li>
<li>Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!</p>
<p>Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.
;-)</p>

<p>Ever since GitHub introduced the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme">profile
README</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
I've had a massively low-effort one in place. I made the repo, quickly wrote
the file, and then sort of forgot about it. Well, I didn't so much forget as
just keep looking at it and thinking "I should do something better with that
one day".</p>
<p>Thing is, while there are lots of fancy approaches out there, and lots of
neat generator tools and the like... they just weren't for me.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, over my second morning coffee, after <a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html">getting my blog
environment up and going again</a>, I had an
idea. It could be cool to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.save_screenshot">Textual's screenshot
facility</a>
to make something terminal-themed! I mean, while it's not <em>all</em> I am these
days, so much of what I'm doing right now is aimed at the terminal.</p>
<p>So... what to do? Then I thought it could be cool to knock up some sort of
login screen type thing; with a banner. One visit to an online large
terminal text generator site later, I had some banner text. All that was
left was to write <a href="https://github.com/davep/davep/blob/main/make_banner.py">a simple Textual application to create the
"screen"</a>.</p>
<p>The main layout is simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">compose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">ComposeResult</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NAME</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">classes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;banner&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PRATTLE</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;github.com/davep login: [reverse] [/]&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>where <code>NAME</code> contains the banner and <code>PRATTLE</code> contains the "login message".
With some <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/CSS/">Textual CSS</a> sprinkled
over it to give the exact layout and colour I wanted, all that was left was
to make the snapshot. This was easy enough too.</p>
<p>While the whole thing isn't fully documented just yet, Textual does have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.run_test">a
great tool for automatically running an application and interacting with
it</a>; that
meant I could easily write a function to load up my app and save the
screenshot:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_banner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">GitHubBannerApp</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run_test</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pilot</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">pilot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save_screenshot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;davep.svg&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, that needs running async, but that's simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">make_banner</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Throw in a <code>Makefile</code> so I don't forget what I'm supposed to run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nl">.PHONY:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">all</span>
<span class="nl">all:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">pipenv</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">run</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">python</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">make_banner.py</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and that's it! Job done!</p>
<p>From here onward I guess I could have some real fun with this. It would be
simple enough I guess to modify the code so that it changes what's displayed
over time; perhaps show a "last login" value that relates to recently
activity or something; any number of things; and then run it in a cron job
and update the repository.</p>
<p>For now though... I'll stick with keeping things nice and simple.</p>

      <div><p>So... erm... yeah... I did it again. I looked away for a moment and somehow
<a href="/2022/12/16/oidia.html">almost 7 months passed without a post</a>! It's so
easily done too isn't it? While, <a href="/2022/05/20/im-back.html">when I revived this blog last
year</a>, I didn't make a point of intending to write
lots and often, I had hope that I'd manage something at least once a week;
perhaps at least once a month.</p>
<p>Ahh well.</p>
<p>There's been two main reasons why it's been quiet around here. The first is
that <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">my (now not so) new job</a>
keeps me busy (in a good way). It involves a reasonable amount of trekking
into town and back (which I don't mind on the whole), and once I'm home in
the evening I'm generally (but not always) done with the keyboard and desk.</p>
<p>The second reason, which is probably the dafter one, is that a bit earlier
this year I finally upgraded my desktop setup from the 2019 Intel MacBook
Pro I was using to a recently-released M2Pro Mac Mini (and <em>what</em> an
upgrade!). How this plays into blogging being even more quiet is... I needed
to set up jekyll again, and I'd forgotten how I got it running in the first
place, so I kept putting off getting it going, and...</p>
<p>Well, this morning, I sat down with coffee, grepped the <code>history</code> on my
previous machine, and got it running in like 5 minutes (of course).</p>
<p>So, here I am, back adding another blog post. I'm writing this as much to
test that the setup works as anything else.</p>
<p>But also, this time, I'm going to try and make a promise to myself: I'm
going to try and write more. I can and should write about anything. I can
and should write short things as well as long things. I can and should
remember that it's not about writing things that are going to be super
important or anything like that, it's about just getting stuff down and
creating and recording.</p>
<p>Note of course I said "try" and make a promise.</p>
<p>We'll see. ;-)</p></div>

      <div><p>Another little thing that's up on PyPi now, which is the final bit of
fallout from <a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">the Textual dogfooding
sessions</a>, is a little project I'm
calling OIDIA.</p>
<p>The application is a streak tracker. I'm quite the fan of streak trackers.
I've used a few over the years, both to help keep me motivated and honest,
and also to help me track that I've avoided unhelpful things too. Now, most
of the apps I've used, and use now, tend to have reminders and counts and
stats and are all about "DO NOT BREAK THE STREAK OR ELSE" and that's mostly
fine, but...</p>
<p>To keep things simple and to purely concentrate on how to build Textual
apps, I made this a "non-judgement" streak tracker. It's designed to be
really simple: you add a streak, you bump up/down the number of times you
did (or didn't do) the thing related to that streak, for each day, and
that's it.</p>
<p>No totals. No stats. No reminders and bugging. No judgement.</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kz8eUzO9-8"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>When I started it, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to store the data.
Throwing it in a SQLite database held some appeal, but that also felt like a
lot of faff for something so simple. Also, I wanted to make the data as easy
to get at, to use elsewhere, and to hack on, as possible. So in the end I
went with a simple JSON file.</p>
<p>On macOS and GNU/Linux <code>streaks.json</code> lives in <code>~/.local/share/oidia</code>, on
Windows it'll be in... I'm not sure off the top of my head actually; it'll
be in whatever directory <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xdg/">the handy <code>xdg</code>
library</a> has chosen. and because it's JSON
that means that something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="OIDIA in action" src="/attachments/2022/12/16/oidia.png"></p>
<p>ends up looking like this:</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how well that actually scales; possibly not
so well over a long period of time, but this was written more as another way
to explore Textual than anything else. Even then, it would be pretty trivial
to update to something better for holding the data.</p>
<p>If this seems like your thing (and I will be supporting it and onward
developing it) you <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oidia/">can find it over on
PyPi</a>, which means it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or the ever-handy <code>pipx</code>:</p>

      <div><h1>An update</h1>
<p>So, it's fast approaching 2 months now <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">since I started the new
thing</a> and it's been a busy
time. I've had to adjust to a quite a few new things, not least of which has
been a longer and more involved commute. I'm actually mostly enjoying it
too. While having to contend with busses isn't the <em>best</em> thing to be doing
with my day, I do have a very fond spot for Edinburgh and it's nice to be in
there most days of the week.</p>
<p>Part of the fallout from the new job has been that, in the last couple of
weeks, I've thrown some more stuff up on PyPi. This comes about as part of a
bit of a dog-fooding campaign we're on at the moment (you can read some
background to this <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">over on the company
blog</a>).
While they have been, and will continue to be, mentioned on the Textualize
blog, I thought I'd give a brief mention of them here on my own blog too
given they are, essentially, personal projects.</p>
<h1>gridinfo</h1>
<p>This is one I'd like to tweak some more and improve on if possible. It is,
in essence, a Python-coded terminal tool that does more or less the same as
<a href="https://github.com/davep/slstats.el"><code>slstats.el</code></a>. It started out as <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1590476280457490434">a
rather silly quick
hack</a>, designed
to do something different with
<a href="https://github.com/darrenburns/rich-pixels"><code>rich-pixels</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here's the finished version (as of the time of writing) being put through
its paces:</p>

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gridinfo/">from here</a>, or install and
play with it with a quick <code>pipx install gridinfo</code>.</p>
<h1>unbored</h1>
<p>The next experiment with Textual was to write a terminal-based client for
the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">Bored-API</a>. My initial plan for this was to
just have a button or two that the user could mash on and they'd get an
activity suggestion dropped into the middle of the terminal; but really that
seemed a bit boring. Then I realised that it'd be a bit more silly and a bit
more fun if I did it as a sort of TODO app. Bored? Run it up and use one of
the activities you'd generated before. Don't like any of them? Ignore them
and generate some more! Feeling bad that you've got such a backlog of
reasons to not be bored? Delete a bunch!</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Here's a short video of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/unbored/">from here</a>, or install and play
with it with a quick <code>pipx install unbored</code>.</p>
<h1>textual-qrcode</h1>
<p>This one... this one I'm going to blame on the brain fog that followed flu
<em>and</em> Covid jabs that happened the day before (and which are still kicking
my arse 4 days later). Monday morning, at my desk, and I'm wondering what to
next write to experiment with Textual, and I realised it would be
interesting to write something that would show off that it's easy to make a
third party widget library.</p>
<p>And... yeah, I don't know why, but I remembered
<a href="https://github.com/davep/qrencode.el"><code>qrencode.el</code></a> and so
<code>textual-qrcode</code> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="The most useless Textal widget yet" src="/attachments/2022/12/01/textual-qrcode.png"></p>
<p>I think the most amusing part about this is that I did it in full knowledge
that it would be useless; the idea being it would be a daft way of showing
off how you could build a widget library as an add-on for Textual. But...
more than one person actually ended up saying "yeah hold up there this could
actually be handy!"</p>
<p>If you're one of those people... <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-qrcode/">you'll find it
here</a>.</p>
<h1>FivePyFive</h1>
<p>While I was on a roll putting stuff up on PyPi, I also decided to tweak up
my Textual-based 5x5 and throw that up too. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1554207518615814148">my first app built
with Textual</a>,
initially written before I'd even spoken to Will about the position here. At
one point I even did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual/blob/c4f60548922609133763c0e49f7b23aea5d44c2b/sandbox/davep/five_by_five.hy">a version in
Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>It's since gone on to become <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/tree/d2ba22b86f48f4ce5b0f55767efdcf1a5478b180/examples">one of the example apps in Textual
itself</a>
but I felt it deserved being made available to the world via an easy(ish)
install. So, if you fancy trying to crack the puzzle in your terminal, just
do a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>fivepyfive
</code></pre></div>

<p>and click away.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="343" height="610"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf34Z5r7Q60" title="FivePyFive -- A
little annoying puzzle for the terminal" frameborder="0"
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fivepyfive/">over here</a>.</p>
<h1>PISpy</h1>
<p>Finally... for this week anyway, is a tool I've called PISpy. It's designed
as a simple terminal client for looking up package information on PyPi. As
of right now it's pretty straightforward, but I'd like to add more to it
over time. Here's an example of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMGD6bXqIEo" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>One small wrinkle with publishing it to PyPi was the fact that, once I'd
chosen the name, I checked that it hadn't been used on PyPi (it hadn't) but
when it came to publishing the package it got rejected because the name was
too similar to another package! I don't know which, it wouldn't say, but
that was a problem. So in the end the published name ended up having to be
slightly different from the actual tool's name.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">over here</a> for the package, and
you can install it with a:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pispy-client
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then just run <code>pispy</code> in the terminal.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's been a fun couple of weeks coming up with stuff to help exercise
Textual, and there's more to come. Personally I've found the process really
helpful in that it's help me learn more about the framework and also figure
out my own approach to working with it. Each thing I've built so far has
been a small step in evolution on from what I did in the previous thing. I
doubt I've arrived at a plateau of understanding just yet.</p></div>

      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>On Twitter, a few weeks back, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsBexli/status/1577332548933500928">@itsBexli asked me how I go about setting up
Python for development on
macOS</a>. It's a
great question and one that seems to crop up in various places, and since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I
first got into using
macOS</a> and then
<a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">subsequently got back into coding lots in
Python</a> it's absolutely an issue I ran
into.</p>
<p>With my previous employer, while I was the only developer, I wasn't the only
person writing code and more than one other person had this issue so I
eventually wrote up my approach to solving this problem. That document is on
their internal GitLab, but I thought it worth me writing my personal
macOS/Python "rules" up again, just in case they're useful to anyone else.</p>
<p>I am, of course, not the first person to tackle this, to document this, to
write down a good approach to this. Before and after I settled on my
approach I'd seen other people write about this. So... this post isn't here
to try and replace those, it's simply to write down my own approach, so if
anyone asks again I can point them here. I feel it's important to stress:
this isn't the only way or thoughts on this issue, there are lots of others.
Do go read them too and then settle on an approach that works for you.</p>
<p>One other point to note, which may or may not make a difference (and may or
may not affect how this changes with time): for the past few years I've been
a heavy user of <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"><code>pipenv</code></a> to manage my
virtual environments. This is very likely to change from now on, but keep in
mind that what follows was arrived at from the perspective of a <code>pipenv</code>
user.</p>
<p>So... with that admin aside...</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>When I first got back into writing Python it was on macOS and, really early
on, I ran into all the usual issues: virtual environments breaking because
they were based on the system Python and it got updated, virtual
environments based on the Homebrew-installed Python and it got updated,
etc... Simply put, an occasional, annoying, non-show-stopping breaking of my
development environment which would distract me when I'd sat down to just
hack on some code, not do system admin!</p>
<h1>My Solution</h1>
<p>For me, what's worked for me without a problem over the past few years, in
short, is this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the system version of Python. Just don't.</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the Homebrew's own version of Python (I'm not even sure
   this is an issue any more; but it used to be).</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use a version of Python installed with Homebrew (or, more to
   the point, never install Python with Homebrew).</li>
<li>Manage everything with <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/"><code>pyenv</code></a>; which I do
   install from Homebrew.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Detail</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, what I'm writing here assumes that virtual
environments are being managed with <code>pipenv</code> (something I still do for
personal projects, for now, but this may change soon). Your choices and
mileage may vary, etc... This is what works well for me.</p>
<h2>The "one time" items</h2>
<p>These are the items that need initially installing into a new macOS machine:</p>
<h3>Homebrew</h3>
<p>Unless it comes from the Mac App Store, I try and install everything via
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. It's really handy for keeping track of what
I've got installed, for recreating a development environment in general, and
for keeping things up to date.</p>
<h3>pyenv</h3>
<p>With Homebrew installed the next step for me is to install <code>pyenv</code>. Doing so
is as easy as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pyenv
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once installed, if it's not done it for you, you may need to make some
changes to your login profile. I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a>
so I have <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/efc77fd20c4bd2f36eb628730787924b6a56fcfd/conf.d/python.fish#L21-L25">these lines in my
setup</a>.
Simply put: it asks pyenv to set up my environment so my calls to Python go
via its setup.</p>
<p>Plenty of help on how to set up <code>pyenv</code> can be found <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation">in its
README</a>.</p>
<p>Once I've done this I tend to go on and install the Python versions I'm
likely to need. For me this tends to be the most recent "active" stable
versions (as of the time of writing, 3.7 through 3.10; although I need to
now start throwing 3.11 into the mix too).</p>
<p>I use this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--list
</code></pre></div>

<p>to see the available versions. If I want to see what's available for a
specific version I'll pipe through grep:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--list<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>fgrep<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;  3.9&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is handy if I want to check what the very latest release of a specific
version of Python is.</p>
<h3>The "Global" Python</h3>
<p>When I'm done with the above I then tend to use <code>pyenv</code> to set my "global"
Python. This is the version I want to get when I run <code>python</code> and I'm not
inside a virtual environment. Doing that is as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>global<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, you'd swap the version for whatever works for you.</p>
<h3>When Stuff Breaks</h3>
<p>It seems more rare these days, but on occasion I've had it such that some
update somewhere still causes my environment to break. Now though I find
that all it takes is a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>rehash
</code></pre></div>

<p>and everything is good again.</p>
<h2>Setting Up A Repo</h2>
<p>With all of the stuff above being mostly a one-off (or at least something I
do once when I set up a new machine -- which isn't often), the real "work"
here is when I set up a fresh repository when I start a new project. Really
it's no work at all. Again, as I've said before, I've tended to use <code>pipenv</code>
for my own work, and still do for personal stuff (but do want to change
that), mileage may vary here depending on tool.</p>
<p>When I start a new project I think about which Python version I want to be
working with, I ensure I have the latest version of it installed with
<code>pyenv</code>, and then ask <code>pipenv</code> to create a new virtual environment with
that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you do this, you should see <code>pipenv</code> pulling the version of Python from
the <code>pyenv</code> directories:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.10.7

</code></pre></div>

<p>The key thing here is seeing that <code>pipenv</code> is pulling Python from
<code>~/.pyenv/versions/</code>. If it isn't there's a good chance you have a Python
earlier in your <code>PATH</code> than the <code>pyenv</code> one -- something you generally don't
want. It will work, but it's more likely to break at some point in the
future. That's the key thing I look for; if I see that I know things are
going to be okay.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since I adopted these personal rules and approaches (and really, calling
them "rules" is kind of grand -- there's almost nothing to this) I've found
I've had near-zero issues with the stability of my Python virtual
environments (and what issues I have run into tend to be trivial and of my
own doing).</p>
<p>As I said at the start: there are, of course, other approaches to this, but
this is mine and works well for me. Do feel free to comment with your own,
I'm always happy to learn about new ways!</p></div>
