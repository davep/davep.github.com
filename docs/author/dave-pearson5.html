  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html">just over a week
back</a>, last night I went to see a
Fringe show that was a production of <em>The Little Shop of Horrors</em>. Before
going I had no idea what to expect (in terms of how it would be done, not
what the content would be): I wasn't clear if it would be a really small
affair, or something on a bigger stage with reasonably high production
values (what can I say? It was LSoH, it was a Fringe show, it was booked
knowing nothing else).</p>
<p>When we got there and got into the venue it was... small, oh so very small!
No real set to speak of. The cast who were about to kick off the performance
didn't really seem to have much of a costume going on. So, without
judgement, I settled down to expect the next 90 minutes or so to be... a
Fringe experience.</p>
<p>First impressions were oh so wrong! While there was (for obvious reasons) a
lack of any real set, the effort that went into the performance really
worked and I absolutely enjoyed every single moment. Also, because it was a
production of the musical (which I haven't seen), rather than an adaption of
the movie (which I have), I got to experience a fresh ending (spoilers!).</p>
<p>The seats were uncomfortable. The room was down in the basement, with no
ventilation, and so was uncomfortably hot. Physically it wasn't a great
space to be. And yet I really wasn't wishing for it to be over. I think that
says a lot about the show itself.</p>
<p>I think special mention has to be given to the Audrey II models, of which
there were three different sizes. Someone put some real effort into them.</p>
<p>So, yeah, a fun night, topped and tailed with pre-show dinner and post-show
drinks with friends. I couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>Unless I last-moment book anything else over the next week, <a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html">there's one
more show to go</a> in my <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">push to go
and see at least one show per week of the
Fringe</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Sadly no photos. I wasn't sat in a great spot to take photos.</p></div>

      <div><p>That's a third show booked! This means that, <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html#off-to-see-nick-harper">as I
hoped</a>, I'm
going to manage at least one show a week for the Fringe!</p>
<p>Now, this one could be seen as a cheat, sorta, kinda. I've seen this show
before. But I liked it so much last year I <em>have</em> to see it again! The odd
thing about it was it's not something I would have gone for on my own, it's
technically not really my thing, but I got talked into it and I'm so glad I
was!</p>
<p>So a year back <a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle">MariÃ«lle</a> told me about
this wrestling show at the Fringe and how she wanted to go but nobody else
was interested and I was all <em>"yebbut wrestling though?"</em> and didn't think
much more about it. Eventually though, after some persuasion (I mean, an
hour or so at a show and some beers afterwards, how bad could it be
really?), I agreed to go. I expected to find it meh.</p>
<p><img alt="Cast of Mythos: Ragnarok 2022" src="/attachments/2023/08/15/IMG_7612.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Holy shit was it so much fun! Like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37r1CqMKLzM">seriously so much
fun</a>. I'd never realised that
wrestling was the best way to tell the tales from Norse mythology; turns out
that wrestling is absolutely the best way to tell the tales from Norse
mythology.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mythos-ragnarok">we're off back again this
year</a>. All booked,
not this weekend, the weekend after.</p>
<p>There might even be a beer afterwards. Perhaps not <em>quite</em> so many as last
year though.</p></div>

      <div><p>This evening I've spent more time working on <a href="/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html">the planned complete remake of
my personal website</a>, in this case
"porting" over many of the files that made up the old "miscellaneous stuff"
section of the site. If I'm honest, most if not all of the things in there
are no longer relevant (like: who really needs a shell script to make
<code>gnuplot</code> plots from files pulled off a 1990s-era Garmin handheld GPS
unit?), but I thought I'd keep them kicking around "just in case".</p>
<p>One wee section I wasn't going to get rid of though was my scans of three
pages from a UK magazine called <em>Personal Computer News</em>. These contain
<a href="https://www.davep.org/misc/grid-bike/">Grid Bike</a>; a game I wrote for the
VIC-20, all in BASIC, and got published. For my efforts I got a <em>huge</em>
cheque for Â£40! If that doesn't seem like much to you, trust me, to 1983 me
this was <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>I bought a 16k RAM pack with the money.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, while trying to improve some of the links in the text, I
decided to see if there was now an archive online somewhere and, sure
enough, there is: <a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews001-18Mar1983/">in the obvious
place</a>.
This means that my web site isn't the only copy of my program on the net. If
you go to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews041-21Dec1983/page/n9/mode/2up">December 21st 1983
edition</a>
and turn to around page 84, there I am!</p>
<p><img alt="The cover of PCN" src="/attachments/2023/08/14/PCN-cover.png#centre"></p>
<p>At this point I'm almost tempted to try and get an emulator up and running
and get the code going again. How much fun would it be to add a video to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">my
YouTube channel</a>, of me playing one of
the very first games I wrote?</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">Late on last year</a> I wrote about a
bunch of new things that I'd added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an
early <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">dog-fooding session we had at textual
HQ</a>.
Since then I've been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to
date with Textual.</p>
<p><img alt="Unbored" src="/attachments/2023/08/13/unbored.png#centre"></p>
<p>As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework,
but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there's still new ways of
doing things being designed so there's going to be the odd break in approach
now and again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/unbored">Unbored</a>, my kind of silly
self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x
for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with
0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple
of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn't crashing.</p>
<p>The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of
containers (they didn't used to receive focus by default, now they do so I
had to tell them not to again), and that was about it.</p>
<p>While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZsXGQQpFw">nifty little slide-in error dialog I'd
made</a>, and instead embraced
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/07/17/textual-0300-adds-desktop-style-notifications/">the new Textual notification
system</a>.</p>
<p>While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no <em>real</em> use to
anyone, I feel it's a pretty good barometer application, helping me check
what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual
application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual
dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested
way; for this though it's less crucial and is a good test of the state of
the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it'll be
helpful to me if it <em>does</em> break and they yell.</p></div>

      <div><p>This morning I've spent a wee bit of time tinkering with the configuration
of <a href="/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html">the planned complete remake of my personal
website</a>. As part of this I made an
effort to "port" over a section of the site. The choice for the first
section to move was easy enough: <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">Norton
Guides</a>.</p>
<p>Of all the parts of my old site, this is probably the most useful in terms
of <em>"contains information that isn't generally available out there on the
web elsewhere and some folk might find it useful"</em>. I mean, at some point in
the past, someone edited the Wikipedia page for Norton Guides and linked to
mine as a source.</p>
<p>So getting that one back up and running as soon as possible made sense.</p>
<p>I've not added <em>every</em> bit of Norton Guide code to the main page, instead
just pulling over and tidying up what was there before. On the other hand,
just hacking on Markdown makes it all so much easier so I may expand on it a
bit.</p>
<p>The really important part was moving over <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/file-format/">the file format
details</a>. This, I feel, is
the information that people will be looking for, if anyone is ever looking.</p>
<p>So, proper start made; there's content beyond the landing page. There's
still a lot to weed out and move over, and I think there's a lot of tweaking
and the like with the configuration to do too. But the ball is rolling now.
Ever time I get a spare hour and the desire to sit at my desk I can pick a
section, look it over, decide if it deserves to come over, and act on that.</p>
<p>Heck, at this rate I might even end up with an actively-maintained website
again!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">about a week back</a>,
my first show booked for this year's Edinburgh Fringe was to see <a href="https://harperspace.com/home">Nick
Harper</a>. It's been a long time since I've seen
him; far too long. As best as I can tell the last gig I made it to was in
2009.</p>
<p>Fourteen years. Shit's changed in that time, for me, for the world. O_o</p>
<p>On first getting into town it was warm and crowded, with that fun "town is
doing festival shit" vibe that I like, so I went and grabbed an ice cream to
kill some time until the venue opened. I knew I was in the right spot when,
as I stood on Chambers Street, enjoying the cooldown, the man himself dashed
passed, guitar case in hand!</p>
<p>When I got into the venue I grabbed a drink and tried to find a seat; most
were taken; except for one right at the front and off to the side. So I
grabbed it. Moments later Nick himself came over to say hello to the folk
sat in this spot. We had a wee chat about how long it was since I'd last
seen him, nattered about general stuff, and he said very nice things about
my hat.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2682.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>The gig itself was fantastic. While I love his recorded work anyway, Nick's
always been one of those artists who I enjoy most live. He's got this way of
singing and playing guitar that fills whatever time he's got to play; never
once have I ever found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it's near
the end; or if I have it's because I'm worried it'll be over soon.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2684.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>A good number of the tracks he played I didn't recognise; at least two of
them I know are from a new album that's coming, and I have to admit that
when I do listen to his stuff it's the earlier works that tend to go into
heavy rotation (I think the last album of his I bought was <em>The Last
Guitar</em>). But I loved everything I got to hear. I'll be diving back into
<a href="https://harperspace.com/shop">his catalogue</a> and also keeping an eye out
for the new release.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2689.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>While there was only an hour for his slot, he did manage to get a couple of
old favourites of mine in; I was delighted when he launched into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQAebSpqVw">By My
Rocket Comes Fire</a>, did a
wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH6TqeeM5ZY">She Rules My World</a>,
and even squeezed in a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yz7mQ_i6pg">Galaxy
Song</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2705.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>All too quickly though, the hour was up. It was kind of fitting that many of
the songs he did have on the set list were all about time (on purpose, I'm
sure). I'm happy to say I got to say a quick thank you and goodbye and then
it was time for me to head out of town again.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2701.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Seeing Nick brought back a lot of good memories, and reminded me that I need
to catch up on his more recent works. While most of his stuff doesn't seem
to be on Apple Music (what can I say, I'm very online these days when it
comes to music), I'm glad to see <a href="https://nickharper.bandcamp.com/">he's got a full
Bandcamp</a>, so I'll be paying that a visit!</p>
<p>I hope he swings back this way some time soon, not during the Fringe, and
with a proper long set. It's been too long since I got to enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTD03-3qgmg">him really
going for it and having a ton of
fun</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p><a href="/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html#home-pod-stuck-installing">A couple of weeks
back</a>
I mentioned home my main HomePod had got stuck installing 16.6 of the
software that runs it. This situation persisted for days after writing that
post and I kept promising myself that I was going to see if I could unstick
it by removing it from the Home, doing a factory reset and adding it back
again.</p>
<p>Of course, during the week that followed, I never got round to that. You can
imagine what it's like: no time in the morning, and by the time I get home
in the evening I want to watch TV and use the HomePod as the speaker for the
Apple TV, I don't want to be doing tech support shit.</p>
<p>The following weekend... yeah, I kinda forgot.</p>
<p>So, here I am, a couple of Saturdays on, it's early morning, I've had
breakfast and I'm having coffee and I think it's the perfect time to do
this. I hope the Home app my on iPad and... it's sorted!</p>
<p><img alt="HomePod all good again" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 07.25.44.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, yeah, it looks like it somehow managed to unstick itself in the end. A
quick test of some of the issues I was seeing suggested there was still an
issue, for example asking for the temperature in the bedroom would still
result in a <em>"working on it"</em> reply followed by it telling me it wasn't
responding. A quick reset seems to have fixed that.</p>
<p>I guess it's good to know: if it happens again, it'll keep on working as the
speaker for my Apple TV, and it'll eventually sort itself out even if I
don't muck about with a hard reset.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>And I'm off! This morning I spent a good amount of time going through the
sources for the old version of <a href="http://www.davep.org"><code>davep.org</code></a> and
removing everything that won't be needed any more, and also building up a
rough TODO list of things I may want to recreate as content.</p>
<p>With that done, <a href="/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html">as mentioned earlier
today</a>, I started work on
building the site around Pelican. Pretty quickly though I started to feel
that that was going to be a bad choice. While Pelican felt like a <em>perfect</em>
fit for this blog -- mainly because it seems to be very blog-oriented -- it
was feeling a bit clunky for a general website that would have a handful of
static pages at best; likely something I wouldn't be updating too often.</p>
<p>So I put it aside and went on with my morning, doing normal Friday domestic
stuff like the weekly supermarket shop. It was while I was out doing that
that I realised the obvious answer: use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">what we use for the Textual
docs</a> and what's been used for
<a href="https://label.dev/"><code>label.dev</code></a>: <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/">Material for
MkDocs</a>!</p>
<p>I've just spent about 40 minutes after lunch kicking that off and it was
really straightforward. Of course the result is horrifically cookie-cutter
in terms of its look -- such is the way that <code>mkdocs-material</code> sites end up
looking out of the box -- but I don't much care about that; what's important
is that I've got a placeholder page in place, and I've quickly built a
framework for writing and publishing the content.</p>
<p>So that's the plan: now that the welcome page is in place and there's
<em>something</em> on my domain that looks like a working website again I can start
to slowly drag in old content in a new format. Heck, if I'm careful I might
even be able to retain some of the old URLs!</p>
<p>Longer-term plans might involve finally sorting out <code>https</code> support (yes,
even today, my site is <code>http</code>-only), and perhaps adding some sort of RSS
feed so there's a record of when changes are made.</p>
<p>After that... hopefully that'll be about it and perhaps the website will
last another 22 years running on top of the same engine (actually that part
should be easier because the "engine" is now local and it generates a static
site).</p>
<p>The question then becomes who'll last longer, the site or me?</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had <code>davep.org</code> since very late 1999. Initially it started as a domain
used just for email; while I did have a website, around that time it was
still hosted on my then-ISPs hosting service, with a mirror on a friend's
web server.</p>
<p>A year or so later I finally did a proper revamp of my website and finally
settled on <code>www.davep.org</code> as the place to point people to. I <em>think</em>, when
I made that move, that's when I decided to write my own website engine in
php. It was fun. It worked. I didn't want to code backend stuff (I don't
think the backend vs frontend distinction was even a thing we were talking
about then) so hacking it together in an unholy mix of ruby to generate
various static files that live in the filesystem and then php to turn them
into actual HTML made sense.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p><img alt="The earliest version of davep.org I can find" src="/attachments/2023/08/11/davep-org.png#centre"></p>
<p>I heavily maintained the site for many years; keeping the same engine,
tweaking the styles, adding features and content. I figure some time around
2013 or 2014 I probably stopped being quite so active in messing with it,
and then in the last 5 or 6 years I've pretty much neglected it.</p>
<p>The neglect shows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... php has changed. Quiet a lot. It's one of those languages I
used back in the day and pay no attention to. Then earlier this week I
noticed that there must have been an update on the host and huge parts of my
site broke, lots of content missing, pretty much useless and dead in the
water.</p>
<p>I did briefly think about breaking out the latest and greatest php locally,
setting things up to investigate what's going on, and seeing if I could
breathe some more life into it; but really what's the point?</p>
<p>So after all these years I'm finally admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Right now, on the home page, I've just got a placeholder saying that bitrot
finally ate my website and that I'm going to start again from scratch.
That's my plan: given that <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">I had a good experience moving this blog over to
Pelican</a> I
think I'm going to build a new <code>www.davep.org</code> with Pelican. Where possible
I'll try and drag some of the old content over, but I'm also going to use
this opportunity to have a proper digital spring clean.</p>
<p>There's no planned timescale for this, but this morning I've spent an hour
or so over coffee, branching the repo for the site and pruning out all the
stuff I know I won't need and don't want.</p>
<p>I'll try and drop the odd update in here as things progress.</p></div>

      <div><p>I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)">Little Shop of
Horrors</a> for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.</p>
<p>And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.</p>
<p>Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.</p>
<p>So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="Poser for Little Shop of Horrors" src="/attachments/2023/08/10/IMG_2652.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would</a>, this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you <em>seen</em> how much there is on offer?).</p>
<p>So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors">a performance of Little Shop of
Horrors</a>.</p></div>
