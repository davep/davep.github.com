      <div><p>This just turned up in email a little earlier:</p>
<p><img alt="Yay! Spam!" src="/attachments/2015/11/06/Screen Shot 2015-11-06 at 13.16.30.png"></p>
<p>What's of particular interest is the email address this was sent to. It was
one that I only ever (to my knowledge) used for posts to Usenet. While my
gmail spam folder is filled with emails to that and other addresses I used
for Usenet over the years this is the first bit of "proper" spam I've had
to it in a long time.</p>
<p>It's signficant that it's some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBase">Xbase</a>-related
thing too. I think the Usenet group I posted to more than any other will have
been <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>. Unless I had some lapse of
judgement at some point in the late 1990s or early 2000s (I think I only got
the davep.org domain in 1999, now I think about it) the address this was sent
to was used nowhere else.</p>
<p>I've also never been a "Visual Objects and/or Vulcan.NET user". While I did
once own a copy of Visual Objects (two copies actually -- a beta and then a
final release) it wasn't in a way that I'd have been on some mailing list and
even if I had the address in question wouldn't have been the one used.</p>
<p>So, yeah, great way to impress me with a new product: make your first contact
with me look exactly like some old Usenet spam.</p>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> I've since had it confrimed by the sender of the email that
my address was indeed pulled from <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>A little earlier today I decided it was time that I read up a little more about
the abilities of OS X's Spotlight facility. I use it a little -- it's a handy
tool to get at some often-used applications that I don't really need laying
around in the dock -- but I was starting to wonder if I could get more out of
it.</p>
<p>The obvious first place to look was in the HelpViewer; all the information I'm
ever going to need will be on the local machine, right?</p>
<p>So I open the HelpViewer, from the Spotlight bar, and type in that I want
information about Spotlight. The page comes up blank. The page was pretty small
so, while I pondered why it might be blank, I resized it and it disappeared!
I tried to open it again and.... nothing. Nothing I did would make the
HelpViewer show again.</p>
<p>I then tried following the advice
<a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Troubleshooting_Help_Viewer">on this page</a> but
none of that appeared to help. I then looked for the HelpViewer in the
Activity Monitor and killed it with that.</p>
<p>Running it again after that got me back to where I started. I tried the while
process again and, sure enough, trying to resize the window made it disappear.
I can make it happen every single time:</p>

<p></center></p>
<p>So it looks like another fine example of the Apple "it just works" thing.
For "doesn't always just work" values of "just works".</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As much as I like my iMac, and as much as I am generally impressed with OS X
the more I use it, I'm constantly frustrated by the little issues I run into
that make life so much more interesting and which fly in the face of the
"it just works with Apple" fandom thing. The more I use the iMac, the more I
appreciate that Macs and OS X are just as "fun" as anything running Windows.</p>
<p>A little earlier was a good example. I wanted to share part of the iMac's
filesystem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">SMB</a>.
This seemed easy enough, the instructions on how to do it were clear and,
after following them, it utterly failed.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>So I Googled the issue a bit and ran into
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6629743?start=0&amp;tstart=0">this handy forum post</a>.
Apparently you can't actually connect with SMB if the account you're going to
be using to connect with is using iCloud login rather than a separate login.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Not an obvious thing. Nothing said this was the case. According to the forum
post even Apple couldn't help the person who'd been trying to make it work.
But at least there was a workaround. All I'd need to do is split the password,
have a login for the machine that <em>wasn't</em> the iCloud login and I'd be all good.</p>
<p>I did it, it worked. I could browse the iMac's filesystem from my Windows
machine and all was good (I'd been able to do this the other way around
for ages and with no problems whatsoever).</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to allow SMB for me" src="/attachments/2015/10/21/Screen Shot 2015-10-21 at 15.29.11.png"></p>
<p>Then I got curious.</p>
<p>What would happen if, once I had this set up, I "unsplit" the password and
went back to using the iCloud password to log in? That's when it got really fun.</p>
<p>To do this it asks you for the current password and also your iCloud password.
I entered both and...</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to allow SMB for me" src="/attachments/2015/10/21/Screen Shot 2015-10-21 at 15.28.46.png"></p>
<p>Yup. It refuses, every single time, to accept that the iCloud password I'm
entering is valid. Trust me, it is. I'm entering the correct password. I can
log in to the iCloud website with it just fine. But when I use it to try and
"unsplit" my password.... nope.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've even tried disabling SMB sharing for my account, and even turning off
SMB sharing altogether. This doesn't seem to make any difference. Right now,
as far as I can see, now that I've split the password I can't go back
despite the fact that there's a method of doing it made available.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p></div>

      <div><p>I have too many Microsoft accounts. Far too many. And they still confuse
the hell out of me.</p>
<p><img alt="Too many MS logins" src="/attachments/2015/10/19/Screen Shot 2015-10-19 at 12.05.30.png"></p>
<p>I found out over the weekend that the office was closing down the old internal
email server. Everything moving to Office365. I use Gmail for my email (I have
a freebie Google Apps account that I use as the front end for it -- when it
comes to things like email I'm Gmail all the way). So, as of today, I have
a new work-oriented Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Problem is, I already had a work-oriented Microsoft account because that's how
I use MSDN and download stuff from that.</p>
<p>I also have a personal outlook.com account for reasons I can't remember now.</p>
<p>And then there's the Windows gaming login, which might or might not be related
the the one above.</p>
<p>And then there's the old Xbox live account that I think has nothing to do with
the above.</p>
<p>And then...</p>
<p>The problem I have is that I never seem to be able to log in with an existing
MS account any time something new crops up, and so I somehow seem to end up
having to make a new one. And now I have too many and there's no obvious way
to merge them or kill them off without losing some service I don't even know
I need to use any more.</p>
<p>And then there's my two Skype accounts (personal and work)...</p>
<p>Make it stop! Please! And give me a merge facility!</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I woke up this morning to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRobotArm/status/651811143284076544">this</a> being retweeted by a few people I follow:</p>
<p><img alt="An effect of sanctions" src="/attachments/2015/10/08/ToryUK.png"></p>
<p>Even if I was to let my usual net-cynic side take over and decide there's a
good chance it's a made-up story there's no getting away from the fact that
this is a story that isn't in isolation. I hear this sort of thing time and
again; especially from people who have to deal with the fallout from this
first hand.</p>
<p>This is something that is happening, in 2015, in the country I live in.</p>
<p>I wish it wasn't.</p>
<p>This is why I find
<a href="/2015/09/07/labour-said-no-thanks-to-my-support.html">Labour's accusation of lying</a>
so damn annoying and frustrating. For a short while I simply decided that
that was that. They're as corrupt as the rest of them and only in it for the
money. This was made even more clear by how often they kept trumpeting the
new member numbers. It's all about the numbers -- all about the money.</p>
<p>But then I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYNPzJgV8TI">this video</a>:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYNPzJgV8TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>and got to thinking that perhaps, just perhaps, some change for the better
is actually happening inside Labour. Perhaps I should give the organisation
the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps, if I contacted the membership team and
asked <em>why</em> they'd decided I was lying, they'd give me the information and I
could sort things out.</p>
<p>So I did. I wrote to them. I sent this to them, via the form on their
website, on 2015-09-28:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 5th 2015 I received an email from you accusing me of
having lied when I sought to become a supporter, with a view to
applying to be a member after seeing the results of the leadership
election. This was a rather hurtful event and one I wrote about here:
http://blog.davep.org/2015/09/07/labour-said-no-thanks-to-my-support.html</p>
<p>Having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYNPzJgV8TI I find
myself in the odd position of liking the message of a party that, at
the same time, accused me of something without evidence.</p>
<p>Given this I'd like to get to the bottom of what happened, hopefully
find out what evidence was used to make the accusation and, perhaps,
get an apology so that I can seriously consider joining and supporting
what is happening.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, of course, gave all my full details -- the email address I'd used, my home
address, my full name, etc. All the information that I'd given when I signed
up as a supporter. From what I could tell they had everything they needed to
be able to check and give an adequate reply.</p>
<p>It took a while but I finally got a reply. This email came through on
2015-10-06:</p>
<p><img alt="Labour wants another tenner" src="/attachments/2015/10/08/Screen Shot 2015-10-08 at 10.26.19.png"></p>
<p>So that seems pretty clear: a non-answer to my question and they're asking
for another £10 on top of the £3 they already have off me to find out what
evidence they have that meant it was okay for them to take my £3 and then
accuse me of lying.</p>
<p>What's the betting that I'll spend that £10 and get a non-answer?</p>
<p>What's even more infuriating is that I'm not actually asking for information
they have on file about me, I'm asking for clarification for something they've
already told me.</p>
<p>It's really hard not to view this as a simple bait and switch.</p>
<p>So now I'm left wondering what to do next; trying to decide if I just give it
up as a bad job and accept that, really, nothing has changed and they're as
bad as ever. Corbyn might well be talking a good game but, under that cover,
it's still just another money-grabbing organisation that wants power and
very little change.</p></div>

      <div><p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a creature of habit. Once I get used to
something I find it hard to change. In many areas of my life there has to be
really compelling reasons to change something. I've found that this is the
case with my Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>When I first got it it took me a couple or so days to find a face that I was
happy with and, in the end, I went with <a href="http://www.pujiewear.com/">Pujie Black</a>,
along with a colour scheme I set up myself (called <em>RGB</em>, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p><img alt="Pujie Black with RGB face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Pujie Black.png"></p>
<p>Today though I stumbled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.marscity.sunlight&amp;hl=en_GB">Krona Sunlight</a>.
This face really got my interest. Part of the reason is that, while what I'm
wearing is normally called a "watch", I don't see it as a watch (just like
my phone isn't really a phone). It's a wearable Android device that gives me
handy info at a glance and lets me set reminders and things without even
having to reach for my phone, tablet, Chromebook or desktop machine.</p>
<p>This face fits perfectly into that.</p>
<p><img alt="Krona Sunlight face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Krona Sunlight.png"></p>
<p>While it lacks the battery information (edit to add: it doesn't lack battery
information, it's just an option that is off by default), and second time display, that Pujie
Black has, it more than makes up for it with the rather fantastic display
of weather and sunrise/set information -- especially how it displays temperature.</p>
<p>This was enough to not only have me buy a copy, but also to switch to it. I'm
going to be sticking with it for the next couple of days to see how I feel
about it and see if I miss any of the other information.</p>
<p>This might be a little bit of change I can cope with.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Almost a week ago (yes, I have being meaning to write something down about
this and have kept failing to do so) my iMac told me that there was a new
version of the OS waiting for me. While this is doubtless no big deal for
most Mac owners, this was interesting to me because it's the first time
I've experienced an OSX upgrade since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I got the iMac</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="El Capitan downloading" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.01.37.png"></p>
<p>The download took a while and, while the install had a couple of curious
bumps along the way, nothing seemed to actually go wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="About to get going" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.18.png"></p>
<p>The two main things I noticed were that it seemed to take the installer an
absolute age to close down all running apps before it got to doing the
installation. The other was that Mac progress bars seem to have a very odd
way of calculating things. Often it would tell me that there was (for example)
28 minutes to go, it'd stay like that for 20 minutes, then drop 5 minutes,
then appear to finish very soon after.</p>
<p><img alt="The final countdown" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Mostly though I just left it alone and let it do its own thing. While the whole
process took quite a while, it came back just fine (if I'm fair I'm not sure
it took much more time than when I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to
Windows 10).</p>
<p>The changes and improvements aren't really that obvious. I think I would say
that the machine feels a little quicker in places, but nothing I can really
put my finger on. One of the things I do like is the new split-screen facility
for full-screen apps. While I don't use the full-screen facility <em>that</em> much
I have found the need to split the screen before.</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements I've read about seem to involve things I'm
never going to use: either improvements to Safari (Chrome all the way for
me), the Mac Mail app (Gmail all the way for me, with <a href="http://www.kiwiforgmail.com/">Kiwi for Gmail</a>
being my client of choice on the iMac) or various iOS-oriented things which
are of little use (while <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I do own an iOS device</a> it's not one I use much).</p>
<p>Overall the thing I'm taking away from this is that the upgrade was smooth,
nothing was obviously broken or changed in a way that was confusing (unlike
some Windows or ChromeOS updates I've experienced in the past) and I didn't
have to do anything that required much in the way of knowledge to keep it
all going.</p>
<p>Doubtless that won't always be the case, such is the nature of OS upgrades.</p></div>

      <div><p>While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">my iMac</a>.</p>
<p>One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:</p>
<p><img alt="Support details of the iMac" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.14.png"></p>
<p>Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.23.png"></p>
<p>Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o</p>
<p>I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.30.55.png"></p>
<p>About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.</p>
<p>So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've never been a member of a political party. Ever. The main reason is I'm not
that much of a "joiner" and I tend to dislike making compromises on subjects
that actually matter. I have been a member of political causes in the past
but even those I've had to leave because of the struggle I felt when it came
to being associated with actions I disagreed with (yes, I am looking at you
<a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/">National Secular Society</a>). While there are
plenty of causes that I support, either in spirit or in actual donations, I
almost never actually join up.</p>
<p>I've also been a fairly flexible supporter of candidates in general elections.
While my politics are very much what you'd call "left" my voting patterns
tend to be related to how suitable I find a candidate from the parties that
I find I have a lot of overlap with in terms of stated aims. Unsurprisingly,
for all of my voting life, this has been a case of selecting from Labour
or LibDem candidates (with the odd look at the Green candidate). When doing so
one of the major factors in making the choice has been tactical voting given
that, for most of my life, I've lived in (what normally appeared to be) Tory
safe seats.</p>
<p>But, for many reasons, I've always felt an important connection to Labour.</p>
<p>Possibly one of the best moments, in political terms, was that night in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997">1997</a>,
as I drove back home, down the M3 from London, listening to the radio, hearing
Tory after Tory fall and realising that, for the first time in my (politically
concious) life, I was going to enjoy the benefits, we were all going to enjoy
the benefits, of a Labour government. This was such a sweet victory after
having really felt the defeat of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>The Blair horror show that followed was.... horrific. I don't think I've ever
felt as let down by an organisation as I did by that Labour government.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this year and I was really hopeful that, perhaps, Labour would
be back in government, and this time, lessons would have been learnt. I wasn't
as enthusiastic as before but I was cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>Sadly, it wasn't to be.</p>
<p>After this happened, and looking around me and seeing where we were now and
where we were heading, I found myself thinking that, perhaps, this time, it
was time to break my "no joining" rule. I started to seriously consider joining
Labour, lending some sort of support, somehow being involved and taking part.</p>
<p>That's when I first noticed the whole business of being able to take part in
the Labour leadership election by being a supporter. This seemed like the
perfect way to dip my toe in, see how I felt about being associated in some
way, get a feel for how things worked and, perhaps, depending on how it all
went, actually join.</p>
<p>So I paid my £3.00 and looked forward to the process that was to follow.</p>
<p>I then waited, and waited, and waited, and then on Saturday this happened:</p>
<p><img alt="I got purged" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/IGotPurged.png"></p>
<p>In other words.... I got <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/labourpurge">purged</a>.</p>
<p>And a couple of events before this have me wondering and a little suspicious
of how this went down.</p>
<p>I'll make clear here though: my application to be a supporter was 100%
genuine. As I say above, this was a first step on a road that I felt might
actually end up with me joining a party -- something I've never done before.
It wasn't something I did lightly. It was something I did after conversations
with a couple of other people where the conversations were about genuine
concern with how our country is shaping up right now.</p>
<p>Even as late as a week before I got the above email I was having a conversation
with my nephew who, I'm deeply proud to say, is a very politically-aware
teenager (far more than I was at his age) and is actually a member of the
Labour Party. The conversation was about how I was starting to trust the party
again and how I was even considering joining depending on how events went.</p>
<p>My application wasn't some joke thing, wasn't done on a whim, wasn't done to
try and skew any result. It was done because it was something I cared about
and wanted to explore further.</p>
<p>Anyway, come late on last week I'd had no sort of ballot email and, prompted
by a couple of emails from a couple of the leadership campaign groups, I
filled in the form to ask them to hurry it up. I think it was late on Thursday
evening (2015-09-03) or early Friday morning (2015-09-04).</p>
<p>A little later on Friday this happened (Anroid twitter):</p>
<p><img alt="A follow from someone involved in Labour" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screenshot_2015-09-07-11-07-16.png"></p>
<p>Same follow as seen from Tweetdeck:</p>
<p><img alt="A follow from someone involved in Labour" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screen Shot 2015-09-07 at 16.17.06.png"></p>
<p>I've no idea who <a href="https://twitter.com/polycarponkundi">@polycarponkundi</a> is
but it seemed clear from their timeline that they are a Labour supporter or
even member and that they are a strong supporter of the Liz Kendall leadership
campaign.</p>
<p>I didn't think too much of the follow; it seemed like an unusual coincidence
that I'd chase up my ballot email and then someone apparently involved in
the party would follow me, but coincidences happen.</p>
<p>Then, the following day, I get the letter telling me to sod off. Suddenly the
coincidence seems less of a coincidence. I go and check the profile and notice
that they've even unfollowed me, just a couple of days after the follow.</p>
<p><img alt="That account no longer follows me" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screen Shot 2015-09-07 at 16.21.45.png"></p>
<p>Note the lack of "follows @davepdotorg" in the profile?</p>
<p>Very odd.</p>
<p>Right now I'm not drawing any firm conclusions about what happened, and I have
<a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/640829279966765056">asked them what the follow and unfollow was all about</a>.
It would be unfair of me to decide the events were connected without asking
first.</p>
<p>All of this though has made something clear to me. Labour have decided that
they never want my support, ever again. I have it in writing. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>What I actually have in writing is an email that says <em>"we're taking and keeping
your £3.00 and we're calling you a liar while we do this. If you want to
prove that you're not a liar you need to actually join us, actually send us
even more money. Oh, and by the way, we're not going to tell you what evidence
we have that you're a liar, so ner."</em></p>
<p>Thank you Labour. At least I know where I stand now. You can safely assume
that you'll never have my support ever again.</p></div>
