      <div><p>Over the past couple or so
weeks <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">my Macbook air</a> has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"></p>
<p>Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.</p>
<p>So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.</p>
<p>I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.</p>
<p>I joined the queue.</p>
<p>About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.</p>
<p>By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p>So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.</p>
<p>Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday I got the call about the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app that
I was <a href="/2016/10/29/virgin_east_coast_20.html">promised last week</a> (well,
actually, promised a couple of months back). It didn't go well.</p>
<p>Well, I say "didn't go well", the conversation itself went very well, the
chap I spoke to was polite and apologetic and helpful, but the outcome
wasn't really very brilliant.</p>
<p>It didn't get off to a brilliant start when I was first told that the
solution to my problem was that I needed to uninstall and then reinstall the
app (something I've done more than once while trying to get to the bottom of
the problem). I asked if that was really necessary and I was informed that
it was the only way to fix the problem of the tickets not showing. Problem
is... that wasn't my problem. So I then had to explain the exact nature of
the fault I was experiencing (and also explained my guess as to what the
cause of the problem was).</p>
<p>After that, much of the content of the conversation involved vaguely
confidential information (nothing too terrible or that big a secret -- just
stuff that isn't generally known yet) which I'm not going to repeat here.
The upshot of the chat though is this: they can't do anything for me.</p>
<p>Simply put: they acknowledge there's a problem with the app, the problem is
at their end, it's a problem that needs to be fixed and there's nothing they
can do to fix it any time soon.</p>
<p>The causes of this will sound familiar to anyone with experience of large
companies who outsource much of their development and get involved in areas
that they might not have much experience with.</p>
<p>I also found out the cause of <em>some</em> of the delay in actually getting back
to me: the person who was supposed to originally call me went on maternity
leave just after they'd first tried to call and, it seems, nobody thought to
pick up their workload. This left me in the bizarre position of trying to
call someone who was off work for an extended period of time, and whose
phone wasn't being answered in any way.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't explain why that person's boss, who I was promised a
call from a short while after, never bothered to call.</p>
<p>So, I think, to some degree, that's the end of this silly saga. Their
software is buggy, they can't fix it any time soon, and I'm out of luck.</p>
<p>As for the extra free tickets I was promised a couple of weeks back now...
they've still not appeared. Time for me to chase that up <em>again</em>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>The other day I stumbled on a tip about Evernote. It
was
<a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/10/28/one-student-made-productivity-habit/">a snippet of information in a bigger post on the Evernote blog</a>
so I saved it to Evernote (obviously) to take a look at later.</p>
<p>The tip was that Ctrl-Cmd-B in Evernote (on the Mac) will format a body of
text as source code. While I'm not in the habit of using Evernote to store
code, not even snippets of code (that's something far better served
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>), it seemed like something worth
committing to memory.</p>
<p>This morning, while finally in front of a suitable machine, I took a look.
Sure enough, there's the menu option.</p>
<p><img alt="Code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.36.42.png"></p>
<p>Handy! So I created a test note with some code in it so that I could see how
it formatted it. I was curious to see if it just did simple fixed text or if
it offered options to highlight various languages (I didn't hold out much
hope for the latter, but it was worth a look).</p>
<p>That's when it got odd.</p>
<p>After I created a note and went to format some code, the menu option
disappeared!</p>
<p><img alt="Lack of code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.37.07.png"></p>
<p>From what I can tell, once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. At
least, not until you actually close down Evernote and start it up again.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, none of this is the case in the Windows version. While the
key combination is different there, the menu option is available and stays
available.</p>
<p>The version of Evernote I have (on my iMac and my Macbook) is 6.9.2. The
version number on Windows is 6.4.2 (after checking for updates -- I'm going
to guess that the Mac and Windows version numbers don't match on purpose).</p>
<p>Goodness knows what's going on here. All I can imagine is that it has
something to do
with
<a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/97731-code-block-in-evernote-for-mac/">a thread I found on Evernote's support forum</a> that
suggests that code block formatting is some sort of test/beta feature and
can only be enabled via a settings option that <em>isn't</em> available via the
version downloaded from the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>So, at some point, I guess I'm going to have to uninstall Evernote from the
Macbook and the iMac, reinstall from the Evernote website itself, and try
this again. All of which seems a bit silly when <em>the menu option is there
and visible when I run Evernote up!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> Sure enough, removing the App Store version and installing
the version from Evernote's own website, and <em>then</em> going into preferences
and enabling the option, sorted it. It's still really odd they'd promote the
facility via the blog and not mention it, and also very odd that the option
would always show until the first time you're in a position to use it, and
then it'd disappear.</p></div>

      <div><p>After my <a href="/2016/10/27/virgin_east_coast_19.html">last post</a> I sent off an
email to chase up what was happening with the promised phone calls about the
Ticket Wallet app and the general delays with getting things sorted. Here's
what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi again Mike.</p>
<p>It's now a week since you replied and, I think it's fair to note, it's no
longer "early" this week. I've had no call -- neither form yourself nor
from anyone related to the Ticket Wall App -- and I've not received the
promised tickets either. While I do try to be patient I have to admit that
it's starting to get very frustrating, being made lots of promises about
progress that simply never happen. This has been going on for months now
and I'm always having to chase things up.</p>
<p>I'd very much appreciate it if you could explain to me what's going on,
and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A while later I got a reply. He said he'd be getting the tickets in the post
the following day (so a Friday, which I think I can safely say isn't the
start of the week) and would also phone me.</p>
<p>The following day he did keep his promise. He called (I managed to miss him
the first time, but when I was finally free I called back and we got to
chat). He promised I'd get some more tickets early next week and also that
someone with technical knowledge would finally call about the app problem.</p>
<p>I have, of course, been here before. This is exactly the promise that was
made a couple of months ago. It's easy to make the promise, apparently not
so easy to deliver on it (or address the issue of not delivering on it).</p>
<p>So now I wait. Again. I'll be sure to update when something happens (or
doesn't).</p></div>

      <div><p>I think I need to rethink the meaning of the word "certainly". Anyone still
bothering to read this blog will recall
that, <a href="/2016/10/24/virgin_east_coast_18.html">last week</a>, the Customer
Relations Manager at Virgin East Coast said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can leave this with me I will certainly be in contact early next
week to try and get this resolved once and for all. In the meantime I will
pop a further couple of tickets in the post for you, just so you have them
incase you need to travel urgently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That email was received last Thursday evening. It's now the following
Thursday. Personally I'd take "certainly", in the above, to mean that
there's little to no chance that I won't be contacted in the early part of
this week, and that there's little to no chance that the tickets won't
arrive in the early part of this week.</p>
<p>I'd have thought that "certainly" would be used to create a huge contrast
between what has gone on before, and what will follow.</p>
<p>But, like I say, it's Thursday the following week and I've had no call from
anyone about the Ticket Wallet app, I've had no call or email from Mike (the
Customer Relations Manager) and the tickets haven't tumbled through the
door.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised. I'm not in the least bit surprised. I am, however, rather
disappointed.</p>
<p>And, of course, I'm now going to have to chase things up <em>again</em>.</p></div>

      <div><p>Late on last week some progress was made <a href="/2016/10/19/virgin_east_coast_17.html">with the issue of no longer being
able to contact Mike at Virgin East Coast</a>.
After chasing up via twitter (mentioning the MD as well as the normal
support account) I finally got a reply from the support account, saying
they'd get a message to Mike and let him know what was going on.</p>
<p>I wasn't really very hopeful about it, if I'm honest. If I couldn't get a
reply from him via the channels I'd normally used what hope was there that
I'd get a reply this way?</p>
<p>The following day was mostly spent traveling but my phone was on and always
to hand. I never received any call. However, late in the day I did get an
email! This was the first direct contact, that replied to an attempt to
contact him on the current issue, I'd had from the Customer Relations
Manager since the previous month.</p>
<p>Here's what he said (quoted in full):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My sincere apologies for the silence, I have been away and it was remiss
of my not to advise my regular contacts, of my colleagues details.</p>
<p>If you can leave this with me I will certainly be in contact early next
week to try and get this resolved once and for all. In the meantime I will
pop a further couple of tickets in the post for you, just so you have them
incase you need to travel urgently.</p>
<p>My apologies again David, and I look forward to chatting early next week.</p>

<p>I am, of course, a little skeptical of this at the moment. A few times
before I've been told they'll be in contact "early next week", or something
similar, and nothing has happened. It'll be interesting to see if this will
be different.</p>
<p>Will I get an update? Will I finally get a call about the Ticket Wallet app?
Will the extra tickets turn up?</p></div>

      <div><p>The Virgin East Coast Trains saga gets more and more odd. Following on from
<a href="/2016/10/18/virgin_east_coast_16.html">yesterday's update</a> I thought I'd
give Mike an actual call. As in, a call on the phone.</p>
<p>I don't generally like calling people. I'm one of those people who gets a
little anxious about using the phone and much prefer email. I'll use a phone
as a last resort and, given how long this was going on for, I thought it
time to break my normal "no phone" rule and pick mine up and call to find
out what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Turns out the number is no longer available!</p>
<p>The last email I have that was sent from Mike was on September 25th. The
number I used was the one in the footer of that email. It doesn't work.
There's also a land line given. Calling that gives the same result.</p>
<p>As of now, if I try and call the customer relations manager for Virgin East
Coast Trains, someone who I was referred to
by <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">David Horne</a> (the MD), I get a message
that the phone isn't available.</p>
<p>I...</p>
<p>Erm...</p>
<p>What?!?</p>
<p>So, given that, I thought I'd drop David a direct message on twitter. We'd
spoken that way back on August 9th when he requested my contact details.
Nope. Can't send him a DM any more. Guess I got unfollowed.</p>
<p>So I've tried tweeting him instead:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">@DavidHorne</a>, I seem to no longer be able to contact the <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> customer relations manager (your idea originally). What next?</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/788687898111516672">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>This did get a reply
from <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> and I let them
know what I was after. They say they've sent him an email too now:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">@davepdotorg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">@DavidHorne</a> I have just sent an email Mike and asked for him or one of the team to contact you asap. ^SH</p>&mdash; Virgin Trains EC (@Virgin_TrainsEC) <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC/status/788691702265552896">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>Really, this is a silly mess again. My query is simple and straightforward.
I'm simply chasing up two promises that were made by Mike, on behalf of
Virgin. All I seem to be getting now on those two points is complete
silence.</p>
<p>I'm really not in the business of telling people how to do their jobs but...
wouldn't customer relations involve actually talking to customers and
delivering on promises made to them when you do talk to them? That strikes
me as the sensible thing to do.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's now almost 2 weeks
since <a href="/2016/09/29/virgin_east_coast_15.html">I last posted an update here</a>
and, frustratingly, I don't really have much progress to write about.</p>
<p>What had been a promising start (well, middle; the actual start of this
process was as frustrating as hell; it was
only <a href="2016/08/10/virgin_east_coast_12.html">when the MD got involved</a> that
things actually started to happen) has turned into more of the same: broken
promises and lack of actual results.</p>
<p>Only, this time, I'm not dealing with some call center. This time I'm
dealing with the office of <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">David Horne</a>.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote I've emailed Mike Ross three times. The first time was to
chase up what was happening with the promised phone call regarding the
Ticket Wallet app. Here's what I wrote 12 days ago (on 2016-10-06):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Mike.</p>
<p>Just wanted to try and chase up what's happening with being able to speak
with someone about the original problem with the Ticket Wallet app. It's
now around 2 months since I missed the single call from Katie Fisher
(which I attempted to return every day for a week after, and a couple of
times the second week after -- never able to leave a message because there
was no voicemail system). It's now also over a month since you said that a
David Ridley (you you said was Katie's boss) would contact me and I've
still not had any sort of call.</p>
<p>With respect, this is exactly the sort of thing that I initially found
frustrating about dealing with Virgin East Coast Trains: the promises of
calls to get things sorted that never happen and the constant need, on my
part, to chase things up to even try and get something happening.</p>
<p>It's also nearly 4 months since I first ran into the original problem and
I'm still no nearer getting an explanation as to what the problem is or
any nobody would initially believe the problem I was reporting.</p>
<p>Could I please get an honest update on what's happening with this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This got no reply whatsoever. Now, I appreciate that people can be busy, but
when you have an ongoing issue to resolve with someone it makes sense you at
least say something like "I'm sorry, my attention is elsewhere at the moment
-- I promise I'll get back to you as soon as possible". That's not an ideal
thing to do, especially if your job us customer relations, but at least it
lets the customer know you're there and listening.</p>
<p>But, no, nothing.</p>
<p>So 5 days ago I replied to the above, with a little chaser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Mike. Sorry to trouble you but given it's a week since I wrote, I
wanted to chase this up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And still nothing.</p>
<p>Later this week I'll be on the trains again and, despite getting no sort of
reply whatsoever from Mike, I decided to drop a line anyway and ask for seat
reservations to be made (as had originally been offered). These were done in
no time at all.</p>
<p>While that is great it also tells me something rather odd: my emails are
being read and acted upon -- at least when they're a request for a seat
reservation -- but they're not being replied to.</p>
<p>And here's the thing that's even <em>more</em> frustrating about this. The email
where I requested the seat reservations had this on the end as a PS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: Did you receive the catch-up email I sent last week? Seeing as how I'm
about to use the last set of tickets you provided me I'm very keen to get
to the bottom of the Ticket Wallet app problem so I can finally resolve
the problem of getting WiFi on the train and working without having to
spend £10 extra every time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That has to have been read and... given the lack of reply I can only
conclude that it was ignored. I like to think it wasn't really ignored but a
lack of reply looks <em>exactly</em> like you're being ignored.</p>
<p>At this point I don't know what to make of this any more. It's a simple
problem I'm trying to get to the bottom of. I've been made plenty of good
promises, almost all of them broken. On top of that I can't really escalate
the issue any more because I'm already receiving the best help that Virgin
East Coast's MD can offer, apparently.</p>
<p>Anyone got Richard Branson's phone number?</p></div>

      <div><p>It's now a week
<a href="/2016/09/22/virgin_east_coast_14.html">since I last wrote an update</a> and,
given that I'm sat on a Virgin East Coast train right now, I thought I'd do
another.</p>
<p>As mentioned last time, I'm currently waiting for a call from someone at
Virgin East Coast regarding the ongoing situation with the Android Ticket
Wallet application. It's
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">now over 3 months since I first ran into the problem</a>
(and, of course, ran into all the issues of trying to get some sensible help
and response from them) and nothing has really improved:</p>
<p><img alt="Still can't log in" src="/attachments/2016/09/29/Screenshot_20160929-125339.png"></p>
<p>It's now <a href="/2016/08/10/virgin_east_coast_12.html">around six weeks</a> since I
was promised a call from someone who works on the application; a call that
did come the once but I couldn't answer at the time (I'm not the sort of
person to fiddle with a phone while driving) and which I attempted to return
for the better part of 2 weeks afterwards but never even got an answer to
the calls.</p>
<p>It's now also 3 weeks since I was told that I'd get a call from the boss of
the person who was originally supposed to call me. I've yet to receive a
call from them too. I've mentioned this to Mike Ross on a couple of
occasions now and haven't had any sort of direct reply as to what's going on
with that situation.</p>
<p>While I am enjoying the benefits of the tickets I was provided as
compensation from the earlier troubles (and also very much appreciating
Mike's reserving of seats for me when I need them -- I do find that booked
seats take a lot of stress out of traveling) I'd really love to get to the
bottom of the problem with the Ticket Wallet app.</p>
<p>Frustratingly and amusingly I suspect I'll finally get an answer around the
time I don't need to use the train quite so much.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's now
<a href="/2016/09/02/virgin_east_coast_13.html">about 3 weeks since my last post about my exploits in getting a problem solved with Virgin East Coast</a>
so now's a good time for a little update.</p>
<p>Two things were "outstanding" the last time I wrote about this. One was that
Mike (the customer relations manager in
<a href="https://twitter.com/davidhorne">the Virgin East Coast MD</a>'s office) wanted
us to meet up for a coffee and a chat about my issues and how things were
progressing, etc. Sadly I wasn't able to make the original date we'd picked
out as a possible so another date was arranged. At least, it was kind of
arranged. It was noted that this week might be a good time to meet and I'd
written back to him to say that Wednesday 21st would be good. Since then
I've had no reply at all.</p>
<p>The second thing that is outstanding is having someone call me about the
issues with the Ticket Wallet app. I've yet to receive a call from the
person who originally phoned me and who I missed (and who I chased up every
day for a week afterwards). I was then told by Mike, about 2 weeks or so
back, that that person's manager would call me instead and that I should
expect a call early last week.</p>
<p>That call didn't happen. Didn't happen early last week, late last week, at
all last week. It's now Thursday this week and I've still not had a call.</p>
<p>Just this morning I've chased up both of the above.</p>
<p>It's
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">now over 3 months since I first reported the Ticket Wallet app problem</a>
and I seem to be no closer to seeing it resolved, or even having an
explanation as to the cause of the problem.</p></div>
