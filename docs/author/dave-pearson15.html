      <div><p>Another update to the saga of trying to get the Virgin East Coast Ticket
Wallet app up and running.</p>
<p>Late on yesterday afternoon (a Sunday, it has to be said, so that's some
dedication to solving the problem) I got a reply to
<a href="http://blog.davep.org/2016/06/18/virgin_east_coast_2.html">the email I'd sent them previously</a>. It
didn't contain anything in response to what I'd written (so it looks like
I'm never going to find out what a TOC is! <em>sadface</em>) but it did say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Dave Pearson,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>Please attempt to change your password via the ‘forgotten password’
process.</p>
<p>Once you have amended your password, please attempt to sign into your
Virgin Trains East Coast Ticket Wallet App.</p>
<p>I apologise for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll admit that I wasn't convinced by this plan. There was no explanation as
to why I'd want to change my password, or why I'd want to pretend that I'd
forgotten my password (I hadn't forgotten it, obviously), there wasn't a
suggestion that something had been changed or fixed such that this would
tickle a solution into working. It appeared to imply that I'd actually
forgotten my password and that I should go about setting it again.</p>
<p>Fair enough... I did. It didn't make a jot of difference. Same problem. I've
written back to say so.</p>
<p>The actual act of saying I'd forgotten my password was a little odd. I did
the obvious thing of going to the
<a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/">main website</a> and saying I wanted
to sign in.</p>
<p><img alt="Sign in on main site" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.28.31.png"></p>
<p>Once clicked, that took me to the actual login page, which has the link to
say you've forgotten your password.</p>
<p><img alt="Link to reset password" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.29.07.png"></p>
<p>When you click on that link you get taken to.... a login page!</p>
<p><img alt="Another login page" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.29.28.png"></p>
<p>There you then have to say, again, that you've forgotten your password. Only
once you've done that do you get somewhere where you can say you've actually
forgotten your password.</p>
<p><img alt="Finally I can reset" src="/attachments/2016/06/20/Screen Shot 2016-06-20 at 10.29.42.png"></p>
<p>Not horrific, of course, but a rather odd route, needing to click pretty
much the same link twice to say the same thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried it, it didn't work, they've had an email to say as much. Now
I wait for the next step.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This morning I called back on
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">the number I'd been given yesterday evening</a>. I
explained briefly why I was calling and how I was returning someone's call
but, sadly, ended up back in support script-following hell: they started
asking for booking reference and all that stuff again. I stopped them,
explained the issue <em>again</em>, and they then started to ask for ticket details
and so on.</p>
<p>Deeply frustrating. The problem I had was that I was trying to set
everything up so I could even stand a chance of booking a ticket. How could
I have a ticket I could tell them about if I'd not even got to that part?</p>
<p>When I made this clear, in as polite but firm way as possible, I was passed
onto that person's supervisor.</p>
<p>As luck would have it he was the person who'd called and left a message last
night. He quickly filled me in on what was happening, saying they weren't
sure what the problem was but that the details had been passed to the tech
people. He also asked if he could send me an email with some questions in it
that would help get to the bottom of things; he said it would ask things
like OS type and version, device type, etc. It all seemed to make sense</p>
<p>I said I'd be happy to and we left it at that.</p>
<p>I've had the email. This is what it asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Origin and Destination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gah! Here we go again. The whole support thing appears to be predicated on
the idea that you're having a problem getting somewhere. They seem to not
understand that if you can't even use the system in the first place you
can't even have booked a ticket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - Date and Time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a ticket, there can be no date and time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - Number of passengers and railcards if any</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing a pattern here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - Ticket name and price</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm... hello?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Browser name &amp; version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally! We're getting somewhere! Only... my problem isn't in a web
browser. My problem is with logging in with their Android app. I'm sure I
mentioned this to them at least once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 - Screenshot if possible showing the error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay! Finally! We're getting somewhere! I pasted in the screenshot that was
included in yesterday's blog post. You know the one. The one where it's just
some text that says the username and password are invalid. Because... images
are better than the text in them, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 -  Name of the TOC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no clue what this means. TOC? What the heck is a TOC?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8 - Email address of the user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This I can do! I know this one! (I still suspect that this is the cause of
the problem).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9 - Booking ref</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaaarrrrrggghhhhhh!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Screen shot showing exact error and exact steps to recreate the error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait... didn't I get asked that in question 6? How is this screenshot going
to be different from the other screenshot? Still, at least it asks for the
steps to recreate now. So I answered that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new account on the Virgin East Coast website. Ideally use an
   email address that contains both a full stop and a plus sign, as mine
   does. Also ensure that you use a password that is the same length as
   mine.</li>
<li>Log in and look at registered devices.</li>
<li>See there are none and follow the links it provides to the applicable app
   that will result in a device being registered. In this case the Ticket
   Wallet.</li>
<li>Download and install on a suitable Android device.</li>
<li>Attempt to log in and, likely, find that you're told that the username
   and password is incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
So that's all sent off now. Now I wait for another call back at some point
in the near future.</p>
<p>Curious how the thing it didn't ask was what app I was using, what version
it was, what mobile device it was being used on, what OS, what OS version,
etc...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This year has seen me travelling up and down the east coast of England (and
into Scotland) quite a bit. Unsurprisingly this means I've been using
<a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/">Virgin East Coast</a> a lot. While I'm
no stranger to the rail network (I grew up in York, my father worked for
what was once called British Rail, etc) I've not been a regular user since
the mid 1990s (when I used to travel from Winchester to London every day).</p>
<p>Much has changed since the last time I used the trains a lot; the big (good)
change being that you can do a ton of stuff online and, even more usefully,
you can do most things on your mobile phone. Being able to buy tickets from
my desk or sofa, and being able to carry all the useful info (times, seat
numbers, etc) inside an app makes for an almost stress-free journey.</p>
<p>Up until now I've being using <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">TheTrainLine</a>
to do all the booking. The website is uncluttered and easy to use. The same
is true of their Android app. I have no complaints at all about how their
system works.</p>
<p>But there is one small downside...</p>
<p>The journey I do takes about 4 hours so it makes sense that I settle down
and get some work done. Working, of course, requires that I have some sort
of Net connection. Ideally I'd just connect via my phone but I find that the
signal can't be relied on for large parts of the journey. But that's okay,
the trains have WiFi.</p>
<p>It's not cheap though. On Virgin, if you're not travelling first class
(something I do do if I can get the right sort of deal) you need to pay £10
to get enough WiFi time to last the trip. Not horrific, but over a few
journeys it adds up.</p>
<p>Recently though Virgin East Coast have been doing this thing where, if you
book direct via them, you get the WiFi for free. So, while I have no
complaints about TheTrainLine, it makes sense for me to book direct with
Virgin and hopefully save myself a tenner on the WiFi.</p>
<p>A couple or so weeks back I finally created an account with VEC. I did my
usual thing that I do and used a variation on my Gmail email address. You
know the sort of thing,
<a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html">make use of the fact that anything after the + in the address doesn't "count"</a>
but can be useful to filter things and keep track of who's selling on your
contact details.</p>
<p>So I registered as davep.org+virgin@gmail.com. The website accepted it
just fine.</p>
<p>The next job was to install their wallet app. According to the website this
lets you travel without even needing to faff around with printed tickets:
you can do it 100% with your phone (something TTL now do too, I believe). So
I downloaded the app, went to log in, and...</p>
<p><img alt="Login denied" src="/attachments/2016/06/17/Screenshot_20160617-152120.png"></p>
<p>I tried a few times, just to be sure that I wasn't being an idiot and
messing up but... nope, it just wasn't going to let me log in.</p>
<p>Dammit!</p>
<p>After a few more attempts I gave up and went back to using TTL. Yesterday,
however, I decided to look into this again. The problem persisted so I
logged into the VEC website, followed the links for getting help with the
site (I couldn't see help for the app) and sent a message using the form on
the website.</p>
<p>In the initial query I pointed out that I'd like to use the system to book
tickets -- especially so I could enjoy free WiFi -- but that the app
wouldn't let me log in. I asked how I might fix the problem.</p>
<p>The first reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please confirm which Mobile App you have downloaded and we will
advise you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, fair enough. I'd spoken about "the app" (although I'd only been
offered one via the site) and it seems there's more than one. So I wrote
back and confirmed I was talking about the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eastcoast.wallet">Ticket Wallet</a>.</p>
<p>They replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please provide us with your booking reference number and we will
advise you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm.... Hello? Booking reference? I smell a faint whiff of Catch-22
here.... Never mind. I write back and point out that there is no booking,
I'm asking about a problem with their app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please confirm if you have registered on the Virgin Trains East
Coast website and we will advise you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well this is getting fun. I'd been logged in and used their contact form
when I sought help. You'd think that it would record this information in
some way. Fair enough, perhaps not. So I confirm that, yes, I had created an
account with their website and was trying to use that to log in (I also
quoted a line from my original message where I'd said this, right from the
start).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have registered with us please provide us with the email address
used as the email address in the original email davep.org+virgin@gmail.com
is not recognised on our system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erm... Well this is getting silly now. That's absolutely the email address
I'd registered with and was logging in with. That's why I was trying to log
into the app with it! So I replied confirming that that was the address I'd
registered with and hence my confusion.</p>
<p>The reply? This:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can confirm Virgin Trains East Coast has two Mobile Application, the
Virgin Trains East Coast App and the Virgin Trains East Coast Live App.</p>
<p>When you purchase an eligible Virgin Trains East Coast ticket on the
website you will be offered the option of having your ticket delivered to
your mobile device as an m-ticket.</p>
<p>To use the app, simply sign in with your Virgin Trains East Coast login
details, and the app will synch with your online account. If you haven’t
registered that device before, it will ask you to name your device. That
name will then be shown in your account and when buying tickets, so you
can choose which device to send your tickets to.</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting the Virgin Trains East Coast web support team,
should you require any further assistance please don’t hesitate to contact
us on 03457 225 111.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm.... what? I'm still unsure what this was really telling me. The
words made sense, it seemed to be filled with facts, but none of this seemed
to pertain to what I was asking them. Worse still, it seemed to give the
impression that you needed to have purchased a ticket before you could
use the mobile app (at least that's one interpretation I'm getting from the
above) and yet, when you follow the links on the website, it says something
very different.</p>
<p>I replied pointing out that I was failing to see how that addressed what I'd
asked, and I reiterated my problem.</p>
<p>At this point I got a little frustrated and tweeted my frustration:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> The problem goes deeper than that. I’ve never been able to log in. Ever. Support says ac doesn’t exist. But it does.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>I'd also tweeted after my first, talking about the frustration of how TTL
seem to do things well, but I only get free WiFi if I book via Virgin:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What really bugs me: <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> offer free WiFi if book thru them, but app won’t work. <a href="https://twitter.com/thetrainline">@thetrainline</a> works brill, but no free Wifi.</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/743802438235328512">June 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p></center></p>
<p>That tweet got a reply from them asking if I was talking about the wallet
app (I was, of course) and if I'd registered with the website first. O_o</p>
<p>So, after a lot of back and forth, I'd got nowhere with this. I did, a
little while later, get an email asking for my phone number so they could
call me; I replied with it.</p>
<p>The phone call came a little later on. It didn't go well.</p>
<p>At first I was told that the problem was that I needed to purchase a ticket
and then that would mean I'd be able to log into the mobile app. Let's just
take a moment to really appreciate what's being said: I SHOULD SPEND A
HUNDRED POUNDS OR MORE SO I CAN EVEN LOG INTO THE APP.</p>
<p>Only... that's
nonsense. <a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/rail-travel/your-ticket/m-tickets/">According to the website</a>
it works very different from that. What the website implies is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You create an account on the website.</li>
<li>You download the wallet app.</li>
<li>You log into the wallet app with the username and password you use on the
   website.</li>
<li>This then registers the mobile device with the system.</li>
<li>Then, and only then, can you buy a ticket.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I pointed this out to the nice lady on the other end of the line she
seemed confused by the idea and had to go and check it. She then came back
and confirmed that, yes, that's how it works. At which point I asked her how
I was supposed to actually log in if it kept telling me my username and
password were wrong.</p>
<p>She then suggested that, yes, perhaps there was a problem and could I send a
screenshot of the wallet app so they could look into it. A screenshot. O_o</p>
<p>Sure, I guess I could send in a screenshot. You can see it above. It's quite
simply the text "Your username or password is incorrect". That's it. That's
the problem. It's nice and easy to type. It's text. It's English. I can't
see any special pixels that would help debug the issue.</p>
<p>But, nope, it needed a screenshot.</p>
<p>I asked if, perhaps, I could speak with these "technical" people who'd be
dealing with this. I was told that that wouldn't be possible and that,
instead, she'd have her manager call me. She then hung up pretty sharpish
after that.</p>
<p>Right now, as of the time of writing, I'm waiting on that call.</p>
<p>While I do wait, I'm going to make a prediction as to the cause of this. I'm
willing to bet the problem is with the choice of email address. So many
large companies have systems that assume that + isn't a valid character for
an email address. I'm going to further guess that Virgin East Coast <em>isn't</em>
one of them when it comes to their website. When it comes to their Wallet
App though...</p>
<hr>
<p>Later in the evening: I never did get a call from the woman's manager, but
an hour or so later I did get a call from someone at their "web support
team". Sadly I wasn't in a position to take it so I'm no wiser as to what
the call was actually going to be about. I'll return the call tomorrow and,
all being well, write a second post about what happened.</p>
<p>The main thing I take away from this today though is that, if you (as
appears to have happened a few times today) follow a script and don't
<em>actually</em> read what the customer is writing, it's going to turn into a very
frustrating experience; especially for the customer.</p></div>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>As I've mentioned elsewhere on this blog, over the past few years, my
use of GNU emacs has lapsed somewhat. There was a time when it was my
only editor (except for the odd dips into vim to do some quick
editing) and, back when I used to use GNU Linux as a desktop machine a
lot, I'd have an emacs session up and running pretty much non-stop (it
was one of the reasons I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/davep/uptimes.el">uptimes.el</a>).</p>
<p>In more recent times I've been working more on Windows and often
inside Visual Studio. Even for my own "for fun" programming, I've
mostly being doing things that didn't involve emacs much. In fact,
most of my recent "for fun" coding has been done using
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> because it was powerful,
cross-platform and also had great support for
<a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal">the language I code in a lot when it comes to personal amusement projects</a>.</p>
<p>During that time I've wanted to get back into emacs. Quite a bit seems
to have changed since I was last a very avid user and this also meant
wanting and needing to catch up.</p>
<p>The first thing I needed to do was finally get around to killing off
my old <code>~/.emacs</code> file. This has followed me around since I first got
into emacs on OS/2 back in the mid 1990s. The file started out with a
few <code>setq</code> expressions to tweak some settings and just kept growing
and growing. It'd got to a point where there was old stuff in there
that I had no use for and sometimes even no idea what it was
for. Heck, to give some idea of how old the file was: there were items
in there that handled running emacs on MS-DOS!</p>
<p>So, a couple of weeks back, I dumped it. Dumped the whole lot. The
plan then was to recreate it with as little hands-on coding as
possible. I decided that, as much as I could, I'd tweak using
<code>customize</code> and only hand-code (in <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> this time
around) things when there was no obvious other way to do it.</p>
<p>So far this is working out really well. Gone has the ugly and
monolithic <code>.emacs</code>, replaced with something far more modular, much
more tidy and far easier to maintain. Whereas my old config was almost
1,000 lines long, the new <code>init.el</code> is currently just 50 lines:</p>

<p>All the other stuff, things to tweak language modes so they indent

</code></pre></div>

<p>Another thing I'm trying to do is dump all the old third party code I
had locally and, instead, use emacs' own package manager
now. Currently this is also working well for me given that I'm using
both <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/">ELPA</a> and <a href="https://melpa.org/#/">MELPA</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't managed to dump everything yet, but it's a useful exercise
to slowly work through the various files I was carting around and
deciding if I need them or not (like, I'm fairly sure I won't be
needing a <code>cobol-mode</code> any time soon -- that can go).</p>
<p>On top of all of this, on top of starting with a "clean slate" emacs,
I've also started keeping track of what I do on GitHub. I've got a
private repo for my <code>~/.emacs.d/</code> that I can now easily sync between
my various machines.</p>
<p>One final thing that I'm starting to try and do is actually make full
use of emacs again. One example is that I'm writing this blog post in
it. Until now I've been using SublimeText with
<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll">a Jekyll package to compose and manage things</a>
but, this time around I'm giving <a href="https://melpa.org/#/hyde">hyde</a> and
<a href="https://melpa.org/#/markdown-mode">markdown-mode</a> a go. So far
they're working out pretty well too (albeit hyde was a bit odd to set
up and isn't 100% making sense to me yet).</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.</p>
<p>Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).</p>
<p>I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.</p>
<p>So I had to go and look.</p>
<p>Having looked I came away with one.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.</p>
<p>As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.</p>
<p>For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.</p>
<p>And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.</p></div>

      <div><p>Now and again Google seem to actually listen. While they do generally have a
bad habit of removing things from things and saying it's for everyone's good
(because options are bad and they can't maintain them, apparently) it seems
they <em>can</em> do the odd turnaround now and again.</p>
<p>One thing they removed from Android recently was the
"<a href="/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html">until next alarm</a>""
option when putting a device in "do not disturb" mode.</p>
<p>Seems they've added that back in 6.0.1:</p>
<p><img alt="Google sees sense" src="/attachments/2015/12/17/Screenshot_20151217-112015.png"></p>
<p>It's a small thing, but it makes so much more sense and makes things so much
easier (even if it's a trivial thing).</p>
<p>Nice one Google. More of this please.</p></div>

      <div><p>Until I moved about a year ago I'd always used Demon Internet as my ISP. I
stated with them during the old tenner-a-month days when there were only a
handful of points-of-presence to be called. I stuck with them through them
getting full local POP coverage, through having an ISDN line and then finally
ADSL.</p>
<p>When I moved though I decided it might be easier to just go with BT; for the
most part this hasn't actually been a bad decision. This week though I suffered
my first proper outage with them and it was rather frustrating.</p>
<p>It kicked off at around 2015-11-16 21:00. I noticed that Google Drive (in
Chrome) was complaining that it was offline. I then noticed that gmail and
a couple of other tabs in Chrome were complaining about the same thing. I
did a couple of local network checks and found nothing, checked the router and
it was connected and reporting just fine, so then I rebooted the router and
things appeared to improve.</p>
<p>For a short while anyway. Then I started to notice other problems; mostly that
some sites would time out, others not. Initially I was getting a lot of DNS
timeouts and, while I normally use Google's DNS servers (BT's have long had
lots of problems<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>), I tried switching back to BT's own and that appeared
to improve matters. For a while anyway.</p>
<p>I mentioned the issues on twitter and got a handful of replies from different
people running into similar issues. It was clear that this wasn't just me. I
then went looking for BT's broadband status page but hilariously was unable
to load it because of the problem.</p>
<p>This is my first bit of real frustration with them. Here's how the page
looks inside a desktop browser:</p>
<p><img alt="Status in desktop browser" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-18 at 10.42.40.png"></p>
<p>Now compare it as seen inside Android Chrome on my Nexus 6:</p>
<p><img alt="Status on my phone" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screenshot_20151118-104156.png"></p>
<p>Apparently they have decided that I'd never want to be able to check why my
broadband might be down, from a mobile device. Yes, sure, there's the option
to put my phone number in -- perhaps it tells me after I've done that -- but
I don't even know my land line number; I don't use it as a phone most of the
time and so never bother remembering it. The main point here is why the hell
wouldn't they include the same useful information as the desktop view? Or
perhaps use geolocation of the phone to narrow things down if they feel the
need.</p>
<p>Anyway, I gave up and went to bed. In the morning things were no better but,
after another router reboot, I did manage to get a view of the status:</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to see broadband status" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 10.29.47.png"></p>
<p>Finally! Acknowledgement of the problem. Worryingly though it was dated almost
12 hours after I first noticed the problem. From what I can see that date and
time isn't the date and time the status was last updated, it's the date and
time it was first added. That suggest that they really hadn't noticed the
problem all night. It's not like it was a problem that was hard to notice,
at least from a customer's point of view. Check this graph from a <a href="http://downdetector.co.uk/problems/bt-british-telecom">down
detector site</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="It really was down" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 10.27.07.png"></p>
<p>You'd think that a company as big as BT would have something in place that could
catch network problems, especially ones that are able to be caught with a simple
crowdsourcing "press this button if you have a problem" approach.</p>
<p>But... nope. Appears not. O_o</p>
<p>Anyway, a couple or so hours later the problem was finally fixed:</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to see broadband status" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 13.01.00.png"></p>
<p>(Notice how the date and time is the same as earlier; so 100% not an update time
but a first-added time) I mentioned this on twitter:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like BT broadband problems are resolved. Everything working that I can see, and this... <a href="https://t.co/m5Mo7vm5Yu">pic.twitter.com/m5Mo7vm5Yu</a></p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/666602185233440768">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>and I even got a reply (which I'd not gone looking for, so that was nice):</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">@davepdotorg</a> Yes Dave we have the problem fixed, if you still notice a few issues then reset the hub and try again. ^Chris</p>&mdash; BT (@BTCare) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare/status/666642010045050880">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<p>Curious as to why it'd take almost 12 hours from the problem appearing to it
being acknowledged on their status, I thought I'd ask:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare">@BTCare</a> All looking good. Any reason why it took 12 hours to acknowledge?</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/666642201783480320">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<p>which got this reply:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">@davepdotorg</a> Sorry it took so long, identifing the source of the problems would have taken some time. ^Shane</p>&mdash; BT (@BTCare) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare/status/666666833148268548">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<p>which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. Sure, you to spend time
identifying the source of a problem to <em>fix</em> it, but you don't need to do that
to notice and acknowledge that there's a problem. I've asked again but
haven't received any sort of reply as of the time of writing (I'm not expecting
one really).</p>
<p>What I take from all of this is that BT are shockingly bad at keeping people
informed of problems with their service when there's a large outage. I find
that kind of annoying. I don't mind that there are problems, I do mind when
a company can't take the time to clearly and quickly state "yup, it's us, it's
not you, we're looking into it..."</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier on today I needed a copy of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"><code>wget</code></a> on my iMac. It's not "native" to
it so I got to wondering how you go about getting something like that onto it.
Sure, I could have just grabbed the source and built myself, but really it's
a lot nicer to use some sort of package manager.</p>
<p>A quick search lead me to <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and I was then up and
running in no time.</p>
<p>This in turn got me to thinking about how it might be fun to get some of the
software I used to use on my GNU/Linux machine up and running again. The first
one that came to mind was <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/"><code>slrn</code></a>. Sure enough
slrn is available via Homebrew and installing it was dead simple.</p>
<p>But then I was faced with a problem: I needed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">NNTP</a> server.
Way back I used to run a local one in my office that fed from and to my
ISP's. Back then my ISP was Demon Internet; these days I'm with BT. A quick
search lead me to an article or two that BT had a NNTP server, of sorts,
provided by a third party. So I did a quick check:</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Yay! This looked good.</p>
<p>After that I fired up <code>slrn</code> and.... problems. It kept asking me to log in,
to provide a user name and password. The only problem was that I'd read in more
than one place that a user name and password weren't needed for BT's server;
all that was required was you be on a BT IP address. Checking the slrn docs
I found <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-manual-6.html#ss6.32"><code>force_authentication</code></a>
but ensuring that was off made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point I removed <code>slrn</code> and gave up.</p>
<p>Later, thinking it might be an issue with just <code>slrn</code> and perhaps it was worth
trying a native NNTP client, I grabbed Unison
(<a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">which is no longer supported</a>
but seems to work fine). I got that set up and ran into the same issue: it
wanted login details.</p>
<p>Finally, after a bit more digging, I stumbled on the reason why I was struggling
to make any of this work: <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51205/?s_cid=con_FURL_giganews">BT had closed support for the server back in
December last year</a>!</p>
<p>A quick search around the web and I stumbled on <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org/">Eternal September</a>.
Given all I was interested in was the good old text groups this looked perfect.
I quickly registered an account, ran up Unison again and plugged in my details
and....</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.19.17.png"></p>
<p>Now that's all sorted I should try again with <code>slrn</code>. At which point I'll need
to drag out and tidy up <code>post.el</code> (<a href="http://post-mode.sourceforge.net/">the version that was being maintained
by some other people seems to have gone very stale</a>, sadly).</p></div>

      <div><p>I actually can't remember when the change was now, it was either Android 5.0
or one of the 5.x point releases, but I can recall the frustration of Google
having changed how you make an Android device silent, or not. The idea seemed
clever enough but it was a real pain to switch to and use. Previously there'd
simply been this neat system of setting he volume to either be some non-off
value, vibrate or totally silent. I even had a neat little widget on the home
screen of my phone to allow me to toggle between these 3 states.</p>
<p>It was simple, and worked well.</p>
<p>The new system though.... ugh. It was confusing and so much more long-winded
to work with.</p>
<p>At some point though they added one big redeeming feature: "Until next alarm".
When I got into bed I could tell my tablet to go totally silent until my
alarm went off in the morning, and then it would all work as normal. That was
an utterly brilliant idea.</p>
<p>So it made sense that if they changed anything about this in Marshmallow they'd
keep that in and make it even more awesome, right? Right?!?</p>
<p><img alt="Nope" src="/attachments/2015/11/12/Screenshot_20151112-140600.png"></p>
<p>Well fuck!</p>
<p>Why? Just..... why?!? I actually prefer how the new one works. They've more or
less solved the problem of how it was more faff to deal with, they've solved
the problem of having to cock about with the volume rocker to get at the
settings and then set the settings. I like all that.</p>
<p>But taking "Until next alarm" away? That's just nuts.</p>
<p>Sometimes I really get the impression that the Android developers are like the
Chrome OS developers: they're having a ton of fun improving and onward developing
the system but they have little connection to how people actually use this stuff.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's been quite a while since I used voiced search on my Nexus 6. Ever since
I got the Moto 360 I've not really had a need to say "OK Google" to my phone
because I could simply say it to my wrist. Today though, because I wanted to
quickly look something up and my phone was to hand, I spoke to it and got this:</p>
<p><img alt="Voice search fail" src="/attachments/2015/11/11/Screenshot_20151111-154157.png"></p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've been here before. I had <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/fP9kdADZPQ9">exactly this sort of problem with my Xperia Z
at one point</a>.
The problem appeared to go away eventually (actually, it sort of came and
went a few times over a matter of weeks, if I recall correctly), although I
never really got to the bottom of the cause.</p>
<p>I've tried rebooting the phone and that hasn't helped at all. While it's more
of a vague annoyance than anything else (like I say above, my Android Wear
device is my goto tool for talking to Google these days) it does frustrate a
little when fairly expensive tools don't "just work".</p></div>
