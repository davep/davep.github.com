my first show booked for this year's Edinburgh Fringe was to see &lt;a href="https://harperspace.com/home"&gt;Nick
Harper&lt;/a&gt;. It's been a long time since I've seen
him; far too long. As best as I can tell the last gig I made it to was in
2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen years. Shit's changed in that time, for me, for the world. O_o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first getting into town it was warm and crowded, with that fun "town is
doing festival shit" vibe that I like, so I went and grabbed an ice cream to
kill some time until the venue opened. I knew I was in the right spot when,
as I stood on Chambers Street, enjoying the cooldown, the man himself dashed
passed, guitar case in hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got into the venue I grabbed a drink and tried to find a seat; most
were taken; except for one right at the front and off to the side. So I
grabbed it. Moments later Nick himself came over to say hello to the folk
sat in this spot. We had a wee chat about how long it was since I'd last
seen him, nattered about general stuff, and he said very nice things about
my hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2682.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gig itself was fantastic. While I love his recorded work anyway, Nick's
always been one of those artists who I enjoy most live. He's got this way of
singing and playing guitar that fills whatever time he's got to play; never
once have I ever found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it's near
the end; or if I have it's because I'm worried it'll be over soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2684.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good number of the tracks he played I didn't recognise; at least two of
them I know are from a new album that's coming, and I have to admit that
when I do listen to his stuff it's the earlier works that tend to go into
heavy rotation (I think the last album of his I bought was &lt;em&gt;The Last
Guitar&lt;/em&gt;). But I loved everything I got to hear. I'll be diving back into
&lt;a href="https://harperspace.com/shop"&gt;his catalogue&lt;/a&gt; and also keeping an eye out
for the new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2689.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was only an hour for his slot, he did manage to get a couple of
old favourites of mine in; I was delighted when he launched into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQAebSpqVw"&gt;By My
Rocket Comes Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and even
squeezed in a quick &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yz7mQ_i6pg"&gt;Galaxy
Song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2705.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too quickly though, the hour was up. It was kind of fitting that many of
the songs he did have on the set list were all about time (on purpose, I'm
sure). I'm happy to say I got to say a quick thank you and goodbye and then
it was time for me to head out of town again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2701.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Nick brought back a lot of good memories, and reminded me that I need
to catch up on his more recent works. While most of his stuff doesn't seem
to be on Apple Music (what can I say, I'm very online these days when it
comes to music), I'm glad to see &lt;a href="https://nickharper.bandcamp.com/"&gt;he's got a full
Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll be paying that a visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope he swings back this way some time soon, not during the Fringe, and
with a proper long set. It's been too long since I got to enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTD03-3qgmg"&gt;him really
going for it and having a ton of
fun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 08:15:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-12:/2023/08/12/nick-harper-at-the-jazz-bar.html</guid><category>Life</category><category>Music</category><category>Gig</category><category>Fringe</category><category>Nick Harper</category></item><item><title>The HomePod fixed itself</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/12/the-homepod-fixed-itself.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html#home-pod-stuck-installing"&gt;A couple of weeks
back&lt;/a&gt;
I mentioned home my main HomePod had got stuck installing 16.6 of the
software that runs it. This situation persisted for days after writing that
post and I kept promising myself that I was going to see if I could unstick
it by removing it from the Home, doing a factory reset and adding it back
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, during the week that followed, I never got round to that. You can
imagine what it's like: no time in the morning, and by the time I get home
in the evening I want to watch TV and use the HomePod as the speaker for the
Apple TV, I don't want to be doing tech support shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following weekend... yeah, I kinda forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, a couple of Saturdays on, it's early morning, I've had
breakfast and I'm having coffee and I think it's the perfect time to do
this. I hope the Home app my on iPad and... it's sorted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HomePod all good again" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 07.25.44.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, it looks like it somehow managed to unstick itself in the end. A
quick test of some of the issues I was seeing suggested there was still an
issue, for example asking for the temperature in the bedroom would still
result in a &lt;em&gt;"working on it"&lt;/em&gt; reply followed by it telling me it wasn't
responding. A quick reset seems to have fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it's good to know: if it happens again, it'll keep on working as the
speaker for my Apple TV, and it'll eventually sort itself out even if I
don't muck about with a hard reset.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 07:46:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-12:/2023/08/12/the-homepod-fixed-itself.html</guid><category>Tech</category><category>Apple</category></item><item><title>The reboot begins</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;And I'm off! This morning I spent a good amount of time going through the
sources for the old version of &lt;a href="http://www.davep.org"&gt;&lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
removing everything that won't be needed any more, and also building up a
rough TODO list of things I may want to recreate as content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done, &lt;a href="/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html"&gt;as mentioned earlier
today&lt;/a&gt;, I started work on
building the site around Pelican. Pretty quickly though I started to feel
that that was going to be a bad choice. While Pelican felt like a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;
fit for this blog -- mainly because it seems to be very blog-oriented -- it
was feeling a bit clunky for a general website that would have a handful of
static pages at best; likely something I wouldn't be updating too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put it aside and went on with my morning, doing normal Friday domestic
stuff like the weekly supermarket shop. It was while I was out doing that
that I realised the obvious answer: use &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/"&gt;what we use for the Textual
docs&lt;/a&gt; and what's been used for
&lt;a href="https://label.dev/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;label.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/"&gt;Material for
MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just spent about 40 minutes after lunch kicking that off and it was
really straightforward. Of course the result is horrifically cookie-cutter
in terms of its look -- such is the way that &lt;code&gt;mkdocs-material&lt;/code&gt; sites end up
looking out of the box -- but I don't much care about that; what's important
is that I've got a placeholder page in place, and I've quickly built a
framework for writing and publishing the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the plan: now that the welcome page is in place and there's
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on my domain that looks like a working website again I can start
to slowly drag in old content in a new format. Heck, if I'm careful I might
even be able to retain some of the old URLs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer-term plans might involve finally sorting out &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; support (yes,
even today, my site is &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;-only), and perhaps adding some sort of RSS
feed so there's a record of when changes are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that... hopefully that'll be about it and perhaps the website will
last another 22 years running on top of the same engine (actually that part
should be easier because the "engine" is now local and it generates a static
site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes who'll last longer, the site or me?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 13:19:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-11:/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html</guid><category>Coding</category><category>html</category><category>web</category></item><item><title>Admitting defeat on my website</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've had &lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt; since very late 1999. Initially it started as a domain
used just for email; while I did have a website, around that time it was
still hosted on my then-ISPs hosting service, with a mirror on a friend's
web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so later I finally did a proper revamp of my website and finally
settled on &lt;code&gt;www.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; as the place to point people to. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;, when
I made that move, that's when I decided to write my own website engine in
php. It was fun. It worked. I didn't want to code backend stuff (I don't
think the backend vs frontend distinction was even a thing we were talking
about then) so hacking it together in an unholy mix of ruby to generate
various static files that live in the filesystem and then php to turn them
into actual HTML made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The earliest version of davep.org I can find" src="/attachments/2023/08/11/davep-org.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heavily maintained the site for many years; keeping the same engine,
tweaking the styles, adding features and content. I figure some time around
2013 or 2014 I probably stopped being quite so active in messing with it,
and then in the last 5 or 6 years I've pretty much neglected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neglect shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... php has changed. Quiet a lot. It's one of those languages I
used back in the day and pay no attention to. Then earlier this week I
noticed that there must have been an update on the host and huge parts of my
site broke, lots of content missing, pretty much useless and dead in the
water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did briefly think about breaking out the latest and greatest php locally,
setting things up to investigate what's going on, and seeing if I could
breathe some more life into it; but really what's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all these years I'm finally admitting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, on the home page, I've just got a placeholder saying that bitrot
finally ate my website and that I'm going to start again from scratch.
That's my plan: given that &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html"&gt;I had a good experience moving this blog over to
Pelican&lt;/a&gt; I
think I'm going to build a new &lt;code&gt;www.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; with Pelican. Where possible
I'll try and drag some of the old content over, but I'm also going to use
this opportunity to have a proper digital spring clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no planned timescale for this, but this morning I've spent an hour
or so over coffee, branching the repo for the site and pruning out all the
stuff I know I won't need and don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try and drop the odd update in here as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 08:44:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-11:/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html</guid><category>Coding</category><category>php</category><category>html</category><category>web</category></item><item><title>Off to see Little Shop of Horrors</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)"&gt;Little Shop of
Horrors&lt;/a&gt; for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Poser for Little Shop of Horrors" src="/attachments/2023/08/10/IMG_2652.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in &lt;a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html"&gt;a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would&lt;/a&gt;, this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; how much there is on offer?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors"&gt;a performance of Little Shop of
Horrors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 20:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-10:/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html</guid><category>Life</category><category>Music</category><category>Gig</category><category>Fringe</category></item><item><title>I turned it off and on again</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/10/i-turned-it-off-and-on-again.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from &lt;a href="/2023/08/08/strange-obsidian-sync-issue.html"&gt;the previous
entry&lt;/a&gt;, where I outlined a
weird problem I'd started having with syncing Obsidian via iCloud, I finally
decided to sit down and try and work out the exact flow of the problem.
Today, for example, I'd created an entry in two different vaults on my phone
while on the bus into work, and when I got to my desk the vault I use on my
work machine had updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I got home this evening, the vault for my personal stuff
hadn't updated on my home Mac Mini. I tried a few edits, in both vaults, on
the iPhone, and nothing came through to the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... before I started really diving into things I decided to &lt;em&gt;"turn it off
and on again"&lt;/em&gt; -- the iPhone that is -- and when it came back I ran up
Obsidian, which told me it wasn't allowed to access my iCloud drive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a moment to go into the settings to try and figure it out, didn't
find what I wanted right away, then got to thinking that perhaps some of the
phone's services were still spinning up, so I ran Obsidian up again (after
killing it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, this time, it saw my vaults. With both vaults open on my Mac I
made edits to open entries and &lt;strong&gt;the edits started to flow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yup, looks like it was a simple case of &lt;em&gt;"turn it off and on again"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple: &lt;code&gt;#ItJustWorks&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 18:17:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-10:/2023/08/10/i-turned-it-off-and-on-again.html</guid><category>Tech</category><category>Obsidian</category><category>Apple</category><category>iCloud</category><category>iPhone</category><category>Mac</category></item><item><title>Strange Obsidian sync issue</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/08/strange-obsidian-sync-issue.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Since October last year I've been getting into using
&lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Not that heavily, not to the extent some
people do, but just as a way to keep a daily journal of work-related things.
Each day at &lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/"&gt;Textual HQ&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/about-us/"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; finish off with a chat about how
our day has gone, stuff we're wondering about, etc, etc... So I don't lose
tack of what I've been up to I keep notes and Obsidian is how I do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really like about it is how I can have iPhone, iPad and
macOS versions on the go and have it all sync via iCloud. It generally works
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the last couple of days I've noted the oddest problem, and I've yet
to pin down the exact flow. But it seems to be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I create or edit a note on my iPhone, it doesn't turn up on my Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I create or edit a note on my Mac, it turns up on my iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I might have seen variations on that theme but I've not made
careful note -- normally I'm made aware of it when I'm trying to get
something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's super weird is this: on the iPhone, if I create a note, and then go
into the &lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt; app and look at the iCloud folders for Obsidian, the file
isn't there! It's there in Obsidian itself, I can move it about, edit it,
etc, etc... but it's not in the "vault" as seen from the &lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the last part that has be really puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get to the bottom of this I'll try and remember to write up what I
find. I suspect I'm going to need some proper clear time, without other
distractions, and experiment with all the edit and sync options and see what
works and what fails.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 20:55:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-08:/2023/08/08/strange-obsidian-sync-issue.html</guid><category>Tech</category><category>Obsidian</category><category>Apple</category><category>iCloud</category><category>iPhone</category><category>Mac</category></item><item><title>Off to see Nick Harper</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Poaster from likely the last time I saw Nick" src="/attachments/2023/08/07/2009-05-08-19-14-07.jpg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside
form the odd show here and there, I've never really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; the Fringe. As
in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn't quite
allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every
year I've been up here I've managed one show, at least, but this year I want
to try and make myself get to a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one per week. Possibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might not happen, but I'm going to try. What can I say? I don't live &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;
Edinburgh, I'm not a big "be out amongst people" kind of person, and the
activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little
part of Scotland is a constant battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year I'm going to try my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening I've booked a ticket for an artist I've been a fan of since the
1990s: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harper"&gt;Nick Harper&lt;/a&gt;. I saw Nick
quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; 2009 might be
the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat
(again, life stuff). So seeing that &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/5-nights-in-harperspace"&gt;he's playing here for a few
days&lt;/a&gt; was
something I could not ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something
kinda sociable. I'm sure he'll be mad at me most of the day it's happening,
but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he'll be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, at this moment... I'm rather looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 21:56:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-07:/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html</guid><category>Life</category><category>Music</category><category>Gig</category><category>Fringe</category><category>Nick Harper</category></item><item><title>HomePod Stuck Installing Update</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have three HomePods. I have a Mini in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.
I then have one of the newer-gen "big" HomePods in the living room, which
amongst other things is the speaker for my Apple TV device (yeah, I'm kinda
Apple all over the place these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week there was an update to the software, updating to 16.6. The two
Minis updated just fine. The big one, however, days later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HomePod stuck installing the update" src="/attachments/2023/07/29/HomePodStuck.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been like this all the time since the update turned up. I've tried a
reboot from the Home app. I've tried pulling the plug and plugging it in
again. Nope. It just keeps sitting there like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... it's working (more or less) fine. It's still playing music.
It's still being the speaker for the Apple TV. It still answers most
questions and performs most commands (most of the commands I give it are to
add stuff to my Reminders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasion if I ask it questions about other devices in the apartment
(&lt;em&gt;"hey siri, what's the temperature in the bedroom?"&lt;/em&gt;) it'll do the
&lt;em&gt;"working on it"&lt;/em&gt; thing and then give up saying the thing wasn't responding.
That seems to be about the worst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having checked this online it looks like, annoyingly, the one option I have
left is to do a full reset, removing it from my Home, doing a factory reset,
and then setting it up again. I'm sure it's something that'll take 10
minutes or so; but it's an annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple: &lt;code&gt;#ItJustWorks&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 07:56:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-29:/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html</guid><category>Tech</category><category>Apple</category></item><item><title>Quiche Reader</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/27/quiche-reader.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I can't quite remember &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; I found this this week, I think it might have
been via a comment on some article on the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news"&gt;orange
site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I stumbled on a really
handy bit of free (as in beer) software called &lt;a href="https://quiche.works/reader/"&gt;Quiche
Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really simple and I feel &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the sort of thing I need. Over the
years I've tried all sorts of "save to read later" tools and systems; be it
things like Pocket, or tools now built into the browser these days, even
adding URLs to &lt;a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt; (back
when I used that) or (these days) Apple Reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever quite stuck. Normally I'd end up slapping stuff to read into
these systems and then never reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiche Reader, so far, feels like the perfect approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quiche Reader in action" src="/attachments/2023/07/27/quiche-reader.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple: if I see something I want to read a bit later I save it
into the application (which will sync to my other devices via iCloud). Then,
when I go to Quiche Reader, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to read the article or delete it and
move on. This is sort of what I'd do anyway, saving stuff up for months on
end until one day I'd declare saved reading bankruptcy and then start the
whole cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can look at the saved article stack and I'm forced to either read the
thing, or be honest with myself that if I'm not gonna read it now, I'm
probably never going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does have a "pause" facility (or something like that, I forget the name)
where you can throw an article to the back of the queue; but even then that
means it'll keep popping back to the top again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll see how it goes; but so far I feel like this is the best &lt;em&gt;"I'll save
this to read later"&lt;/em&gt; tool I've found yet.&lt;/p&gt;

know that, starting January 1st that year, I set about losing weight. At the
time I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; overweight and wanted to get into some sort of healthy
state. By August that year I'd managed to drop 30kg and hit and then went a
wee way under my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I'm back up a wee bit. Not much: generally about 5kg or so above
that goal, most of that having turned up on the last 7 or 8 months (not
exactly coincidental that it's happened in conjunction with the new job, the
new work location, and the new commute). While it's no real cause for
concern -- I'm still generally careful and still get plenty of exercise
(normally walk around 35km a week, run 20km, get my 10k steps in every day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week back I decided that it was time to give myself a bit of
breathing room, to try and at least drop a couple or kg; so with that in
mind I set a lower daily calorie goal in my tacking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording my weight first thing this morning (yes, I'm one of those
people who records it every day and have for a few years -- it makes for
interesting data!), this is what my calorie/stats tracker had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of my calorie and weight tracking app" src="/attachments/2023/07/21/IMG_2475.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it's putting a positive spin in things? (for the record, I'm 5.3kg
&lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; my absolute goal).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 08:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-21:/2023/07/21/encouragement-i-guess.html</guid><category>Life</category><category>UI</category><category>UX</category><category>health</category><category>fitness</category></item><item><title>textual-canvas v0.2.0</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/16/textual-canvas-0-2-0.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Demo of textual-canvas" src="/attachments/2023/07/16/textual-canvas.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that for a good chunk of this year I've been a bit lax about writing
here, there's a couple or so coding projects I've not written about (well,
not on &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; anyway -- I have spoken lots about them &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep"&gt;over on
Fosstodon&lt;/a&gt;). One such project is
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-canvas/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-canvas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name might suggest, it's a "canvas" for Textual applications, which
provides a pretty basic interface for drawing pixels, lines and circles --
and of course any other shape you are able to build up from those basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/releases/tag/v0.2.0"&gt;released a quick
update&lt;/a&gt; after
it was &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/discussions/1"&gt;requested that I add a &lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt; method to the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt;
widget&lt;/a&gt;; a request
that makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-16:/2023/07/16/textual-canvas-0-2-0.html</guid><category>Python</category><category>Python</category><category>Textual</category><category>coding</category><category>PyPi</category></item><item><title>Cmd-Tab switcher on all screens</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/14/cmd-tab-switcher-on-all-screens.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week, on Monday gone in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; moved
office. We've now got a bigger space and, as part of that, bigger desks.
Somewhat (but not entirely) coincidentally the work desk will also convert
into a standing desk&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Also also... I inherited a second screen for the
desk too. Ever since the days of CRTs and video cards that supported it,
I've been a fan of having at least a couple of screens in front of me, and
now at my work desk I've got 3 (two external displays and the display of the
MacBook Pro itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caused a slight problem though: horizontally there's quite the spread
of things to look at. This is fine, mostly I'm looking at the screen that's
in front of me; the MacBook is to the left and the "second" screen is to the
right, both with "other" stuff on them. In front of me is Emacs and my
browser, which I flip between lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is this: the MacBook needs to go to the left (because of
physical layout), which means that despite me setting the screen in front of
me as the "main" screen, the &lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; display (you know
the thing: when you hit &lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; you see the icons of
all your active applications) appears on the left-most display, which is the
MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not great. If I'm looking at the right-most display, and want to switch
using the keyboard, I've got to look over to the left, as a worst case. That
makes for a lot of unnecessary head-swivelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick Google later and &lt;em&gt;Today I Learnt&lt;/em&gt; that the following pretty much
solves the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;defaults&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;write&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;com.apple.Dock&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;appswitcher-all-displays&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-bool&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;killall&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Dock
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name of the setting would suggest: once done, the switcher appears on
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the work one is manual hand-cranked, not electronic
button-push goodness like &lt;a href="2023/07/08/new-desk.html"&gt;my new one at
home&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:56:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-14:/2023/07/14/cmd-tab-switcher-on-all-screens.html</guid><category>TIL</category><category>Apple</category><category>Mac</category><category>macOS</category><category>Work</category></item><item><title>Dot Files</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/11/dot-files.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While I'm still &lt;a href="/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html"&gt;in blog-tinkering
mode&lt;/a&gt; (long may it last!), I
thought it might be handy to keep a page kicking around that has links to
the small collection of "dot file" repositories I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I keep these in a central location (in my case &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep"&gt;up on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) so that I can very quickly spin up a
familiar work environment on a new machine (new machines are something that
doesn't happen &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; often, but it's always good to be able to get going
quickly when it does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, depending on browser type/size, either above here or off to the side,
there should now be a permanent link to &lt;a href="/pages/dot-files.html"&gt;a page of links to those
repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I look at it now it's actually surprising to me how much of my
"comfortable" environment is encapsulated in so few tools, and configured
with so few collections of files. There are other tools I use a lot too, but
most of them either have their own sync systems, or they have so few
configuration options (and are likely in a format that isn't easy to
grab/store) that it's not worth the bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like a good thing, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that's not amongst all of this, partly because it's not that
interesting, but also partly because the repository is private, is a single
bash script called &lt;code&gt;myenv&lt;/code&gt;. On a new machine, once I've got enough of a
setup that I can clone from GitHub, I drag this down and run the script and
most of the rest of the environment follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite satisfying when I need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 20:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-11:/2023/07/11/dot-files.html</guid><category>Meta</category><category>Blogging</category></item><item><title>New desk</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/08/new-desk.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I moved into my current place back in August 2019, bringing with me a fairly
small desk. Originally, many years back, I'd had a pretty big office with
&lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of office space but, upon moving up to Scotland back in 2016, I
needed to go with something a lot smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which was perfectly fine. Me and that desk wrote a lot of code. Me and that
desk &lt;a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html"&gt;transitioned from one job to
another&lt;/a&gt;, and then
&lt;a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;. Me and that desk made
it through the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a good desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was small. I'm in a place where I could spread out a fair bit again,
but I also kept putting it off and putting it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I decided that it was high time I actually upgraded; I
also promised the desk to someone else who I know will get a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of good
use out of it; so finally earlier this week I put in the order for something
bigger and fancier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, with the help of a very good friend (thanks Mariëlle!), I got the
desk built and roughly in place, and then today I've been putting the
desktop back together and adding extra bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My new desk" src="/attachments/2023/07/08/new-desk.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so nice to have more space to spread out, it's also nice to have a
black desk again! (the last one was white because... reasons) But what's
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; exciting is that it transforms into a standing desk at the touch of
a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying it in the standing configuration today and, while I doubt I
could do a whole day of coding with it like that, I'm already really liking
it as a way of breaking up the time at the keyboard. On the days I work from
home, or the days of my own where I get sucked into a personal project, I
can absolutely see me swapping between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that's left now is to get used to it. The screens are ever so slightly
further away, the height is ever so slightly different (although I can
adjust it, of course, but what I've done is adjust the sitting position to a
nicer one and that's going to take some getting used to), my iPad and Stream
Desk are in just a slightly different location, etc, etc... So I'm sure
there'll be a few days of sitting here and making small tweaks to the spot
where things live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I know it I'll be used to it. It'll be "my spot".&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 17:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-08:/2023/07/08/new-desk.html</guid><category>Life</category><category>Life</category><category>desk</category></item><item><title>Dark Waters</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/06/dark-waters.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;More than ever I'm listening to music while I work. Despite having grown up
in the 80s, and so having a good vinyl collection, and then having got into
buying all the CDs in the 90s and 00s, these days I have managed to embrace
the "just stream all the things" approach. After a long time using Spotify I
finally ended up migrating to Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I do find Apple Music does well is the whole "you seem to
like this, have you tried this?" thing; which on occasion has resulted in a
pretty neat rabbit hole of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year this happened with &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/109709660400107128"&gt;female-fronted Dutch goth/rock type
bands&lt;/a&gt;. I don't even
remember how that happened, but it's a thing that happened and I gleefully
dived right in. I came away with a few names I didn't know before, but one
album has really stuck in my head and, now that we're just over 1/2 way
through the year, I feel it's the one that gets played more than anything
else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Delain Dark Waters" src="/attachments/2023/07/06/Delain Dark Waters.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This keeps creeping back to the top of things I'm playing; sometimes when
I'm in "bang on the keyboard lots" coding mode (you know the sort of coding
mode: where you don't have to think too much because you have a good plan
for what you're doing, but you've got a lot of tapping away to do), plus
also often while I'm in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't be the least bit surprised to find that this ends up being my
most-played album this year. According to last.fm it's at the top of the
albums I've played (in places where I have scrobbling set up) in the last
365 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My last 365 days of albums on last.fm" src="/attachments/2023/07/06/AlbumsInLast365Days.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:36:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-06:/2023/07/06/dark-waters.html</guid><category>Music</category><category>Music</category></item><item><title>The switch has been made</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn't take as long as I expected it to. Just &lt;a href="/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html#considering-pelican"&gt;yesterday
morning&lt;/a&gt; I was
giving &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; a look over as a possible engine
for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while
now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I
liked it and wondered how long it would take me to make the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the evening I was making a proper effort to get the switchover started,
and just a wee while earlier, before writing this post, the switch was made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of making the switch was roughly this (and keep in mind I'm
coming from using Jekyll):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made a branch in the repo to work in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed all of the Jekyll-oriented files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decided to set up Pelican and related tools in a virtual environment,
   managed using &lt;code&gt;pipenv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ran &lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; to kick things off and give me a framework to
   start with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renamed the old &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory to &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kept tweaking the hell out of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/blob/main/pelicanconf.py"&gt;Pelican config
   file&lt;/a&gt;
   until it started to look "just so" (this is a process that has been
   ongoing, and doubtless will keep happening for some time to come).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried out a few themes and settled on
   &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex"&gt;Flex&lt;/a&gt;; while not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;
   what I wanted, it was close enough to help keep me motivated (while
   rolling my own theme from scratch would seem fun, I just know it would
   mean the work would never get done, or at least finished).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a mass tidy up of all the tags in all the posts; something I'd never
   really paid too much attention to as the Jekyll-based blog never actually
   allowed for following tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went though all the posts and removed double quotes from a lot of the
   titles in the frontmatter (something Jekyll seems to have stripped, but
   which Pelican doesn't).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweaked the &lt;code&gt;FILE_METADATA&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that the slugs for the URLs came
    from the filenames -- by default Pelican seems to slugify the title of a
    post and this meant that some of the URLs were changing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I probably spent 6 or 7 hours on making the move; a lot of that
involving reading up on how to configure Pelican and researching themes. The
rest of it was a lot of repetitive work to fix or tidy things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; most important aspect of this was keeping the post URLs the same all
the way back to the first post; as best as I can tell I've managed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I'm pleased with the result. I'm going to live with the look/theme
for a wee while and see how it sits for me. I'm sure I'll tweak it a bit as
time goes on, but at the moment I'm comfortable with how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 17:56:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-05:/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html</guid><category>Meta</category><category>Python</category><category>Blogging</category></item><item><title>Considering Pelican</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Since getting my blog editing environment set up on the "new" machine &lt;a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html"&gt;a
couple of days back&lt;/a&gt; I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog &lt;a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html"&gt;back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912"&gt;mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new&lt;/a&gt;, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that looks promising so far is &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web"&gt;using the library when kicking
  off &lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS feed generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax-highlighted code blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got off to a good start with an easy install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pelican[markdown]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then used the &lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rough
version of my blog up and going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a base theme that's to my taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Disqus working it so that any old comments remain in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get my image/attachment layout back in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.
;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting this up a couple of days back, I had to pin some packages
for the blog to older versions because of Ruby version issues; I'm sure
that Ruby has virtual environment solutions akin to Python, but diving
into that just for one tool... nah.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 08:32:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-04:/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html</guid><category>Meta</category><category>Python</category><category>Blogging</category></item><item><title>A new GitHub profile README</title><link>https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/03/making-my-github-banner.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My new GitHub banner" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/davep/main/davep.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since GitHub introduced the &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme"&gt;profile
README&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I've had a massively low-effort one in place. I made the repo, quickly wrote
the file, and then sort of forgot about it. Well, I didn't so much forget as
just keep looking at it and thinking "I should do something better with that
one day".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, while there are lots of fancy approaches out there, and lots of
neat generator tools and the like... they just weren't for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then yesterday, over my second morning coffee, after &lt;a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html"&gt;getting my blog
environment up and going again&lt;/a&gt;, I had an
idea. It could be cool to use &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.save_screenshot"&gt;Textual's screenshot
facility&lt;/a&gt;
to make something terminal-themed! I mean, while it's not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; I am these
days, so much of what I'm doing right now is aimed at the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... what to do? Then I thought it could be cool to knock up some sort of
login screen type thing; with a banner. One visit to an online large
terminal text generator site later, I had some banner text. All that was
left was to write &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/davep/blob/main/make_banner.py"&gt;a simple Textual application to create the
"screen"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main layout is simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ComposeResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;banner&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PRATTLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;github.com/davep login: [reverse] [/]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;NAME&lt;/code&gt; contains the banner and &lt;code&gt;PRATTLE&lt;/code&gt; contains the "login message".
With some &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/CSS/"&gt;Textual CSS&lt;/a&gt; sprinkled
over it to give the exact layout and colour I wanted, all that was left was
to make the snapshot. This was easy enough too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the whole thing isn't fully documented just yet, Textual does have &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.run_test"&gt;a
great tool for automatically running an application and interacting with
it&lt;/a&gt;; that
meant I could easily write a function to load up my app and save the
screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;make_banner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GitHubBannerApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pilot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;pilot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save_screenshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;davep.svg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that needs running async, but that's simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;make_banner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw in a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; so I don't forget what I'm supposed to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;.PHONY:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;all:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;pipenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;make_banner.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that's it! Job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here onward I guess I could have some real fun with this. It would be
simple enough I guess to modify the code so that it changes what's displayed
over time; perhaps show a "last login" value that relates to recently
activity or something; any number of things; and then run it in a cron job
and update the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though... I'll stick with keeping things nice and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually kind of annoying when they introduced it because the
repo it uses is named after your user name. I already had a &lt;code&gt;davep&lt;/code&gt;
repo: it was a private repo where I was slowly working on a (now
abandoned, I'll start it again some day I'm sure) ground-up rewrite of
my &lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt; website.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I did it again. I looked away for a moment and somehow
&lt;a href="/2022/12/16/oidia.html"&gt;almost 7 months passed without a post&lt;/a&gt;! It's so
easily done too isn't it? While, &lt;a href="/2022/05/20/im-back.html"&gt;when I revived this blog last
year&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't make a point of intending to write
lots and often, I had hope that I'd manage something at least once a week;
perhaps at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been two main reasons why it's been quiet around here. The first is
that &lt;a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html"&gt;my (now not so) new job&lt;/a&gt;
keeps me busy (in a good way). It involves a reasonable amount of trekking
into town and back (which I don't mind on the whole), and once I'm home in
the evening I'm generally (but not always) done with the keyboard and desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason, which is probably the dafter one, is that a bit earlier
this year I finally upgraded my desktop setup from the 2019 Intel MacBook
Pro I was using to a recently-released M2Pro Mac Mini (and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; an
upgrade!). How this plays into blogging being even more quiet is... I needed
to set up jekyll again, and I'd forgotten how I got it running in the first
place, so I kept putting off getting it going, and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning, I sat down with coffee, grepped the &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; on my
previous machine, and got it running in like 5 minutes (of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, back adding another blog post. I'm writing this as much to
test that the setup works as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, this time, I'm going to try and make a promise to myself: I'm
going to try and write more. I can and should write about anything. I can
and should write short things as well as long things. I can and should
remember that it's not about writing things that are going to be super
important or anything like that, it's about just getting stuff down and
creating and recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note of course I said "try" and make a promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave Pearson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-02:/2023/07/02/catching-up.html</guid><category>Meta</category><category>Mac</category><category>Apple</category></item></channel></rss>
