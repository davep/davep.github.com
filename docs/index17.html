  <div>
      <div><p>Last night, before heading for bed, I noticed that there was an update available
for OS X on the iMac, and also for iTunes. Despite the late hour I decided
to do the update anyway. OS X updated pretty smoothly (albeit with some rather
unhelpful progress bars that appear to give estimated times that have no
relation to reality), as did iTunes.</p>
<p>I was then told that there was an update for my iPod as well (all part of this
new thing where Apple have invented Spotify, obviously). I let that start doing
its thing and that's where things got odd. First it started the update and the
iPod appeared to insist that it wasn't plugged into the iMac, even though it
was. Then I gave it a second go (after unplugging it and plugging it in
again) and it all seemed to go through just fine, only...</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iPod?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Photo 01-07-2015 10 21 56.png"></p>
<p>...while the iPod was pretty sure it was now running iOS 8.4, iTunes on the iMac
had other ideas:</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.22.16.png"></p>
<p>The following morning iTunes kept insisting that it needed to do the update
so, even though the iPod was obviously up to date, I let it do it anyway. After
it'd gone through the update process again it still insisted that the iPod
was running 8.3 rather than 8.4. Until, that is, I unplgged it and plugged it
back in again.</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.26.20.png"></p>
<p>So now it all seems fine. I just had to do a variation on "have you tried
turning it off and on again?"</p>
<p>Once again I find myself running into things on a Mac that are very common
elsewhere, on other operating systems, and which Mac owners would often have
you believe weren't an issue.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>My history with computers starts with a Sinclair ZX81 in the early 1980s,
followed shortly by a Vic20, then on to the BBC B and fairly quickly on to
very early IBM PC compatible machines. In the early 1990s I added OS/2 (during
the introduction of Warp) and not too long after that GNU/Linux. Along the way
I've also used the odd Unix here and there as well as CP/M, RSTS and VMS.</p>
<p>Aside from an inherited Mac whose model name escapes me, and whose operating
system version also escapes me, I've never really had too much exposure to
the world of Apple.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back all of that changed.</p>
<p>It's quite a long time since I had a Unix of some form as a desktop machine
and I was starting to get the urge to have one again. During all of this time
I've had a GNU/Linux box or two available but for the past few years I've
always used them from the (dis)comfort of my Windows desktop. Generally that
was fine because the uses I had were not desktop.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short: I started out thinking that I wanted some form of
Unix on my desk again and, somehow, ended up walking out of a shop with
an iMac.</p>
<p>Given the above history I thought it might be fun to jot down my experiences
in the first couple of weeks. This will be a vaguely random wander through my
experiences. It's not a review. It's not even really intended as a judgement
of the machine and the operating system. It's nothing more than a collection
of notes of what I found and my reaction to what I found.</p>
<h1>The keyboard</h1>
<p>The first strong reaction I had to the machine was regarding the keyboard. I
thought I was going to hate it. I've had the misfortune of using various
chiclet keyboards over the years and I've hated every single one. I find that I
can't type on them, that it doesn't feel right, and that it makes my fingers
ache badly if I spend too much time using them. My history and experiences
has always been such that I've generally preferred very mechanical-feeling
keyboards.</p>
<p>This just wasn't the case with the iMac keyboard. I don't know why, I still
don't know why, but this feels like one of the most comfortable keyboards
I've ever typed on. Despite the keys being chiclet style they move in a very
positive way that really surprised me. It doesn't hurt to type, at all, and
I'm finding I can type faster on this keyboard than any other I've typed on
before.</p>
<p>There is a flipside though. I find the whole design far too cramped. Even now,
a couple of weeks later, as I type this on it, I wish the keys were just a little
bigger and just a little more spaced out. I'm adjusting, of course -- much of
this is about muscle memory -- but it does mean that it's in a constant fight
with my "knowledge" of my other main keyboards.</p>
<p>And then there's the keys that it lacks.</p>
<p>I'm still finding that this is a terrible keyboard for a programmer. For one
thing, here on the UK version of the keyboard, there's no # key. At least,
there's no simple, comfortable, direct access to the # key. Any time I want
to type a # I have to shift my left hand to find the (I think it's called
the) option key and hit 3. Shift 3 is £. And it gets even worse. This setup
doesn't work at all in GNU emacs so I then have to put the keyboard in
Australian mode so I can use shift-3 to get a #.</p>
<p>Why there isn't a proper # key is beyond me.</p>
<p>And then there's the (on the version that came with this iMac) complete lack
of page keys as well as home and end. Overall this makes the whole keyboard
feel very unfriendly to programmers and also to writers in general.</p>
<p>This, of course, is my bias and muscle memory from PCs showing. I'm still not
convinced that that bias and muscle memory is wrong.</p>
<h1>The mouse</h1>
<p>When I first started with it I hated the mouse. I should be fair and point out
that, overall, I hate mice anyway. For a good 20 years I've thrown away every
mouse I've ever had turn up with a machine and have made use of a trackball
instead. I find that a trackball gives me far more control and is far more
comfortable. So, initially, I put the Apple mouse to one side and plugged
in a trackball instead.</p>
<p>For reasons I forget now I found myself needed to use the Apple mouse again.
Once I did that I decided to "force" myself to give it a fair shot and, now,
I'm glad I did. Much like with the keyboard, despite me having a bias against
what it is, this has turned out to be one of the most comfortable mice I've
ever used. It sits right in the hand, the lack of actual buttons means I don't
have to shape my hand to fit the design but, instead, the design allows for
how my hand rests. I also rather like the gestures too.</p>
<p>This is the first mouse that has stayed on my desktop. I'm surprised.</p>
<p>By the way, whoever thought that the "natural" scroll option, which is on by
default, was "natural", is barking mad.</p>
<h1>The GUI</h1>
<p>One of the main intended uses for this machine is the Unix shell, working
inside the terminal. Given that the actual UI of the OS doesn't matter so
much to me. That said, I'm finding it pretty pleasant. I find it a lot
tidier-looking than Windows, although I also find it more frustrating in
some places.</p>
<p>One good example is in the Finder, when I have a folder open. I find that it's
quite common for me, on Windows, when I have an Explorer window open, to want
to copy the path of the folder for use elsewhere. That's very easy to do
because the path is in an edit field at the top of the window and can be
edited and copied. If there's a way to do this with the OS X Finder I've
yet to figure that one one.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm still not getting used to, and I'm still very unconvinced by,
as a design decision, is the business of having an application's menus always
appear at the top of the screen disconnected from the application windows
themselves. I appreciate that this is a very Apple/Mac way of doing things
but I really can't get used to the idea -- especially given that it gives
the (incorrect) impression that the whole GUI is really single tasking.</p>
<p>On the whole though most of this doesn't matter too much to me. Large parts
of what I'm doing is in the terminal window, with other parts of it being
in my editors of choice (either SublimeText or GNU emacs, depending on what
I'm doing) or inside Google Chrome. In other words the general experience is
one that carries over most of the main operating systems I've used on
desktop machines.</p>
<h1>Installing software</h1>
<p>For an operating system that prides itself on being simple to use and easy
to understand, and especially one whose bigger fans sell as being simple to
use and easy to understand (especially in relation to Windows), the whole
business of installing software seems very confusing and very scrappy.</p>
<p>So far I've found a few different ways of installing software and none of it
makes a whole lot of sense to me without going and searching about it and
reading up on it. Sometimes I download an app and all I need to do is drag
it into the Applications folder. Other times I get a zip which I have to open
and then... it can go a couple of different ways. Sometimes I get a 'dmg' and
when I open that up I get a window where I have to drag one icon onto another
icon in that window to do the install. Sometimes I get something like the last
one I mention but instead I have to double-click on an icon that's in the
window.</p>
<p>There might even be other options I've had to follow. I forget now.</p>
<p>And then there's the business of removing software! That seems to be complete
chaos. In some cases you delete the app and it's all good. In other cases
you need to do that and hunt down some other bits and remove them too. In
other cases it seems like the author has supplied their own uninstaller.</p>
<p>We've been here before. I know this setup rather well. This is exactly the
sort of world we lived in back when Windows 3.1 was a new thing. This came as
and still is a massive surprise to me: OS X is as sophisticated as a fancy
shell that ran on top of MS DOS when it comes to software management.</p>
<h1>Doing the right thing, except when not</h1>
<p>While I'm on the subject of the famous great design of the Mac... what's up
with the business of seeing the time format? The system preferences seem
very flexible when it comes to setting date and time formats. I really like
the dialog that provides this:</p>
<p><img alt="Setting the date format" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.23.39.png"></p>
<p>As you might see above, my preference when it comes to date formats is to have
everything in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> format.
Having set that I then noticed that the time shown in the menu bar on the
desktop was.... whatever the hell Apple appear to have decided for me!</p>
<p><img alt="This is not the date format I asked for" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.26.18.png"></p>
<p>Even Windows lets me set the date format as I want it in the desktop time
display. Apple, meanwhile, seem to provide a great method of letting you
set your date and time formats "just so" and then they seem to just go right
ahead and ignore your preference in the one place you'll see it the most.</p>
<h1>If you have a Mac, you have software I wrote on it (I think)</h1>
<p>From what I could tell every Mac has a copy of GNU emacs installed, out of the
box. That actually kind of impressed me. Sure, it's a rather out of date
version of GNU emacs, but it's a copy of GNU emacs and that's all that matters.</p>
<p><img alt="It's a GNU emacs!" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.31.18.png"></p>
<p>That fact actually means something rather interesting, to me. See, there's
two small packages that are part of GNU emacs that I originally wrote. One is
called 5x5, the other quickurl.</p>
<p><img alt="My rubbish claim to fame" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.32.58.png"></p>
<p>So, yeah, from what I can see, on every new Mac you'll find two bodies of
code that I originally wrote, pre-installed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, shitty claim to fame. I'll take it anyway. ;)</p>
<h1>Overall initial impression</h1>
<p>Overall my initial impression is a good one. The Apple iMac seems to make for
a pretty good Unix workstation. The keyboard layout could do with some work
to make it more friendly to programmers (well, to this programmer) but
overall it all makes sense and is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If most of what you do is actually online then I'd say that an iMac would be
a huge waste of money. If you want a desktop machine for web browsing and
generally working "in the cloud" then you'd do a lot better to buy a Chromebase
(or, of course, a Chromebook if you're looking at Macbooks). On top of this,
if most of what you're doing is online but you want to do some client-side
stuff such as image/video editing and gaming then I struggle to see how an iMac
would be a good choice too. For the money it's hilariously underpowered
when compared to a reasonably equivalent Windows PC (or, of course, GNU/Linux
machine if what you want to do can be done there).</p>
<p>My own reasons for purchase were about having a desktop Unix workstation that
I could install various compilers on so I could muck about and work on some
fun projects I want to get done. It was an unusual extravagance that I don't
regret and, so far, I've been pleased with.</p>
<p>There's very few people I'd actually recommend one to though as it seems
pretty clear to me that, generally, their money could buy them so much more.</p>
<p>But it's a nice new shiny toy. ;)</p></div>

      <div><p>Following on from
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/06/25/did-google-just-break-wear-timers.html">yesterday's problem with the Android Wear timer</a>
I think I now have a solution. It came up
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/RZujypG7EyF">while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue</a>.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I've seen a number of
times before with Google stuff. One thing that's rather common (in many cases
for very obvious reasons -- you can't cover the whole world in one go) with
Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This
felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared
to be unaffected by the issue (I'm guessing he's on the latest version of
Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that
became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out
he was the same as me: British English.</p>
<p>So much for that idea.</p>
<p>But then he suggested switching to US English and back again.</p>
<p>Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft "turn it off and on again" approach to
a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and
really do suffer the same issues) I switched to en-US on the phone and tried
setting a timer in voice on the watch.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>So then I switched back to en-GB on the phone and...</p>
<p><img alt="I appear to have timers working again" src="/attachments/2015/06/26/Timer Running on Watch.png"></p>
<p>...it still worked!</p>
<p>I've tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it's yet
to fail.</p>
<p>It would appear, as odd as it is, that this is the fix. Well, a fix.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I woke up this morning to find that one of my more recent favourite websites,
<a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, had finally released an Android application.
I'm more of an avid reader than a writer on there (I've only ever written
2 articles on there, and have toyed with the import facility too) so I imagine
the app won't make too much of a difference to me, but it was nice to see
that something that had been iOS-only was now on Android too.</p>
<p>I installed it on my Nexus 7 and Nexus 6 and then, given that
<a href="http://blog.davep.org/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I have an iOS device now</a>,
I installed it on that too. In doing so I noticed a very curious difference:</p>
<p><img alt="Medium login on Android" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-11-24-11.png"></p>
<p>vs:</p>
<p><img alt="Medium login on iOS" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Photo 25-06-2015 09 38 02.png"></p>
<p>Notice how Android has Google as an option whereas that's not an option on
iOS? The curious thing is, when I installed it on my Android devices,
I logged in with my Google account and it all just worked. I was into my
account, there were the sorts of stories I'd be interested in, and there were
the couple of stories I'd written.</p>
<p>On iOS I logged in with my Twitter account and the same thing happened (I
don't use and don't have an account on Facebook).</p>
<p>It was than that I had to think about how I even logged into Medium normally
(via the web, which is what I'd always used up until now). Seems I'd always
used the Twitter login (which would make sense).</p>
<p>So here's the thing that's got me wondering now: when I logged in with my
Google account, how did it make the connection to my Twitter account? I mean,
sure, there's got to be enough data kicking around to actually make the
connection and it seems like a safe enough one to make but... huh? I must be
missing something here though, it's as unexpected as it is handy.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that if you go to log in to the website Google accounts
are not an option (there is a sub-option for "Android Users" where you have
to create an account based off your email address, from what I can see).</p>
<p>I'm left trying to decide if I missed a step here, if this is clever, or if this
is just plain creepy (and who's responsible for having made the connection).</p>
<p><em>Edit to add:</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/caramev">Cara</a> from Medium was kind enough
to notice my tweet pointing to this post and <a href="https://twitter.com/caramev/status/614098764450496512">let me know the how and why of
the above</a>. Turns out
it's what Rich suggested in the comments.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I'm on a bit of a "explore other universes" trip at the moment, it would seem.
The other weekend I finally cracked and purchased my first ever OS X device
and, earlier today, I purchased my first ever iOS device.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm not abandoning the world of Android; far from it if my
experiences of iOS so far are anything to go by. However, having started
slowly working through a book that teaches Cocoa and Swift I thought it might
be interesting to be in a position, at some point in the future, to be able
to make and throw an app at an iOS device and it seemed the most affordable
way of doing that was to grab an iPod.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p><img alt="I now own an iPod" src="/attachments/2015/06/23/Photo 23-06-2015 22 50 51.png#centre"></p>
<p>One of the first things I did, and I'm glad to find it was possible, was to
load it up with apps that make it into a reasonable Google device (so, so far,
I've got Gmail, Google+, Google Calendar and Google Music on there -- need
to sort Google Drive too, at least). Next up was to get some music on it too --
might as well actually use it to listen to music, I guess.</p>
<p>That actually turned out to be more fun than I was expecting. See, I gave up
on iTunes many years ago, back when it was pretty much the only legit method
of buying music online. Since then I've tended to work with ripped copies of
my CD collection or I've listened to music I've bought on Google Play (the
latter bulked out with the former thanks to Google's music uploader).</p>
<p>And here's the fun part: if you use the recent Google Music Chrome app (which,
it seems, allows unlimited downloads of your albums) to pull the music down,
and drop them into iTune's import folder, magic happens and iTunes gets
nearly populated with music. Even better, music that I'd originally ripped as
WMAs comes back own as mp3s, so solving the problem of iTunes not doing WMAs.</p>
<p>Handy!</p>
<p>So, anyway, that's the iPod set up as a generally useful device.</p>
<p>As for iOS itself.... Ugh. I'm far from impressed. Compared to Android it
feels old and clunky and very constraining. For example, I can't <em>really</em>
control what's on the home page. Sure, I can move things about, and I can
even remove apps I've installed, but I can't remove/hide Apple's own apps
at all. The best I've managed to do is drop all of them in a folder together
and ignore that folder.</p>
<p>I'm finding the whole navigation thing kind of frustrating too. The lack of
a standard back button -- as you have on Android -- means that different apps
seem to do different things in terms of allowing back navigation. I'm also
still unsure how you can easily task switch (if there is a way of doing that
it's not obvious to me).</p>
<p>Another thing that's frustrating me is "AirDrop". I tried to use it to get
the screenshot you see above onto my iMac but nothing I did would make it work.
The iPod would see the iMac and the iMac would see the iPod but the filed
didn't appear to want to move at all.</p>
<p>Yet another thing that seems rather unstable is the whole business of WiFi
sync. That seems like a sensible idea -- let iTunes on the Mac know that
the iPod lives on the same network and have them sync that way. Problem is
that I'm finding that it drop out during a sync more often than not. The only
reliable method of doing a sync that I've found is to use the USB cable.</p>
<p>I've yet to write the blog post about my experiences with the Mac so far
but what I'm finding here fits in with what I've found with the Mac: some
of the ideas are really rather clever but they just don't quite work as
well as people would seem to want to have you believe. Apple gear has this
reputation of "just working" and I'm finding that this really doesn't seem
to be the case at all.</p>
<p>Still, it's all a learning process and I know far more about Apple gear now
than I did a week or so back, and I'm learning more as I go.</p></div>

      <div><p>The ChromeOS file manager has always been a bit.... rubbish. Kind of. Back
in the very early days it only let you work with the Chromebook's (very
small) local file system. Then, some time later, they added Google Drive
integration, which was seriously handy. But it still lacked some important
stuff, like the ability to mount filesystems from Windows machines, or to use
sftp, or the like.</p>
<p>That seems to have all changed with the addition of the "Add new services"
button:</p>
<p><img alt="Now I can add more stuff!" src="/attachments/2015/06/22/Screenshot 2015-06-22 at 16.48.11.png"></p>
<p>As is often the way with Chromebooks, unless you're closely following forums
or Google+ communities (I don't), you tend not to know when this stuff is going
to turn up or even when it does (I mean, really, is it too much to ask that
the device alert you to handy new features? I mean,
<a href="/2015/06/20/moto360-updated.html">my watch did</a>!). For all I know this has
been there a while and it's the first time I've noticed.</p>
<p>No mater how long it's been there, it's really rather handy. I've already
been able to hook it up to my Dropbox account, there's an SMB filesystem
handler (that I've not had a chance to test yet) and an sftp service
(which I have tested and seem to work well enough for my needs). There's
more too:</p>
<p><img alt="Handlers for all" src="/attachments/2015/06/22/Screenshot 2015-06-22 at 16.48.52.png"></p>
<p>I'm guessing there's an API out there now that people can work with so I guess
the list of services you can install will grow over time.</p>
<p>For people who want to do a little more than just browse the web, Chromebooks
(and other Chrome* devices for that matter) just got a little more useful.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since the last update I've being having a rather odd issue on my old Chromebook.
This is my Samsung Series 5, the "original" commercial Chromebook to be released
(in the UK anyway). I first noticed it in TweetDeck but have since noticed that
it's affecting any browser tab. Simply put, sections of the display either
"lag" in their content or they simply show up empty.</p>
<p>First I tried to get a screenshot of what was going on but it didn't work. I
did get to show that there was a problem, but what was grabbed by the screenshot
wasn't what I saw seeing on the screen. Here's the screenshot:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of new ChromeOS issue" src="/attachments/2015/06/21/Screenshot 2015-06-21 at 18.27.55.png"></p>
<p>The only way I can show how it looked to me on the screen is with a (rather
horrible I'm afraid) photo:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of what the screen actually looked like" src="/attachments/2015/06/21/IMG_20150621_183146.jpg"></p>
<p>It's unclear to me if this is something wrong with the Chromebook itself, or
in this release of the OS. It is running the beta channel -- currently on
44.0.2403.54 -- so, of course, this sort of thing is to be expected.</p>
<p>If it is the case that that Chromebook is on its way out -- either in terms of
that actual machine dying or support for it at the OS level going away -- it
won't be a terrible loss. It's been a great machine and has served me well
and wasn't terribly expensive to begin with (the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVqe8ieqz10">lack of expense</a> is one of
the things I really like about Chromebooks, which is why the Pixel continues
to perplex me), replacing it with one of the newer crop of Chromebooks won't
break the bank.</p>
<p>But I'd be a little sad to see it go, I've done some pretty significant things
on it and it is, in some ways, a little bit of computer history.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Edit to add:</em> I've now moved it back over to the stable channel, with a
powerwash on the way (of course) and this seems to have done the trick. I'm
no longer seeing any problems. The switch to stable even had the problem
showing. Here's a video of stable downloading:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKURvastEAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>That's pretty much the sort of thing I was seeing all over the place, and it
appeared to be getting worse as time went on.</p>
<p>Hopefully this was a one-off and the problem isn't simply up in the beta
cannel and waiting to head down to stable.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday evening I finally got the following notification on my Moto360:</p>
<p><img alt="Moto360 Update Notification" src="/attachments/2015/06/20/Moto360Update.png"></p>
<p>Given the charge was quite a way below that I took the watch off and put it
on charge and then did the update later.</p>
<p>From what I could tell it all went pretty smooth. After updating it even
offered me a little tutorial on some of the new things it's added. So far
I've used (or set up) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The much better "launcher"
  Finding and running apps on the watch was always a bit of a pain, so much so
  that others had even written special launchers for Android Wear. This seems
  to be pretty much solved now. Pressing and holding the watch's side button
  will pop up application list, from here you can swipe right to your
  contacts (them letting you send messages, start calls, etc) and right again
  for the usual list of actions that you used to go straight into.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way it's done now makes a lot more sense and seems far cleaner.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi
  I've yet to notice the benefit of this, but I've not paid too much attention
  yet either. The watch now does WiFi. This is supposed to mean that it can
  still work with my phone when it's out of Bluetooth range. I say I don't know
  if it's working yet because I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.derfreimann.wear.widgets.miniconnectionnotifier&amp;hl=en_GB">an app to tell me if my phone is out of
  range</a>
  and it still keeps tripping as normal -- but I'm unsure if that means
  it's simply telling me it's out of BT range but really the watch is now
  doing its thing over WiFi, or perhaps the phone connection really has been
  lost despite me having set up the WiFi connection. More testing needs to
  happen here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting this up was curious: I had to turn it on on the watch and then
  select the access points I wanted to work with, again on the watch. But to
  actually connect I had to switch back to my phone to enter the AP passwords
  (which makes perfect sense of course, nobody wants to type passwords into
  a watch face).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gestures
  These needed to be turned on in settings. I've being using them this morning
  to navigate cards on the watch and it's really well done and really natural.
  Simply put, you flick your wrist up, or down, to "flick" from one card to
  another. All it seems to be missing is some method of gesturing that I want
  to swipe a card out of the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than the above it's pretty much business as usual. Hopefully there's
been some work to improve battery life and all that sort of stuff, and only
time will tell if a difference has been made there.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've no idea when this happened, and I'll admit that the advice it gives is
advice I've mostly being following anyway for quite a long time, but it seems
that ssh in the ChromeOS terminal has been removed. This is what just happened
when I tried to use it just now:</p>
<p><img alt="ChromeOS ssh no longer working" src="/attachments/2015/06/19/Screenshot 2015-06-19 at 09.03.58.png"></p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">Chrome Secure Shell</a>
is pretty damn good and has served me well for the past couple or so years,
working well on the Chromebook and on Windows 7 and 8 (and also now on the Mac,
although I'm tending to use ssh in its native terminal more).</p>
<p>I wonder if any other of the limited features of the ChromeOS terminal (in
non-dev mode anyway) are going to go the same way?</p>
<hr>
<p>As an aside to the above, something kind of ironic happened as I was writing
this. I opened Chrome so I could preview the post as I was writing it and
I suffered one of Chrome's rather common extension crashes. Look what one of
those extensions was (and I wasn't even using it at the time):</p>
