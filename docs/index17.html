  <div>
      <div><p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I woke up this morning to find that one of my more recent favourite websites,
<a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, had finally released an Android application.
I'm more of an avid reader than a writer on there (I've only ever written
2 articles on there, and have toyed with the import facility too) so I imagine
the app won't make too much of a difference to me, but it was nice to see
that something that had been iOS-only was now on Android too.</p>
<p>I installed it on my Nexus 7 and Nexus 6 and then, given that
<a href="http://blog.davep.org/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I have an iOS device now</a>,
I installed it on that too. In doing so I noticed a very curious difference:</p>
<p><img alt="Medium login on Android" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-11-24-11.png"></p>
<p>vs:</p>
<p><img alt="Medium login on iOS" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Photo 25-06-2015 09 38 02.png"></p>
<p>Notice how Android has Google as an option whereas that's not an option on
iOS? The curious thing is, when I installed it on my Android devices,
I logged in with my Google account and it all just worked. I was into my
account, there were the sorts of stories I'd be interested in, and there were
the couple of stories I'd written.</p>
<p>On iOS I logged in with my Twitter account and the same thing happened (I
don't use and don't have an account on Facebook).</p>
<p>It was than that I had to think about how I even logged into Medium normally
(via the web, which is what I'd always used up until now). Seems I'd always
used the Twitter login (which would make sense).</p>
<p>So here's the thing that's got me wondering now: when I logged in with my
Google account, how did it make the connection to my Twitter account? I mean,
sure, there's got to be enough data kicking around to actually make the
connection and it seems like a safe enough one to make but... huh? I must be
missing something here though, it's as unexpected as it is handy.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that if you go to log in to the website Google accounts
are not an option (there is a sub-option for "Android Users" where you have
to create an account based off your email address, from what I can see).</p>
<p>I'm left trying to decide if I missed a step here, if this is clever, or if this
is just plain creepy (and who's responsible for having made the connection).</p>
<p><em>Edit to add:</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/caramev">Cara</a> from Medium was kind enough
to notice my tweet pointing to this post and <a href="https://twitter.com/caramev/status/614098764450496512">let me know the how and why of
the above</a>. Turns out
it's what Rich suggested in the comments.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I'm on a bit of a "explore other universes" trip at the moment, it would seem.
The other weekend I finally cracked and purchased my first ever OS X device
and, earlier today, I purchased my first ever iOS device.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm not abandoning the world of Android; far from it if my
experiences of iOS so far are anything to go by. However, having started
slowly working through a book that teaches Cocoa and Swift I thought it might
be interesting to be in a position, at some point in the future, to be able
to make and throw an app at an iOS device and it seemed the most affordable
way of doing that was to grab an iPod.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p><img alt="I now own an iPod" src="/attachments/2015/06/23/Photo 23-06-2015 22 50 51.png#centre"></p>
<p>One of the first things I did, and I'm glad to find it was possible, was to
load it up with apps that make it into a reasonable Google device (so, so far,
I've got Gmail, Google+, Google Calendar and Google Music on there -- need
to sort Google Drive too, at least). Next up was to get some music on it too --
might as well actually use it to listen to music, I guess.</p>
<p>That actually turned out to be more fun than I was expecting. See, I gave up
on iTunes many years ago, back when it was pretty much the only legit method
of buying music online. Since then I've tended to work with ripped copies of
my CD collection or I've listened to music I've bought on Google Play (the
latter bulked out with the former thanks to Google's music uploader).</p>
<p>And here's the fun part: if you use the recent Google Music Chrome app (which,
it seems, allows unlimited downloads of your albums) to pull the music down,
and drop them into iTune's import folder, magic happens and iTunes gets
nearly populated with music. Even better, music that I'd originally ripped as
WMAs comes back own as mp3s, so solving the problem of iTunes not doing WMAs.</p>
<p>Handy!</p>
<p>So, anyway, that's the iPod set up as a generally useful device.</p>
<p>As for iOS itself.... Ugh. I'm far from impressed. Compared to Android it
feels old and clunky and very constraining. For example, I can't <em>really</em>
control what's on the home page. Sure, I can move things about, and I can
even remove apps I've installed, but I can't remove/hide Apple's own apps
at all. The best I've managed to do is drop all of them in a folder together
and ignore that folder.</p>
<p>I'm finding the whole navigation thing kind of frustrating too. The lack of
a standard back button -- as you have on Android -- means that different apps
seem to do different things in terms of allowing back navigation. I'm also
still unsure how you can easily task switch (if there is a way of doing that
it's not obvious to me).</p>
<p>Another thing that's frustrating me is "AirDrop". I tried to use it to get
the screenshot you see above onto my iMac but nothing I did would make it work.
The iPod would see the iMac and the iMac would see the iPod but the filed
didn't appear to want to move at all.</p>
<p>Yet another thing that seems rather unstable is the whole business of WiFi
sync. That seems like a sensible idea -- let iTunes on the Mac know that
the iPod lives on the same network and have them sync that way. Problem is
that I'm finding that it drop out during a sync more often than not. The only
reliable method of doing a sync that I've found is to use the USB cable.</p>
<p>I've yet to write the blog post about my experiences with the Mac so far
but what I'm finding here fits in with what I've found with the Mac: some
of the ideas are really rather clever but they just don't quite work as
well as people would seem to want to have you believe. Apple gear has this
reputation of "just working" and I'm finding that this really doesn't seem
to be the case at all.</p>
<p>Still, it's all a learning process and I know far more about Apple gear now
than I did a week or so back, and I'm learning more as I go.</p></div>

      <div><p>The ChromeOS file manager has always been a bit.... rubbish. Kind of. Back
in the very early days it only let you work with the Chromebook's (very
small) local file system. Then, some time later, they added Google Drive
integration, which was seriously handy. But it still lacked some important
stuff, like the ability to mount filesystems from Windows machines, or to use
sftp, or the like.</p>
<p>That seems to have all changed with the addition of the "Add new services"
button:</p>
<p><img alt="Now I can add more stuff!" src="/attachments/2015/06/22/Screenshot 2015-06-22 at 16.48.11.png"></p>
<p>As is often the way with Chromebooks, unless you're closely following forums
or Google+ communities (I don't), you tend not to know when this stuff is going
to turn up or even when it does (I mean, really, is it too much to ask that
the device alert you to handy new features? I mean,
<a href="/2015/06/20/moto360-updated.html">my watch did</a>!). For all I know this has
been there a while and it's the first time I've noticed.</p>
<p>No mater how long it's been there, it's really rather handy. I've already
been able to hook it up to my Dropbox account, there's an SMB filesystem
handler (that I've not had a chance to test yet) and an sftp service
(which I have tested and seem to work well enough for my needs). There's
more too:</p>
<p><img alt="Handlers for all" src="/attachments/2015/06/22/Screenshot 2015-06-22 at 16.48.52.png"></p>
<p>I'm guessing there's an API out there now that people can work with so I guess
the list of services you can install will grow over time.</p>
<p>For people who want to do a little more than just browse the web, Chromebooks
(and other Chrome* devices for that matter) just got a little more useful.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since the last update I've being having a rather odd issue on my old Chromebook.
This is my Samsung Series 5, the "original" commercial Chromebook to be released
(in the UK anyway). I first noticed it in TweetDeck but have since noticed that
it's affecting any browser tab. Simply put, sections of the display either
"lag" in their content or they simply show up empty.</p>
<p>First I tried to get a screenshot of what was going on but it didn't work. I
did get to show that there was a problem, but what was grabbed by the screenshot
wasn't what I saw seeing on the screen. Here's the screenshot:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of new ChromeOS issue" src="/attachments/2015/06/21/Screenshot 2015-06-21 at 18.27.55.png"></p>
<p>The only way I can show how it looked to me on the screen is with a (rather
horrible I'm afraid) photo:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of what the screen actually looked like" src="/attachments/2015/06/21/IMG_20150621_183146.jpg"></p>
<p>It's unclear to me if this is something wrong with the Chromebook itself, or
in this release of the OS. It is running the beta channel -- currently on
44.0.2403.54 -- so, of course, this sort of thing is to be expected.</p>
<p>If it is the case that that Chromebook is on its way out -- either in terms of
that actual machine dying or support for it at the OS level going away -- it
won't be a terrible loss. It's been a great machine and has served me well
and wasn't terribly expensive to begin with (the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVqe8ieqz10">lack of expense</a> is one of
the things I really like about Chromebooks, which is why the Pixel continues
to perplex me), replacing it with one of the newer crop of Chromebooks won't
break the bank.</p>
<p>But I'd be a little sad to see it go, I've done some pretty significant things
on it and it is, in some ways, a little bit of computer history.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Edit to add:</em> I've now moved it back over to the stable channel, with a
powerwash on the way (of course) and this seems to have done the trick. I'm
no longer seeing any problems. The switch to stable even had the problem
showing. Here's a video of stable downloading:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKURvastEAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>That's pretty much the sort of thing I was seeing all over the place, and it
appeared to be getting worse as time went on.</p>
<p>Hopefully this was a one-off and the problem isn't simply up in the beta
cannel and waiting to head down to stable.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday evening I finally got the following notification on my Moto360:</p>
<p><img alt="Moto360 Update Notification" src="/attachments/2015/06/20/Moto360Update.png"></p>
<p>Given the charge was quite a way below that I took the watch off and put it
on charge and then did the update later.</p>
<p>From what I could tell it all went pretty smooth. After updating it even
offered me a little tutorial on some of the new things it's added. So far
I've used (or set up) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The much better "launcher"
  Finding and running apps on the watch was always a bit of a pain, so much so
  that others had even written special launchers for Android Wear. This seems
  to be pretty much solved now. Pressing and holding the watch's side button
  will pop up application list, from here you can swipe right to your
  contacts (them letting you send messages, start calls, etc) and right again
  for the usual list of actions that you used to go straight into.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way it's done now makes a lot more sense and seems far cleaner.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi
  I've yet to notice the benefit of this, but I've not paid too much attention
  yet either. The watch now does WiFi. This is supposed to mean that it can
  still work with my phone when it's out of Bluetooth range. I say I don't know
  if it's working yet because I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.derfreimann.wear.widgets.miniconnectionnotifier&amp;hl=en_GB">an app to tell me if my phone is out of
  range</a>
  and it still keeps tripping as normal -- but I'm unsure if that means
  it's simply telling me it's out of BT range but really the watch is now
  doing its thing over WiFi, or perhaps the phone connection really has been
  lost despite me having set up the WiFi connection. More testing needs to
  happen here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting this up was curious: I had to turn it on on the watch and then
  select the access points I wanted to work with, again on the watch. But to
  actually connect I had to switch back to my phone to enter the AP passwords
  (which makes perfect sense of course, nobody wants to type passwords into
  a watch face).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gestures
  These needed to be turned on in settings. I've being using them this morning
  to navigate cards on the watch and it's really well done and really natural.
  Simply put, you flick your wrist up, or down, to "flick" from one card to
  another. All it seems to be missing is some method of gesturing that I want
  to swipe a card out of the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than the above it's pretty much business as usual. Hopefully there's
been some work to improve battery life and all that sort of stuff, and only
time will tell if a difference has been made there.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've no idea when this happened, and I'll admit that the advice it gives is
advice I've mostly being following anyway for quite a long time, but it seems
that ssh in the ChromeOS terminal has been removed. This is what just happened
when I tried to use it just now:</p>
<p><img alt="ChromeOS ssh no longer working" src="/attachments/2015/06/19/Screenshot 2015-06-19 at 09.03.58.png"></p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">Chrome Secure Shell</a>
is pretty damn good and has served me well for the past couple or so years,
working well on the Chromebook and on Windows 7 and 8 (and also now on the Mac,
although I'm tending to use ssh in its native terminal more).</p>
<p>I wonder if any other of the limited features of the ChromeOS terminal (in
non-dev mode anyway) are going to go the same way?</p>
<hr>
<p>As an aside to the above, something kind of ironic happened as I was writing
this. I opened Chrome so I could preview the post as I was writing it and
I suffered one of Chrome's rather common extension crashes. Look what one of
those extensions was (and I wasn't even using it at the time):</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome ssh extension crashes for no reason" src="/attachments/2015/06/19/Screen Shot 2015-06-19 at 09.12.34.png"></p>
<p>Not exactly the best advert for the non-optional replacement.</p></div>

      <div><p>For a long time now Chrome has been my web browser of choice. It has, to some
degree, become my "other emacs" (ignoring for a moment that my use of GNU
emacs has sort of lapsed the last few years). By that I mean that it's a
portable environment that serves me well on many operating systems and, for
one of my machines, actually <em>is</em> the operating system. I really appreciate how
Chrome's sync lets me feel right at home no matter which machine I'm on.</p>
<p>But I've run into one small issue that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>In some situations I find it pleasing, and I find it makes sense, that some
web "apps" open in a window of their own rather than in a Chrome tab. On Windows
and on ChromeOS this is simple enough, all I need to do is find the "app" in
the Chrome app launcher, pull up the content menu, and tell it to open as a
window.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on Windows 7" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextWin.png"></p>
<p>Nice and simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac, so well known for doing everything every other OS does but doing
it better and being easier to use.... you'd expect it's at least the same there,
right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on OS X" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextMac.png"></p>
<p>There's no option at all to open as a window!</p>
<p>So, on the Mac, while I'd love to be able to open Gmail as a window/app in its
own right, I'm totally out of luck, it seems. I've no idea whose "fault" this
is. It's not clear to me if this is a Chrome/Google decision or if it's about
how things have to work on a Mac. Thing is, I find it hard to believe that
it's the latter given that Google Keep runs in its own window on the Mac and
I can happily pin it to the dock.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It's that simple on ChromeOS too. In case you're wondering why I
didn't also illustrate that, it's because you can't take a screenshot on
ChromeOS while you've got a context menu open. O_o&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <div><p>Hello, world.</p>
<p>So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set
of posts on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts">Google+</a> or a torrent
of 140-character thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">twitter</a> but
an actual blog.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects
I want to have a go at over the next few months and writing about them as I
work on them might be fun. Another reason is that I've being wanting to explore
the business of hosting a blog on GitHub pages for quite some time and now's
the perfect time to do it.</p>
<p>So how am I doing this? Well, for starters, I recently acquired an iMac. The
reasons for how and why I chose to do this are varied and mostly uninteresting
but what it does mean is that, for the first time in quite a long time, I
have a Unix desktop machine again. This fact alone means it's nice and easy
for me to play with the likes of Git (or, at the moment more
<a href="https://mac.github.com/">GitHub for Mac</a> than the command line git), ruby,
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> (along with
<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll">a rather nifty package for quickly kicking off a blog post</a>).
So that's how I'm doing it. Writing it all locally and pushing it up to
GitHub and hosting it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>As this goes on I imagine much will change. I've started out with a basic
setup, created by simply using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>davep@Ariel:~/blogging$<span class="w"> </span>jekyll<span class="w"> </span>new<span class="w"> </span>davep.github.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>From now on I'll be playing with styles and my own layouts to see what I can
come up with and what I like (although, I most say, for the most part I'm
actually liking the clean look it delivers out of the box).</p>
<p>One thing that's obviously missing right now is a facility for commenting.
That's something I'll look into should I feel it's necessary -- from what I've
seen elsewhere it's easy enough to make use of something like
<a href="https://disqus.com/">disqus</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>One other thing I might look at doing is putting this behind my own domain.
For the moment it's only available via github.io and I guess it might look
nicer if it was actually available via a URL that looks like the name I've
attached to the blog. <strong>Update:</strong> This has now happened.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's it for now. Time to push this up and think some more about
where it'll go from here.</p></div>
