    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>As detailed in a blog post I wrote <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">back in
2016</a>, I first got into
using Emacs in the mid 1990s, starting with it on OS/2 and then moving over
to GNU/Linux. It's been my often-used and much-loved development environment
for most of those years (I even have a couple of packages that are part of
Emacs itself).</p>
<p>For most of that time my configuration was a single <code>~/.emacs</code> file, which
was around 1,000 lines in length (including comments and whitespace). It'd
grown over the years, having special configuration sections for versions of
Emacs I didn't use any more, and operating systems I didn't work on any more
(yes, really, there were things in there specific to MS-DOS, for example).
On top of that I always hand-installed packages I used -- Emacs' package
management system having turned up long after I first got into using Emacs.</p>
<p>Then, in early 2016, I decided to nuke the whole thing and start from
scratch. As mentioned above, the start of this <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">is detailed in an older
post</a>. Another big round of
changes <a href="/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html">happened round a year
later</a> -- which included
the birth of <a href="http://blog.davep.org/delpa/">delpa</a> to manage my personal
packages. A couple or so months later there was <a href="/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html">one last big round of
changes</a>, mostly killing
off my enthusiastic embracing of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization"><code>customize</code></a>
and instead going back to hand-set settings, only this time done via
<a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package"><code>use-package</code></a>.</p>
<p>The full history of this <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d">can be found over on
GitHub</a>, starting with the first "throw
everything away and start again" process and all the steps between then and
where my Emacs configuration is now.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the fun part of this blog post. Earlier this week I
stumbled on <a href="https://gource.io/">Gource</a>. It's a tool that's primarily
designed to visualise changes in repositories, although it can be used to
visualise anything that has a tree structure and changes over time (this
week I produced a video of the growth of my employer's electronic lab
notebook by hooking up the <a href="https://www.benchling.com/">Benchling</a> API with
Gource, for example). So I got curious. What did it look like as I reworked
and tweaked and changed and tinkered with my Emacs configuration?</p>
<p>This is what it looked like:</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>By coincidence, in a couple of different places over the last couple of
weeks, the subject of <em>"how do I progress in leaning to program?"</em> has
cropped up. For me, I think the approaches and solutions tend to be the same
for when I want to get my head around a new language: read good examples of
idiomatic code, read other related materials, find a problem you care about
and implement a solution (ideally something you'll directly benefit from, or
at least others may benefit from). Hence the <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">5x5 puzzle and Norton Guide
reader projects I mentioned in my previous
post</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has problems that they need solving in a way that
would work for this approach. So another approach I've recommended in the
past is to go looking on somewhere like GitHub and find projects that
promote "low-hanging fruit" issues in a way that's designed to be friendly
for those who are new to development, new to contributing or new to the
problem domain.</p>
<p>While looking for examples of this yesterday I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners"><em>Awesome for
Beginners</em></a>. This looks
like a great list and one I'm going to keep <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep/">bookmarked for future
reference</a>. Now, this particular list does
seem to have an emphasis on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/issues/215">pulling in people who are new to contributing
to a project</a>
rather than new to development, but it does strike me as a good place to
start looking no matter where you're coming from.</p>
<p>I know I'm going to start having a wander around that list. It's always nice
to contribute and I feel there's real personal benefit in actively solving a
problem that someone else has and welcomes help with.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's hardly a revelation to say that learning a new programming language, or
even learning software development at all, is even more difficult if you
don't have an actual problem to solve. I know I'm not alone in having pet
projects that, when faced with a new environment, I'll code up a version of
that project as a way to get familiar with and understand a language's
idioms while implementing something I know well.</p>
<p>Personally, my two favourites are a puzzle called 5x5
(<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.xml">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/Chrome-5x5">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-for-Chrome">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-Palm">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.el">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-react">here</a> and
<a href="http://davep.org/misc/5x5/">here</a>), and writing a library or even a full
application to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides">Norton Guide database
files</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg1013">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG">here</a>). Both are fun to work on, have
practical uses, and both have the benefit of being solved problems (for me)
that let me concentrate on the "how do I do <em>X</em> in this
language/toolkit/environment/framework/etc?".</p>
<p>Even with those two as my goto projects, I'm always open to new small
problems that might be fun to apply to languages I do know, or languages I
want to get to know (internally at work <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1123952281156751361">we have a fun "league" of sorts,
writing a particular hamming distance calculation tool in different
languages</a>, for
example).</p>
<p>A few days ago, via <a href="https://github.com/Lethrir/Journeys">this repo on
GitHub</a>, I discovered <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys">this fun little
problem</a>. Right away I could see the
benefit in it. As a "go away and code up a solution" interview question it
strikes me as near-perfect. It's obviously not hard to solve, but it touches
on some basic but important aspects of software development and so will
allow the developer to show off how they approach things.</p>
<p>There's so many different approaches to it too. Even in a single language, I
could imagine having some fun writing the smallest code to solve the
problem, the most idiomatic code to solve the problem, the most supportable
and well-documented code to solve the problem, etc. And then there's the
thing I talk about above: knowing the solution and knowing it's easy, you
can then use it to learn the idiomatic way of solving the problem in new
languages.</p>
<p>Even better, <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys#other-solutions">the README of the original repo links to solutions others have
written</a>. Knowing
the problem, and knowing the solution, you can then go and read other
people's code and learn something about different styles and different
languages.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, as I get free time, I think I might just do this.
Take the "Journeys" problem and write versions in different languages I work
with, or know, and also use it to get to know languages I've yet to know or
use heavily (I'm especially keen to try a version in
<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> -- a language I really like the look of and
want to find a reason to use).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, yesterday, I had a quick go at a first version in Python (aimed
at Python 3.8 or higher):
<a href="https://github.com/davep/journeys.py">https://github.com/davep/journeys.py</a></p>
<p>I set out to try and write something that was fairly idiomatic Python, which
uses tools that I tend to employ when working on Python projects (pipenv,
make, etc), and which also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">used something I've never quite found a need for
so far</a> in my usual
coding, but which I can see being useful and helpful.</p>
<p>I even threw in a couple of uses of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/">PEP
572</a>!</p>
<p>I can see me tinkering with this some more over the next few days. I can
even see me writing a very different implementation in Python, just for the
fun of it.</p>
<p>I think that's what I like about this little problem. It's a good way to do
a bit of programming exercise; it's like the perfect way to do the
programming equivalent of going for a short run.</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I first got into Python in the mid-to-late 1990s. It's so far back that I
think the copy of <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/">Programming
Python</a> that I have (sadly in
storage at the moment) might be a first edition. I probably fell out of the
habit of using Python some time in the early 2000s (that was when I met
Ruby). It was only 22 months ago that I started using Python a <em>lot</em> thanks
to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">a change of
employer</a>.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, much had changed in the 15+ years since I'd last
written a line of Python in anger. So, early on, I made a point of making
<a href="https://www.pylint.org/">Pylint</a> part of my development process. All my
projects have a <code>make lint</code> make target. All of my projects lint the code
when I push to <code>master</code> in the company GitLab instance. These days I even
use <a href="https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a> to keep me honest as I
write my code; mostly gone are the days where I don't know of problems until
I do a <code>make lint</code>.</p>
<p>Leaning on Pylint in the early days of my new position made for a great
Python refresher for me. Now, I still lean on it to make sure I don't make
daft mistakes.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Pylint and I don't always agree. And that's fine. For example, I really
can't stand Pylint's approach to whitespace, and that is a hill I'll happily
die on. Ditto the obsession with lines being no more than 80 characters wide
(120 should be fine thanks). As such any project's <code>.pylintrc</code> has, as a
bare minimum, this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[FORMAT]</span>
<span class="na">max-line-length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">120</span>

<span class="k">[MESSAGES CONTROL]</span>
<span class="na">disable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">bad-whitespace</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Beyond that though, aside from one or two extras that pertain to particular
projects, I'm happy with what Pylint complains about.</p>
<p>There are exceptions though. There are times, simply due to the nature of
the code involved, that Pylint's insistence on code purity isn't going to
work. That's where I use its inline <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html#block-disables">block disabling
feature</a>.
It's handy and helps keep things clean (I won't deploy code that doesn't
pass 10/10), but there is always this nagging doubt: if I've disabled a
warning in the code, am I ever going to come back and revisit it?</p>
<p>To help me think about coming back to such disables now and again, I thought
it might be interesting to write a tool that'll show which warnings I
disable most. It resulted in <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/dd2721e0565928b4145698a42c9c74e4534c578a/conf.d/abbr.d/python.fish#L5">this fish
abbr</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr<span class="w"> </span>-g<span class="w"> </span>pylintshame<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;rg --no-messages \&quot;pylint:disable=\&quot; | awk &#39;BEGIN{FS=\&quot;disable=\&quot;;}{print \$2}&#39; | tr \&quot;,\&quot; \&quot;\n\&quot; | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea here being that it produces a "Pylint hall of shame", something
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">wildcard</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">import</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>To break the pipeline down:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rg --no-messages &quot;pylint:disable=&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>First off, I use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> (if you
don't, you might want to have a good look at it -- I find it amazingly
handy) to find everywhere in the code in and below the current directory
(the <code>--no-messages</code> switch just stops any file I/O errors that might result
from permission issues -- they're not interesting here) that contains a line
that has a Pylint block disable (if you tend to format yours differently,
you'll need to tweak the regular expression, of course).</p>
<p>I then pipe it through <code>awk</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">awk</span> <span class="s">&#39;BEGIN{FS=&quot;disable=&quot;;}{print $2}&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>so I can lazily <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/info/gawk/gawk.info.Field_Separators.html">extract everything after the
<code>disable=</code></a>.</p>
<p>Next up, because it's a possible list of things that can be disabled, I use
<code>tr</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>tr &quot;,&quot; &quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>to turn any comma-separated list into multiple lines.</p>
<p>Having got to this point, I <code>sort</code> the list, <code>uniq</code> the result, while
prepending a count (<code>-c</code>), and then <code>sort</code> the result again, in reverse and
sorting the numbers based on how a human would read the result (<code>-hr</code>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sort | uniq -c | sort -hr
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's short, sweet and hacky, but does the job quite nicely. From now on, any
time I get curious about which disables I'm leaning on too much, I can use
this to take stock.</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Something I always try to do when I'm coding is be consistent. I feel this
is important. While people's coding standards may differ, I think different
approaches are easier to handle if someone has been consistent with their
style across all of their code.</p>
<p>This also stands for documentation too.</p>
<p>In my current position, I do a <em>lot</em> of Python coding, and one of the things
I like about Python (there are things I don't like too, but that's not for
now) is that it has doc-strings (just like my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">favourite
language</a>). I use them
extensively, ensuring every function and method has some form of
documentation, and generally I use
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> to generate documentation
from those doc-strings.</p>
<p>Early on I was bothered by the fact that, just by the simple act of making
typos, I wasn't keeping the form of the doc-strings consistent. And in this
case it was a <em>really</em> simple thing that was bugging me. Normally, if I'm
writing a single-line doc-string, I'll write like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">one_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is a one-line doc-string.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far, so good. But, if the doc-string is a multi-liner, I prefer the
ending quotes to be on a line of their own, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But, sometimes, by accident, I'd leave a doc-string like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While it's really not a big deal, it would bug me and every time I found one
like this I'd "fix" it.</p>
<p>Eventually, it bugged me enough that I decided I was going to write a little
tool to find all such instances in my code and report them. My first
approach was to think "I could just do this with some regexp magic", <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">which
was really a bad idea</a>. Then I
though, I know, I should use this as an excuse to to play with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">Python's ast
library</a>.</p>
<p>That worked really well! I had <a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck/blob/dc5052002690b1f898ccd68f815cdedbe9172b74/pydscheck">the first version of the
code</a>
up and running in no time. It was simple but did the job. It ran through
Python code I threw at it and alerted me to both missing doc-strings, and
doc-strings with the ending I didn't like.</p>
<p>That served me for a while, until one day I realised that it wasn't quite
doing the job correctly; it was only really looking at top-level functions
and top-level methods in classes. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, I'll
define functions within functions, and I feel they deserve documentation
too. So then I modified the code to ensure it walked every part of the AST.</p>
<p>Since then, when I've run into new things and had new ideas, <code>pydscheck</code> has
grown and grown. I've added checks that all mentioned parameters have a
type; I've added checks that any function/method that returns something
actually documents the return value; I've added checks that any
documentation of a returned value includes its type; I've added checks that
any function or method that yields a value documents that fact; I've added
checks that ensure that every parameter is documented in some way.</p>
<p>Each time I've done this it's helped uncover issues in my code's
documentation that could be cleaner, and it's also given me a pet project to
slowly better understand Python's AST.</p>
<p>It could be that there are better tools out there, I'd have thought that a
good doc-string linting tool would be something someone had already written.
But this time around I was happy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> it because I needed a
fun learning exercise that would also have some benefits for my day-to-day
work.</p>
<p>I'll caveat this with the fact that it's very particular to how I work and
how I like my documentation to look, but if it sounds useful, here it is:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck">https://github.com/davep/pydscheck</a>.</p>
<p>There's still lots I could do with it. First off I should really properly
package it up so it can be installed as a command line tool via pip. Other
things that would be handy would be to allow some form of customisation of
how it works. I'm sure there's other fun things I can do with it too.</p>
<p>That's part of the fun of having a pet project: you can tinker when you like
and also get benefits from it as you use it.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><em>I'm filing this as a TIL because, while it wasn't T, I did L it very
recently and it was a new trick that impacted on around 25 years if prior
working practice.</em></p>
<p>I think it must have been around 1991 when I first encountered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS">4DOS</a>. While I'd used the odd Unix
shell here and there previously, it'd only been in passing. It was 4DOS that
first introduced me to the power of aliases on the command line. Many of the
aliases I set up and used in 4DOS still remain with me to this day, on
GNU/Linux and macOS, in some form or another.</p>
<p>I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone reading this why aliases and cool and
handy and pretty much vital if you do lots of work on the command line.</p>
<p>And then, a couple or so weeks ago, as a very recent convert to
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>, I discovered the
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#abbr"><code>abbr</code></a> command. At
first glance it didn't seem to make much sense. It was like
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#alias"><code>alias</code></a>, only it
expanded what you typed rather than acted as a command in its own right.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging and some of it started to make sense. One thing that
really won me over -- and while it's something that doesn't directly impact
on me -- was the argument that it allows for a far more transparent command
history; especially if you're likely to use a transcript of a shell session
in a place where people might not know or have access to your aliases.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a position where you have loads of handy and cool aliases,
but you also need to record what you've done so other people can follow your
work (does it show that I sit amongst people who maintain lab notebooks?);
it seems like it would be a bit of a bother needing to record all of the
aliases in your own work environment up front. Without that information few
people will be able to make sense of the recorded commands, with that
information they'd still need to double-check what each command does.</p>
<p>So imagine an alias that, when used, expands in place. Then you'd get all of
the benefit of aliases while also having a full and readable record of what
you <em>actually</em> did.</p>
<p>Seems neat!</p>
<p>Here's a silly example. For a long time I've carried around an alias called
<code>greedy</code> that runs something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's pretty straightforward: I'm using <code>du</code> to get a sense of which
directories are using what space, and then using <code>sort</code> to make a
worst-to-best-offender list out of it. So I could use an alias:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">greedy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;du -hs * | sort -rh&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The only downside to this is that, any time I run it, if I were to record
the shell session and make it available for someone else to read, they'd
just see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>greedy
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, with an abbreviation rather than an alias, I'd type <code>greedy</code> but as
soon as I hit <code>Enter</code> it'd get expanded to something anyone could read and
follow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is far from the only benefit of abbreviations; for most people it
probably isn't one of the most important ones, but I find it neat and
compelling and this alone drove me to rework almost all of my aliases as
abbreviations.</p>
<p>Having done that, I get other benefits too. For example, fish (like other
shells) has good support for argument completion for well-known commands.
The problem is, if you alias such a command, you don't get that completion.
With an abbreviation though you do! All you need to do is type the
abbreviation, hit <code>space</code> and it'll expand to the underlying command and
then the full range of completion can happen.</p>
<p>There's also one last reason why I like abbreviations over aliases, and it's
kind of a silly one, but in a good way. It's actually fun to see what you
type magically expand as you do things, it makes you look like you can type
even faster than you normally can! ;-)</p>
<p>PS: If you've never tried <code>fish</code> before and you're curious, it's easy to
<a href="https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/">try in your browser</a>.</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p><code>gh.fish</code>, which <a href="/2019/10/20/fg-fish.html">I wrote about yesterday</a>,
actually sprang from something I initially wrote for Emacs. I'm often
spending my time switching between Emacs and the command line (which is fast
and easy -- I normally work on macOS and have Emacs and
<a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> running full screen, and I can switch
between them without ever taking my hands off the keyboard), so it makes
sense to have some handy commands repeated in both places.</p>
<p>So, originally, I'd written
<a href="https://github.com/davep/gitweb.el"><code>gitweb.el</code></a> to open the current repo's
"forge" in the web browser.</p>
<p>As with the fish version, how it works is quite simple. I use
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Synchronous-Processes.html"><code>shell-command-to-string</code></a>
to call git and find the origin URL for the current repo, and then
manipulate it a bit to turn it into a normal browser-friendly URL. Finally,
if I get something workable, I use
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Browse_002dURL.html"><code>browser-url</code></a>
to have the resulting page open in the browsing environment of choice.</p>
<p>I have the command <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/8f1be3a03e4be98155571939fe5d6fbb54de487f/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L51-L54">bound to a key combination that's similar to the ones I
use with magit and
forge</a>,
so in terms of muscle-memory it's easy for me to remember what to press when
I quickly want to skip over from a magit view to the repo forge itself.</p>
<p>Similar to what I wrote <a href="/2019/10/19/pypath-el.html">a couple of days back</a>,
I think this again illustrates how handy Emacs is as a work environment.
While it's absolutely true that there are other development environments out
there that offer similar extensibility, Emacs is the one I'm comfortable
with, and it has a <em>long</em> history of offering this.</p></div>

      <div><p>These days <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> is my shell of choice. I started
out with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> back in the 1990s, went
through a bit of a
<a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>/<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> phase, but
earlier this year finally settled on fish.</p>
<p>At some point I might write a post about my fish config, and why fish works
well for me. But that's an idea for another time.</p>
<p>In this post I thought I'd share a little snippet of code that can come in
handy now and again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find myself inside a git repo, in the shell, and I want to get
to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29">forge</a>" for
that repo. This is most often either on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, or in
a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/">company-local installation of GitLab</a>.
To get there quickly I wrote
<a href="https://gist.github.com/davep/3bac3b30e45a3560c265150e609219db"><code>gh.fish</code></a>:</p>

<p>The idea is pretty simple: I see if the repo has an origin of some
description and, if it has, I <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#string">slice and dice
it</a> into something
that looks like the URL you'd expect to find for a GitHub or GitLab repo.
Finally I use
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#open"><code>open</code></a> to open the
URL in the environment's browser of choice.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>One of the things I really like about coding with Emacs is how I can easily
identify a repeated task and turn it into a command in my environment,
saving me a load of work down the line.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el"><code>pypath.el</code></a> is one such example.</p>
<p>In my day job I write a lot of Django code. As part of that, I write a good
number of unit tests too. Sometimes I'll write the tests as I'm writing the
code they test, other times I'm writing them afterwards; it all really
depends on where my head's at and how the code is flowing.</p>
<p>When I'm writing those tests, I often want to test them as I go. Given that
starting up a test session can take a while, and given that running all the
tests in the system can take a while, it's really handy if I can run that
single test I'm working on.</p>
<p>This is easy enough with Django. In my work environment it's normally
something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>./manage.py<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">test</span><span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span>app.test.some.sub.module.TestClass.test_method
</code></pre></div>

<p>Only... typing out the:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">some</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test_method</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>part is a bit of a pain. Sure, once you've typed it the once you can use
your shell of choice (mine being <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> and on
occasion
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">eshell</a>)
to recall it from history, but typing it out the first time is the annoying
part.</p>
<p>So this was the point where I took 1/2 hour or so to code up
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pypath.el"><code>pypath.el</code></a> to solve the problem for
me. It gives me two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pypath</code>: which simply places the dotted path of the <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/python-info-current-defun.html">current
  "defun"</a>,
  within the context of being part of a Django system, into the clipboard
  buffer.</li>
<li><code>pypath-django-test</code>: which works similar to the above but places the
  whole Django testing command into the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above, I can work on a test, hit the latter command above, flip to
my command line, paste and I'm running the test.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm sure there's plenty of other handy ways to do this. Doubtless
there's work environments where the test can be run right there, in the edit
buffer, without flipping away, and which takes into account the fact that
there's a pipenv-managed virtual environment involved, etc. If there is,
that's great, but I don't think it'd work with how I work.</p>
<p>And that's one of the things I really love about Emacs, and why it's still
my work environment after almost 25 years of on and off use: with very
little work on my part I can create a couple of commands that work exactly
how I need them to. While it's great to create <a href="https://melpa.org/">generally-useful code for
Emacs that lots of people benefit from</a>, sometimes the
real value is that <a href="https://blog.davep.org/delpa/">you can code up your own particular quirk and just get
on with stuff</a>.</p>
<p>To conclude: this post isn't to show off <code>pypath.el</code>; really this post is to
sing the praises of Emacs and why it still works so well for me after all
these years.</p></div>
