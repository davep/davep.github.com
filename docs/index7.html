      <div><p><a href="/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html#home-pod-stuck-installing">A couple of weeks
back</a>
I mentioned home my main HomePod had got stuck installing 16.6 of the
software that runs it. This situation persisted for days after writing that
post and I kept promising myself that I was going to see if I could unstick
it by removing it from the Home, doing a factory reset and adding it back
again.</p>
<p>Of course, during the week that followed, I never got round to that. You can
imagine what it's like: no time in the morning, and by the time I get home
in the evening I want to watch TV and use the HomePod as the speaker for the
Apple TV, I don't want to be doing tech support shit.</p>
<p>The following weekend... yeah, I kinda forgot.</p>
<p>So, here I am, a couple of Saturdays on, it's early morning, I've had
breakfast and I'm having coffee and I think it's the perfect time to do
this. I hope the Home app my on iPad and... it's sorted!</p>
<p><img alt="HomePod all good again" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 07.25.44.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, yeah, it looks like it somehow managed to unstick itself in the end. A
quick test of some of the issues I was seeing suggested there was still an
issue, for example asking for the temperature in the bedroom would still
result in a <em>"working on it"</em> reply followed by it telling me it wasn't
responding. A quick reset seems to have fixed that.</p>
<p>I guess it's good to know: if it happens again, it'll keep on working as the
speaker for my Apple TV, and it'll eventually sort itself out even if I
don't muck about with a hard reset.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>And I'm off! This morning I spent a good amount of time going through the
sources for the old version of <a href="http://www.davep.org"><code>davep.org</code></a> and
removing everything that won't be needed any more, and also building up a
rough TODO list of things I may want to recreate as content.</p>
<p>With that done, <a href="/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html">as mentioned earlier
today</a>, I started work on
building the site around Pelican. Pretty quickly though I started to feel
that that was going to be a bad choice. While Pelican felt like a <em>perfect</em>
fit for this blog -- mainly because it seems to be very blog-oriented -- it
was feeling a bit clunky for a general website that would have a handful of
static pages at best; likely something I wouldn't be updating too often.</p>
<p>So I put it aside and went on with my morning, doing normal Friday domestic
stuff like the weekly supermarket shop. It was while I was out doing that
that I realised the obvious answer: use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">what we use for the Textual
docs</a> and what's been used for
<a href="https://label.dev/"><code>label.dev</code></a>: <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/">Material for
MkDocs</a>!</p>
<p>I've just spent about 40 minutes after lunch kicking that off and it was
really straightforward. Of course the result is horrifically cookie-cutter
in terms of its look -- such is the way that <code>mkdocs-material</code> sites end up
looking out of the box -- but I don't much care about that; what's important
is that I've got a placeholder page in place, and I've quickly built a
framework for writing and publishing the content.</p>
<p>So that's the plan: now that the welcome page is in place and there's
<em>something</em> on my domain that looks like a working website again I can start
to slowly drag in old content in a new format. Heck, if I'm careful I might
even be able to retain some of the old URLs!</p>
<p>Longer-term plans might involve finally sorting out <code>https</code> support (yes,
even today, my site is <code>http</code>-only), and perhaps adding some sort of RSS
feed so there's a record of when changes are made.</p>
<p>After that... hopefully that'll be about it and perhaps the website will
last another 22 years running on top of the same engine (actually that part
should be easier because the "engine" is now local and it generates a static
site).</p>
<p>The question then becomes who'll last longer, the site or me?</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had <code>davep.org</code> since very late 1999. Initially it started as a domain
used just for email; while I did have a website, around that time it was
still hosted on my then-ISPs hosting service, with a mirror on a friend's
web server.</p>
<p>A year or so later I finally did a proper revamp of my website and finally
settled on <code>www.davep.org</code> as the place to point people to. I <em>think</em>, when
I made that move, that's when I decided to write my own website engine in
php. It was fun. It worked. I didn't want to code backend stuff (I don't
think the backend vs frontend distinction was even a thing we were talking
about then) so hacking it together in an unholy mix of ruby to generate
various static files that live in the filesystem and then php to turn them
into actual HTML made sense.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p><img alt="The earliest version of davep.org I can find" src="/attachments/2023/08/11/davep-org.png#centre"></p>
<p>I heavily maintained the site for many years; keeping the same engine,
tweaking the styles, adding features and content. I figure some time around
2013 or 2014 I probably stopped being quite so active in messing with it,
and then in the last 5 or 6 years I've pretty much neglected it.</p>
<p>The neglect shows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... php has changed. Quiet a lot. It's one of those languages I
used back in the day and pay no attention to. Then earlier this week I
noticed that there must have been an update on the host and huge parts of my
site broke, lots of content missing, pretty much useless and dead in the
water.</p>
<p>I did briefly think about breaking out the latest and greatest php locally,
setting things up to investigate what's going on, and seeing if I could
breathe some more life into it; but really what's the point?</p>
<p>So after all these years I'm finally admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Right now, on the home page, I've just got a placeholder saying that bitrot
finally ate my website and that I'm going to start again from scratch.
That's my plan: given that <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html">I had a good experience moving this blog over to
Pelican</a> I
think I'm going to build a new <code>www.davep.org</code> with Pelican. Where possible
I'll try and drag some of the old content over, but I'm also going to use
this opportunity to have a proper digital spring clean.</p>
<p>There's no planned timescale for this, but this morning I've spent an hour
or so over coffee, branching the repo for the site and pruning out all the
stuff I know I won't need and don't want.</p>
<p>I'll try and drop the odd update in here as things progress.</p></div>

      <div><p>I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)">Little Shop of
Horrors</a> for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.</p>
<p>And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.</p>
<p>Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.</p>
<p>So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="Poser for Little Shop of Horrors" src="/attachments/2023/08/10/IMG_2652.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would</a>, this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you <em>seen</em> how much there is on offer?).</p>
<p>So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors">a performance of Little Shop of
Horrors</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>Following on from <a href="/2023/08/08/strange-obsidian-sync-issue.html">the previous
entry</a>, where I outlined a
weird problem I'd started having with syncing Obsidian via iCloud, I finally
decided to sit down and try and work out the exact flow of the problem.
Today, for example, I'd created an entry in two different vaults on my phone
while on the bus into work, and when I got to my desk the vault I use on my
work machine had updated.</p>
<p>However, when I got home this evening, the vault for my personal stuff
hadn't updated on my home Mac Mini. I tried a few edits, in both vaults, on
the iPhone, and nothing came through to the Mac.</p>
<p>So... before I started really diving into things I decided to <em>"turn it off
and on again"</em> -- the iPhone that is -- and when it came back I ran up
Obsidian, which told me it wasn't allowed to access my iCloud drive!</p>
<p>I took a moment to go into the settings to try and figure it out, didn't
find what I wanted right away, then got to thinking that perhaps some of the
phone's services were still spinning up, so I ran Obsidian up again (after
killing it).</p>
<p>Sure enough, this time, it saw my vaults. With both vaults open on my Mac I
made edits to open entries and <strong>the edits started to flow</strong>.</p>
<p>So, yup, looks like it was a simple case of <em>"turn it off and on again"</em>.</p>
<p>Apple: <code>#ItJustWorks</code>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since October last year I've been getting into using
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Not that heavily, not to the extent some
people do, but just as a way to keep a daily journal of work-related things.
Each day at <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textual HQ</a>
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/about-us/">we</a> finish off with a chat about how
our day has gone, stuff we're wondering about, etc, etc... So I don't lose
tack of what I've been up to I keep notes and Obsidian is how I do that.</p>
<p>One of the things I really like about it is how I can have iPhone, iPad and
macOS versions on the go and have it all sync via iCloud. It generally works
well.</p>
<p>But in the last couple of days I've noted the oddest problem, and I've yet
to pin down the exact flow. But it seems to be this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I create or edit a note on my iPhone, it doesn't turn up on my Mac.</li>
<li>If I create or edit a note on my Mac, it turns up on my iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>think</em> I might have seen variations on that theme but I've not made
careful note -- normally I'm made aware of it when I'm trying to get
something done.</p>
<p>What's super weird is this: on the iPhone, if I create a note, and then go
into the <code>Files</code> app and look at the iCloud folders for Obsidian, the file
isn't there! It's there in Obsidian itself, I can move it about, edit it,
etc, etc... but it's not in the "vault" as seen from the <code>Files</code> app.</p>
<p>It's the last part that has be really puzzled.</p>
<p>If I get to the bottom of this I'll try and remember to write up what I
find. I suspect I'm going to need some proper clear time, without other
distractions, and experiment with all the edit and sync options and see what
works and what fails.</p></div>

<p>I've lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside
form the odd show here and there, I've never really <em>done</em> the Fringe. As
in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn't quite
allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every
year I've been up here I've managed one show, at least, but this year I want
to try and make myself get to a few.</p>
<p>Maybe one per week. Possibly.</p>
<p>Might not happen, but I'm going to try. What can I say? I don't live <em>in</em>
Edinburgh, I'm not a big "be out amongst people" kind of person, and the
activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little
part of Scotland is a constant battle.</p>
<p>But this year I'm going to try my best.</p>
<p>This evening I've booked a ticket for an artist I've been a fan of since the
1990s: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harper">Nick Harper</a>. I saw Nick
quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I <em>think</em> 2009 might be
the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat
(again, life stuff). So seeing that <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/5-nights-in-harperspace">he's playing here for a few
days</a> was
something I could not ignore.</p>
<p>This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something
kinda sociable. I'm sure he'll be mad at me most of the day it's happening,
but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he'll be thankful.</p>
<p>Right now, at this moment... I'm rather looking forward to it.</p></div>

      <div><p>I have three HomePods. I have a Mini in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.
I then have one of the newer-gen "big" HomePods in the living room, which
amongst other things is the speaker for my Apple TV device (yeah, I'm kinda
Apple all over the place these days).</p>
<p>This week there was an update to the software, updating to 16.6. The two
Minis updated just fine. The big one, however, days later...</p>
<p><img alt="HomePod stuck installing the update" src="/attachments/2023/07/29/HomePodStuck.png"></p>
<p>It's been like this all the time since the update turned up. I've tried a
reboot from the Home app. I've tried pulling the plug and plugging it in
again. Nope. It just keeps sitting there like this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... it's working (more or less) fine. It's still playing music.
It's still being the speaker for the Apple TV. It still answers most
questions and performs most commands (most of the commands I give it are to
add stuff to my Reminders).</p>
<p>On occasion if I ask it questions about other devices in the apartment
(<em>"hey siri, what's the temperature in the bedroom?"</em>) it'll do the
<em>"working on it"</em> thing and then give up saying the thing wasn't responding.
That seems to be about the worst of it.</p>
<p>Having checked this online it looks like, annoyingly, the one option I have
left is to do a full reset, removing it from my Home, doing a factory reset,
and then setting it up again. I'm sure it's something that'll take 10
minutes or so; but it's an annoyance.</p>

      <div><p>I can't quite remember <em>where</em> I found this this week, I think it might have
been via a comment on some article on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">orange
site</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but I stumbled on a really
handy bit of free (as in beer) software called <a href="https://quiche.works/reader/">Quiche
Reader</a>.</p>
<p>It's really simple and I feel <em>exactly</em> the sort of thing I need. Over the
years I've tried all sorts of "save to read later" tools and systems; be it
things like Pocket, or tools now built into the browser these days, even
adding URLs to <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> (back
when I used that) or (these days) Apple Reminders.</p>
<p>Nothing ever quite stuck. Normally I'd end up slapping stuff to read into
these systems and then never reading them.</p>
<p>Quiche Reader, so far, feels like the perfect approach.</p>
<p><img alt="Quiche Reader in action" src="/attachments/2023/07/27/quiche-reader.png"></p>
<p>It's quite simple: if I see something I want to read a bit later I save it
into the application (which will sync to my other devices via iCloud). Then,
when I go to Quiche Reader, I <em>have</em> to read the article or delete it and
move on. This is sort of what I'd do anyway, saving stuff up for months on
end until one day I'd declare saved reading bankruptcy and then start the
whole cycle again.</p>
<p>Now I can look at the saved article stack and I'm forced to either read the
thing, or be honest with myself that if I'm not gonna read it now, I'm
probably never going to.</p>
<p>It does have a "pause" facility (or something like that, I forget the name)
where you can throw an article to the back of the queue; but even then that
means it'll keep popping back to the top again.</p>
<p>I'll see how it goes; but so far I feel like this is the best <em>"I'll save
this to read later"</em> tool I've found yet.</p>

      <div><p>Anyone who was (un)lucky enough to follow me on Twitter back in 2020 will
know that, starting January 1st that year, I set about losing weight. At the
time I was <em>very</em> overweight and wanted to get into some sort of healthy
state. By August that year I'd managed to drop 30kg and hit and then went a
wee way under my goal.</p>
<p>These days I'm back up a wee bit. Not much: generally about 5kg or so above
that goal, most of that having turned up on the last 7 or 8 months (not
exactly coincidental that it's happened in conjunction with the new job, the
new work location, and the new commute). While it's no real cause for
concern -- I'm still generally careful and still get plenty of exercise
(normally walk around 35km a week, run 20km, get my 10k steps in every day)</p>
<p>About a week back I decided that it was time to give myself a bit of
breathing room, to try and at least drop a couple or kg; so with that in
mind I set a lower daily calorie goal in my tacking app.</p>
<p>When recording my weight first thing this morning (yes, I'm one of those
people who records it every day and have for a few years -- it makes for
interesting data!), this is what my calorie/stats tracker had to say:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my calorie and weight tracking app" src="/attachments/2023/07/21/IMG_2475.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I guess it's putting a positive spin in things? (for the record, I'm 5.3kg
<em>above</em> my absolute goal).</p></div>
