    <p>While it does seem that they're a little out of fashion these days, in some
circles anyway, I'm still an avid fan of <code>make</code> and make files. Even in
environments where I don't need a <code>Makefile</code> to actually build anything,
I'll use one (or more) to help create handy shortcuts for getting stuff
done.</p>
<p>Looking at the main <code>Makefile</code> for one of my major work projects, there's 45
targets that help fire off various jobs (all of them <a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html">self-documenting using
a variation on an approach I read a while
back</a>).</p>
<p>In most cases the targets aren't real targets. That's to say, they don't
build the thing they're called. They are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html">phony
targets</a>.
So, as makes sense, I make a point of marking them all as such. I follow the
convention that has the <code>.PHONY</code> marker appear on the line before the
target; this feels cleaner to me and easier to follow and maintain.</p>
<p>But.... I'm lazy. And I use Emacs. Typing out <code>.PHONY foo</code> all the time
feels like far too much work. So, some time ago, I quickly threw together
<a href="https://github.com/davep/make-phony.el"><code>make-phony.el</code></a>.</p>
<p>With this I could be <em>really</em> lazy. I could type out the <code>Makefile</code> target
and then, with my cursor on it, press a key combination and have the
<code>.PHONY</code> marker put in place.</p>
<p>Does it save much time? Yeah, probably not really. But it was a fun little
exercise and an excuse to write a little bit of Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>There's one thing I made a point of doing in the heart of this too: using
<code>rx</code>. For anyone who doesn't know of it, think of it as a very Lispy way of
writing regular expressions. I won't even try and explain it all here
<a href="http://francismurillo.github.io/2017-03-30-Exploring-Emacs-rx-Macro/">because others have done an excellent job
already</a>.
What I will do is say this: if you're in the habit of writing some Emacs
Lisp, or even tinkering with your configuration, and you find yourself
writing a regular expression, consider looking at <code>rx</code> -- it's well worth
the time to get to know it.</p>
<p>Slowly, as time goes on, I'm weeding out "vanilla" regular expressions from
my config and code and moving over to using <code>rx</code>. I feel, quite rightly I
think, that <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b3185a1dbaa0a16f540465844b84c5e1c6a77180/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L117-L126">something like
this</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rx</span>
<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">or</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; Ignore hidden files.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">bol</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; I never want to edit the desktop.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Desktop/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; Ignore compiled files.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">or</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;pyc&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;elc&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.egg-info/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is much easier to write, read and maintain, than this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;\\(^\\.\\)\\|\\(Desktop/$\\)\\|\\(\\.\\(?:\\(?:\\(?:el\\|py\\)c\\)\\)$\\)\\|\\(\\.egg-info/$\\)&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>I mean, even <em>if</em> the regular expression above can be written in a more
efficient way (and I imagine it can), as someone working in a Lisp
environment, I'd much sooner write and work with the <code>rx</code> version.</p>
