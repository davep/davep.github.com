  <div>
    <p>I first got into Python in the mid-to-late 1990s. It's so far back that I
think the copy of <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/">Programming
Python</a> that I have (sadly in
storage at the moment) might be a first edition. I probably fell out of the
habit of using Python some time in the early 2000s (that was when I met
Ruby). It was only 22 months ago that I started using Python a <em>lot</em> thanks
to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">a change of
employer</a>.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, much had changed in the 15+ years since I'd last
written a line of Python in anger. So, early on, I made a point of making
<a href="https://www.pylint.org/">Pylint</a> part of my development process. All my
projects have a <code>make lint</code> make target. All of my projects lint the code
when I push to <code>master</code> in the company GitLab instance. These days I even
use <a href="https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a> to keep me honest as I
write my code; mostly gone are the days where I don't know of problems until
I do a <code>make lint</code>.</p>
<p>Leaning on Pylint in the early days of my new position made for a great
Python refresher for me. Now, I still lean on it to make sure I don't make
daft mistakes.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Pylint and I don't always agree. And that's fine. For example, I really
can't stand Pylint's approach to whitespace, and that is a hill I'll happily
die on. Ditto the obsession with lines being no more than 80 characters wide
(120 should be fine thanks). As such any project's <code>.pylintrc</code> has, as a
bare minimum, this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[FORMAT]</span>
<span class="na">max-line-length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">120</span>

<span class="k">[MESSAGES CONTROL]</span>
<span class="na">disable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">bad-whitespace</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Beyond that though, aside from one or two extras that pertain to particular
projects, I'm happy with what Pylint complains about.</p>
<p>There are exceptions though. There are times, simply due to the nature of
the code involved, that Pylint's insistence on code purity isn't going to
work. That's where I use its inline <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html#block-disables">block disabling
feature</a>.
It's handy and helps keep things clean (I won't deploy code that doesn't
pass 10/10), but there is always this nagging doubt: if I've disabled a
warning in the code, am I ever going to come back and revisit it?</p>
<p>To help me think about coming back to such disables now and again, I thought
it might be interesting to write a tool that'll show which warnings I
disable most. It resulted in <a href="https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/dd2721e0565928b4145698a42c9c74e4534c578a/conf.d/abbr.d/python.fish#L5">this fish
abbr</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr<span class="w"> </span>-g<span class="w"> </span>pylintshame<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;rg --no-messages \&quot;pylint:disable=\&quot; | awk &#39;BEGIN{FS=\&quot;disable=\&quot;;}{print \$2}&#39; | tr \&quot;,\&quot; \&quot;\n\&quot; | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea here being that it produces a "Pylint hall of shame", something
like this:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>To break the pipeline down:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rg --no-messages &quot;pylint:disable=&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>First off, I use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> (if you
don't, you might want to have a good look at it -- I find it amazingly
handy) to find everywhere in the code in and below the current directory
(the <code>--no-messages</code> switch just stops any file I/O errors that might result
from permission issues -- they're not interesting here) that contains a line
that has a Pylint block disable (if you tend to format yours differently,
you'll need to tweak the regular expression, of course).</p>
<p>I then pipe it through <code>awk</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">awk</span> <span class="s">&#39;BEGIN{FS=&quot;disable=&quot;;}{print $2}&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>so I can lazily <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/info/gawk/gawk.info.Field_Separators.html">extract everything after the
<code>disable=</code></a>.</p>
<p>Next up, because it's a possible list of things that can be disabled, I use
<code>tr</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>tr &quot;,&quot; &quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>to turn any comma-separated list into multiple lines.</p>
<p>Having got to this point, I <code>sort</code> the list, <code>uniq</code> the result, while
prepending a count (<code>-c</code>), and then <code>sort</code> the result again, in reverse and
sorting the numbers based on how a human would read the result (<code>-hr</code>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sort | uniq -c | sort -hr
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's short, sweet and hacky, but does the job quite nicely. From now on, any
