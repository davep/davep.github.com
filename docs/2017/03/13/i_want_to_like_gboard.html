    <p>I want to like Gboard. On paper it looks really rather good. It's a keyboard
from Google, it ties in with your account, it syncs things, it has clever
searching for emoji and gifs and the like... what's not to like?</p>
<p>Problem is, I've been a user of SwiftKey since around 2011 (I think it was).
I'm very used to how SwiftKey works and it also contains a lot of handy
things. I like that it has smart completion, that it learns how I type a bit
skewed and that it takes this into account, that I can turn off the fancy
swipe typing and instead make use of handy gestures like swipe-left to
delete a word. I like some of the themes a lot.</p>
<p>Into the mix comes my iPad, which I use on occasion. The standard Apple
keyboard is horrible and, sadly, I find SwiftKey on iOS just as frustrating.
It seems to lack enough key features there (especially the word deletion
gesture, as far as I can tell) that it's also a bit annoying. My dream of a
consistent typing experience across all devices just wasn't happening --
until I found Gboard on iOS.</p>
<p>That felt almost right. And from what I could tell it worked almost exactly
the same on iOS and Android. So it felt like a good time to try and force
myself to use Gboard on my Google Pixel and Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I'm just not getting on with it. It's okay. It's not bad.
It's just... not good. I'm finding that it lacks enough useful things that
it's a frustrating experience. Little things like: when I enter Google
Search, there's no word completion in the keyboard (SwiftKey has that); the
word deletion gesture (swipe left from the backspace key) seems very
hit-and-miss; the most obvious completion for a word sometimes appears in
the middle slot but, other times, in the left slot. And so on.</p>
<p>Nothing huge. Nothing that's a show-stopper. But a handful of a little
things that make me miss the comfortable home that is SwiftKey.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it does have some very handy and cleaver features too.
The searching for emoji -- including showing them up as word completions --
is rather clever. The gif-search thing is all kinds of fun too (mostly used
to annoy the hell out
of <a href="https://twitter.com/VolcanicArts">my son on twitter</a>).</p>
<p>None of those quite make up for the bits I miss from SwiftKey though.</p>
<p>All that said, I've being making a point of pushing on with Gboard, thinking
that most of my issues might just be because I'm too used to my "old home".
Mostly this was working well, until I noticed something this morning. While
reading the description for Gboard I noticed this handy thing in the "Pro
Tips" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sync your learned words across devices to improve suggestions (enable in
Gboard Settings→ Dictionary → Sync learned words).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful! I'd assumed that this was the case anyway -- it's Google after all
-- but it's good to know I can ensure it's turned on. So I went to turn it
on. This is what I found:</p>
<p><img alt="Gboard WTF" src="/attachments/2017/03/13/Screenshot_20170313-072359.png"></p>
<p>What the hell Google? Sure, I do have a Gsuite account on my phone -- as in
various apps have access to a Gsuite account (Gmail, Drive, etc...) -- but
it's not the primary account on my phone and it's not the account I'd really
want to be doing the dictionary sync with anyway. If I've got dictionary
sync I want it tied to the keyboard no matter the app I'm in, and no matter
the account I'm using in that app. I want the keyboard to be tied to a
specific account when it comes to sync (just like SwiftKey does it).</p>
<p>This, I think, is a show-stopper for me.</p>
<p>I can overlook the other niggles, I can learn to cope with it not being
quite so perfect in some situations; but the blanket inability to do
something as simple as cloud-sync the predictions and learn from how I type
-- things that are, these days, central to what Google's about -- it's
frankly stupid.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going to have to keep Gboard as a backup keyboard for those
times when I need to find the perfect gif.</p>
