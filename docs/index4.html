  <div>
      <div><p>I don't think I've mentioned it before on this blog, but some time back I
decided it would be fun to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> to
write a Mandelbrot explorer (simple Mandelbrot explorers have been another
one of my favourite <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">known problem to try an unknown
thing</a> problems). Doing it in the
terminal seemed like a fun little hack. I started off with creating
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas"><code>textual-canvas</code></a> and then built
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot"><code>textual-mandelbrot</code></a> on top
of that.</p>
<p>Not too long back <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/15/textual-0370-adds-a-command-palette/">I added a "command palette" to
Textual</a>
(I'd prefer to call it a minibuffer, but I get that that's not fashionable
these days), but so far I've not used it in any of my own projects; earlier
today I thought it could be fun to add it to <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mandelbrot commands in action" src="/attachments/2023/09/29/mandelbrot-commands.png#centre"></p>
<p>Most of the commands I've added are trivial and really better covered by
(and are covered by) keystrokes, but it was a good test and a way to show
off how to create a command provider.</p>
<p>Having started this I can see some more useful things to add: for example it
might be interesting to add a facility where you can bookmark a specific
location, zoom level, iteration value, etc, and revisit later. The command
palette would feel like a great way to pull back those bookmarks.</p>
<p>What I really liked though was how <em>easy</em> this was to do. <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot/blob/main/textual_mandelbrot/commands.py">The code to make
the commands
available</a>
is pretty trivial and, I believe, easy to follow. Although I do say so
myself I think I managed to design a very accessible API for this.</p>
<p>There's more I'd like to add to that (the Textual command palette itself, I
mean), of course; this was just the start. Support for commands that accept
and prompt for arguments would be a neat and obvious enhancement (especially
if done in a way that's reminiscent of how commands could be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager">CLIM</a> -- I
remember <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-cldict/">really liking</a> how you
could create self-documenting and self-completing commands in that).</p>
<p>All in good time...</p></div>

      <div><p>As someone who started out in the Android ecosystem when it came to smart
phones -- starting out with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> and going through a few
different phones before settling on Pixels (until I finally jumped ship to
iOS in 2020) -- I have to admit that there's always been something nice
about the design of iPhones. iOS, less so... My first exposure to iOS was
<a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">back in 2015 when I got an iPod</a>,
and I wasn't terribly impressed. It looked okay, but it felt so far behind
Android in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>Much has changed and improved since then. These days, 3 years into being
totally consumed by the Apple ecosystem (one day I should write a post about
how comprehensively I've moved over), I'm won over and I like how iOS works
now.</p>
<p>Except this...</p>
<p><img alt="Bad design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-bad.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>That thing where, when you're in one app, it will show the most useless link
"back" to another app, and in doing so bump the time up and out of the way a
little. Like, seriously, compare it to when the app link thing isn't there:</p>
<p><img alt="Good design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-good.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Once you see it, you can't unsee it.</p>
<p><img alt="Toggle of the two images" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/bad-good-toggle.gif#centre"></p>
<p>After all this time you'd think they would have found a less janky way of
doing this; perhaps even simply removed it (I can't remember the last time I
needed or wanted the ability to go "back" an app like this, especially not
with the bottom-of-screen swipe gesture being a thing). If nothing else
you'd think that, by now, they'd have found a way of doing it that doesn't
look so terrible.</p>
<p>The <em>"eh, let's just shove it here"</em> approach that seems to be on display
here almost reminds me of <a href="/2015/10/07/imac-time-wiggle.html">the "time wiggle" that used to mildly annoy me
back on my iMac</a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Some time around late October or early November last year, around the time I
started working at <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>, I "discovered"
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. While I didn't need another note-taking
application (having gone through Evernote, trying to use
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a>, dabbling with a couple of other things and
finally settling mainly on Apple Notes), I was quite taken by its style and
ubiquity and the fact that it was, at heart, just a bunch of Markdown files.</p>
<p>So quite quickly I started using it; not to replace Apple Notes (which is
still my general note-taking tool of choice), but to keep work notes and a
daily coding journal, the latter coming in useful for the quick end-of-day
meetings we normally have.</p>
<p>One of the things I was quite taken by was the graph. It was interesting and
fun to see how each of my work days related to other work days, and what
subjects kept getting pulled in, etc.</p>
<p>So come the start of this year I had an idea: what would it be like to keep
a personal vault, but one where I track things I've done. Not a journal as
such (I do keep one of those too, have done for many years now, but that's
for other far more important reasons -- perhaps I'll write about that one
day too), just a daily record of stuff I've achieved, stuff I've actually
done, the routine things and the exceptional things?</p>
<p>What would that graph look like?</p>
<p>While it's not the end of this year yet, here's how that's shaping up:</p>
<p><img alt="The main graph" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/MainGraph.png#centre"></p>
<p>Each of the yellow circles is a day, each of the blue ones is a tag of some
sort. As you'd imagine, the size of the circles relates to how often that
item is tagged. So I can see what proportion of my days so far this year
have been tagged with being heavily involved with work:</p>
<p><img alt="Work" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Work.png#centre"></p>
<p>Likewise, if I want to see how many days this year have involved a
significant spot of gaming:</p>
<p><img alt="Gaming" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Gaming.png#centre"></p>
<p>Ditto for days where I've done some coding on pet projects, or even some
personal-time coding relating to work projects (it might be work, but it's
also Free Software and I do like to support FOSS!)</p>
<p><img alt="Coding" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Coding.png#centre"></p>
<p>I sort of have a curated set of tags I apply, but I've not made it a strict
set; if some new situation crops up that calls for a new tag I'll use it.
Mostly though I try and keep the tags pretty general so lots of days can
relate to the same general subject.</p>
<p>Another thing I've done is tag each and every day with the day of the week,
so while it's not really surprising to find that Sunday doesn't dominate
over other days, I can see which days are Sundays and perhaps wander along
the connections and see what I get up to:</p>
<p><img alt="Sunday" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Sunday.png#centre"></p>
<p>I don't quite know what I hope to get out of this, I don't really know if
there's anything useful to be had here at all, but it will be interesting to
look back over it at the end of the year. It also means that I'll have a
directory hierarchy full of Markdown files, all tagged and filled with
information, which I'll be able to <code>grep</code> and slice and dice and count and
perhaps pull into a database and cross-reference with stuff and things.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it's all just really me not having a good use for Obsidian but
inventing one anyway. ;-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since <a href="/2023/09/01/textual-query-sandbox.html">quickly hacking together <code>textual-query-sandbox</code> a few days
back</a>, I've made a bunch of small
changes here and there. While most have been cosmetic and playing with some
ideas, some have also been internal improvements that should make the tool
work better.</p>
<p>The most prominent change is one I pondered in the previous post, where I
thought it might be interesting to have a small collection of playgrounds
grounded together with a <code>TabbedContent</code>. So as of now the tool still has
the original playground which had an emphasis on nested containers:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 1" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-1.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's now a playground with an emphasis on selecting widgets within
containers<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 2" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-2.png#centre"></p>
<p>There's also now a playground that has an emphasis on pulling out widgets
based on ID and classes:</p>
<p><img alt="Playground 3" src="/attachments/2023/09/10/tqs-3.png#centre"></p>
<p>The other change you will notice from the original post is the DOM tree
shown in the bottom right corner. Note that that isn't there to show your
query result (that's the bottom left panel), it's there to help picture how
the DOM in the current playground hangs together, and will hopefully help in
picturing the structure for when you write a query.</p>
<p>I sense there's still a lot of fun things I could add to this, and I'm still
keen on the idea of having the playgrounds "soft coded" in some way, so
people can make their own and load them up.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to try and work on is making the display as useful as
possible. While I think it's actually pretty neat and clear, there's not a
<em>lot</em> of space<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> available to show the playground and the results. Finding
a good balance is an interesting problem.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons this is turning into a really enjoyable tinker
project.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This is, of course, slightly nonsensical wording. Containers <em>are</em>
widgets in Textual. Pretty much everything you see in your terminal is a
widget, even a <code>Screen</code> is a widget.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>A lot of this of course hinges on how big someone's terminal is. I
tend to run a fairly high resolutions with the smallest font I find
readable so my terminal windows are often pretty "big"; other people
tend to have something much smaller in terms of cell with/height.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <div><p>Sometimes I can have an idea for a Textual widget, library or application on
my ideas list for weeks, months even, before I get around to it -- mostly
just due to not having the clear time to make a run at getting it going --
and then other times an idea can pop into my head and it <em>has</em> to be created
there and then. <strong>Has</strong> to be!</p>
<p>This happened yesterday evening.</p>
<p>While the tool I built is something I'd thought of before (back around
November last year I think) it hadn't even made it to my <em>"list of stuff I
should make"</em> that I keep in Apple Reminders; not sure why really. But then
yesterday evening a question cropped up on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Textual Discord
server</a> that related to the subject and I was
reminded of it.</p>
<p>The subject being: <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/">Textual DOM
queries</a>. I like to think that
DOM queries in Textual are pretty easy to do, and well-explained in the
docs, but it's fair to admit that they need a bit of practice first, just
like any powerful tool. So I was reminded that I'd wanted to write a sandbox
application, that would have a practice DOM inside it, an input field to
type in a query, and a way of displaying the results.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-query-sandbox"><code>textual-query-sandbox</code></a>
was born!</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Query Sandbox" src="/attachments/2023/09/01/tqs.png#centre"></p>
<p>In this very first version (which was <em>really</em> quickly put together -- it
was something like 15 minutes to write the main code and then probably 45
minutes tweaking styles, adding all the admin stuff to allow <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-query-sandbox/">deployment to
PyPi</a> and writing the
README) there's an <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/input/"><code>Input</code></a>,
a display of a group of nested containers with different IDs and classes,
and then a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/pretty/"><code>Pretty</code></a> widget
at the bottom to show the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/#query-objects"><code>query</code></a>
result.</p>
<p>If you think this looks like it might be useful to you, it can be installed
using either <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-query-sandbox
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then you can run it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>tqs
</code></pre></div>

<p>At which point load up the Textual query docs, type queries into the input
field, hit enter and see what gets highlighted and which widgets end up in
the result set at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Like I say: this was a quick hack yesterday evening, I think there's a lot
more can go into this. For one thing I think a more interesting practice DOM
would be a good idea, with a good mix of widgets; another thing could be
having a collection of different DOM playgrounds that can be switched
between (a <code>TabbedContent</code> of different playgrounds could be fun here); this
could even be taken further such that the user can create their own
playground DOM to practice against.</p>
<p>Eventually it would be neat if this could be turned into a library that can
be included in a Textual application, as a development-time debug tool, so
that on-the-fly test queries can be made.</p>
<p>For now though, it's started, it's under way, and I think the current
version probably covers 90% of the use cases for something like this; making
for a really quick and easy tool to double-check how to query something.</p></div>

      <div><p>And I'm done! While it did only turn out to be one a week, <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">I pulled it
off</a>, I managed to make it to at
least one Fringe show per week!</p>
<p><img alt="View inside the Roxy" src="/attachments/2023/08/27/IMG_2834.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Yesterday was a full, busy, and hugely enjoyable day. While it could have
just been a dash into town to see the show and back home again, in
conjunction with <a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle">Mariëlle</a> (who <a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html">first
introduced me to the Mythos show</a>)
we arranged to go watch Oppenheimer first (amazing, easily the fastest any
combined 3 hours have passed for me -- I'm not even going to try and write
up anything about this, other than I was utterly enthralled by the movie
from start to end), grab some dinner, <em>then</em> go and see <em>Mythos: Ragnarok</em>.</p>
<p>With a wee bit of shopping thrown in along the way.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I first saw Ragnarok last year. Then they were in
a fairly small venue, with a pretty full crowd. At the end they talked about
how the first night they'd played the audience had been a single person;
over the nights of the run it had slowly grown, and by the end of the run
(we went on the last night) it was getting properly busy.</p>
<p>This year they were in a <a href="https://assemblyfestival.com/venues/61_assembly-roxy"><em>much</em> bigger
place</a>, with a lot
more seating, and the house was full. This did make it feel a little less
intimate than last year, and also last year we were sat all around the
stage, which worked well for the performance; this time around it was a more
traditional stage at the front, seating all on one side thing. I was really
pleased for them that they were in a much bigger place, but I did miss the
layout from last year.</p>
<p>As for the show itself... just as fantastic. There seemed to have been some
tweaks and changes to how the story was done over what I remember from last
year, but mainly it was the same. The energy in the performance was
incredible, and the comedy was spot on, with a lot of nods and winks to the
audience. This is the part that I think I enjoy most: they know what they
have, they know what they're doing, they know what they have on offer. It's
a high-energy play performed by stunt people.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>

<p></center></p>
<p>As I write this there's one last show, I believe, tonight; so the chances of
anyone reading this and getting to see it are very remote. But if they're
back next year, and you're reading this near then and wondering about Fringe
shows, do it! Really, do it. You won't regret it.</p>
<p>I'll be going again. No question.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Almost <a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html">seven years ago</a> I took
up maintaining an ad-hoc photoblog again. I say again because I'd had one
once before. I'd kicked that off back in the late 200xs, with my little HTC
Magic, and hosted it on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous">Posterous</a>. Eventually Posterous
was shut down, mostly because the company (or at least the team behind it))
had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424063619/http://blog.posterous.com/big-news">bought up by
Twitter</a>.
When kicking off the blog this time I decided on a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd host it on Blogger.com; it had been around for long enough, and of
  course <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google could be trusted to keep something that big up and running
  for good</a>.</li>
<li>I'd keep multiple backup copies of the images and file them in useful ways
  (I keep copies in Google Photos, on Google Drive, on iCloud and locally).</li>
<li>As much as possible I'd automate the process of doing some, if not all of
  this.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, while it was kind of old as an idea, this felt very much like
one of those things that was perfect to do in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web
2.0</a> way; the good old reliable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">mashable
web</a>!</p>
<p>So the plan became this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every post would be a tweet, posted to Twitter with a <code>#photoblog</code> tag.</li>
<li>I'd use <a href="https://ifttt.com/">ifttt</a> to keep an eye on my tweets and when
  it saw one with that tag it would extract the image, make a post to
  Blogger, drop a copy into Google Drive, and do a couple of other things
  too.</li>
<li>Every week or so I'd do some manual checks to make sure everything is
  looking okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>This worked. Mostly. It ran fine for a few years, with very few problems.
I'd take a photo, manipulate the heck out of it for the emotional effect I
was going for (that was the point of the blog; it was all about the messing
with the image), tweet it, and Web 2.0 magic would happen.</p>
<p>Then the odd issue started to crop up. At one point Twitter made changes to
how images were stored, or something, and the ifttt recipe broke for a wee
while; then they changed the way that public posts could be seen (long
before the Musk-era bullshit) and that broke things again, and so on. I
forget the details but at every point I was able to nurse it back to life
and things carried on.</p>
<p>Recently, of course, it all fell apart when Musk took over Twitter and
massively ruined it, turning it into the steaming pile it is now<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I've
honestly lost track of which change broke what, and of course I also gave up
even trying to use Twitter (the drip, drip, drip of right-wing hate politics
got to a point where I could not find a way to make it work any more). So
that's when I decided to cut Twitter out altogether.</p>
<p>This had actually started a little earlier than that, when the whole API
fiasco kicked off. When that came in ifttt had to remove Twitter things from
its free tier; I was on the free tier. I was on the free tier only because I
didn't need anything the paid service offered. If Twitter had been "normal"
and this change had been made I'd have happily paid -- I don't mind paying
for things I find useful.</p>
<p>But, nope, given all the context, I bailed.</p>
<p>So by that point I decided the easiest thing to do was to simply hand-add
posts to Blogger, and also along the way post to <a href="https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/496199122963740964">a pixelfed account
instead</a>,
reposting those posts from <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep">my Fosstodon
account</a>. Not ideal, needing more manual
input, but also I was thinking that once I find a good flow I could probably
automate the whole thing again.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's the point I'd reached. Twitter was 100% out of the workflow,
there was a bit more manual intervention, but the <a href="https://seenbydavep.blogspot.com/">primary location for the
photos</a> was still getting updated.</p>
<p>Then yesterday I noticed this:</p>
<p><img alt="Broken images in my photoblog" src="/attachments/2023/08/20/borked-photos.png"></p>
<p>I don't actually quite know exactly what's going on here, and at this point
I really don't care. My working hypothesis is this: when ifttt added the
images to the Blogger posts, it was doing so in a way that it was using the
image hosted by Twitter. Because of this, either due to some change in the
Twitter API, or perhaps because I've locked down my Twitter account, the
images can't be served any more. That's my best guess anyway.</p>
<p>I don't really care to dig deeper than that.</p>
<p>But, yeah, this is another example of the long-growing rot of the dream of
Web 2.0. I'm not surprised; I'm not angry; I'm just disappointed.</p>
<p>Thankfully I have all the images saved (see backup options above), so I can
go back and edit the posts and drop fresh copies of the images into them.
There's 100s of posts affected so this is going to take quite a while; I
mean, sure, I could probably do it in a day if I sat and did nothing else,
but I have other things to do.</p>
<p>Another option would of course be to create a fresh blog using my own tools;
that would be simple enough. I have the images, they're all set with the
right date and time, recreating things would be fairly trivial (post titles
a slight problem but I could work around that); a tool like mkdocs or
Pelican plus some Python code to recreate the posts from the images would be
a fun couple of hours mucking about. But... I have a lot of posts on Blogger
and all the URLs are stable and still there many years later.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could automate the "fixing" of the broken posts? I wonder what the
Blogger API is like to work with?</p>
<p><em>PS: If you've read this and feel that what's </em>really<em> needed is a "helpful"
comment that self-hosting is the solution; please sit on that and read the
above again (and, you know, look over the rest of this blog and the entirety

  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html">just over a week
back</a>, last night I went to see a
Fringe show that was a production of <em>The Little Shop of Horrors</em>. Before
going I had no idea what to expect (in terms of how it would be done, not
what the content would be): I wasn't clear if it would be a really small
affair, or something on a bigger stage with reasonably high production
values (what can I say? It was LSoH, it was a Fringe show, it was booked
knowing nothing else).</p>
<p>When we got there and got into the venue it was... small, oh so very small!
No real set to speak of. The cast who were about to kick off the performance
didn't really seem to have much of a costume going on. So, without
judgement, I settled down to expect the next 90 minutes or so to be... a
Fringe experience.</p>
<p>First impressions were oh so wrong! While there was (for obvious reasons) a
lack of any real set, the effort that went into the performance really
worked and I absolutely enjoyed every single moment. Also, because it was a
production of the musical (which I haven't seen), rather than an adaption of
the movie (which I have), I got to experience a fresh ending (spoilers!).</p>
<p>The seats were uncomfortable. The room was down in the basement, with no
ventilation, and so was uncomfortably hot. Physically it wasn't a great
space to be. And yet I really wasn't wishing for it to be over. I think that
says a lot about the show itself.</p>
<p>I think special mention has to be given to the Audrey II models, of which
there were three different sizes. Someone put some real effort into them.</p>
<p>So, yeah, a fun night, topped and tailed with pre-show dinner and post-show
drinks with friends. I couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>Unless I last-moment book anything else over the next week, <a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html">there's one
more show to go</a> in my <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">push to go
and see at least one show per week of the
Fringe</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Sadly no photos. I wasn't sat in a great spot to take photos.</p></div>

      <div><p>That's a third show booked! This means that, <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html#off-to-see-nick-harper">as I
hoped</a>, I'm
going to manage at least one show a week for the Fringe!</p>
<p>Now, this one could be seen as a cheat, sorta, kinda. I've seen this show
before. But I liked it so much last year I <em>have</em> to see it again! The odd
thing about it was it's not something I would have gone for on my own, it's
technically not really my thing, but I got talked into it and I'm so glad I
was!</p>
<p>So a year back <a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle">Mariëlle</a> told me about
this wrestling show at the Fringe and how she wanted to go but nobody else
was interested and I was all <em>"yebbut wrestling though?"</em> and didn't think
much more about it. Eventually though, after some persuasion (I mean, an
hour or so at a show and some beers afterwards, how bad could it be
really?), I agreed to go. I expected to find it meh.</p>
<p><img alt="Cast of Mythos: Ragnarok 2022" src="/attachments/2023/08/15/IMG_7612.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Holy shit was it so much fun! Like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37r1CqMKLzM">seriously so much
fun</a>. I'd never realised that
wrestling was the best way to tell the tales from Norse mythology; turns out
that wrestling is absolutely the best way to tell the tales from Norse
mythology.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mythos-ragnarok">we're off back again this
year</a>. All booked,
not this weekend, the weekend after.</p>
<p>There might even be a beer afterwards. Perhaps not <em>quite</em> so many as last
year though.</p></div>

      <div><p>This evening I've spent more time working on <a href="/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html">the planned complete remake of
my personal website</a>, in this case
"porting" over many of the files that made up the old "miscellaneous stuff"
section of the site. If I'm honest, most if not all of the things in there
are no longer relevant (like: who really needs a shell script to make
<code>gnuplot</code> plots from files pulled off a 1990s-era Garmin handheld GPS
unit?), but I thought I'd keep them kicking around "just in case".</p>
<p>One wee section I wasn't going to get rid of though was my scans of three
pages from a UK magazine called <em>Personal Computer News</em>. These contain
<a href="https://www.davep.org/misc/grid-bike/">Grid Bike</a>; a game I wrote for the
VIC-20, all in BASIC, and got published. For my efforts I got a <em>huge</em>
cheque for £40! If that doesn't seem like much to you, trust me, to 1983 me
this was <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>I bought a 16k RAM pack with the money.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, while trying to improve some of the links in the text, I
decided to see if there was now an archive online somewhere and, sure
enough, there is: <a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews001-18Mar1983/">in the obvious
place</a>.
This means that my web site isn't the only copy of my program on the net. If
you go to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews041-21Dec1983/page/n9/mode/2up">December 21st 1983
edition</a>
and turn to around page 84, there I am!</p>
<p><img alt="The cover of PCN" src="/attachments/2023/08/14/PCN-cover.png#centre"></p>
<p>At this point I'm almost tempted to try and get an emulator up and running
and get the code going again. How much fun would it be to add a video to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">my
YouTube channel</a>, of me playing one of
the very first games I wrote?</p></div>
