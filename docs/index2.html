  <div>
      <div><p>It's been a wee while since I wrote anything here (been about a month) so I
thought I'd make mention of what's going on.</p>
<p>The main news is that I'm employed again!</p>
<p>Once <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">the news about the Textual layoffs
hit</a> I, of course, started the job
hunting process. This lasted for a wee while (and I have a couple of stories
about that -- perhaps I'll write them up one day). I officially became
"unemployed" on April the 1st (yeah, I know), and by the 23rd I had an offer
for a new position, which I accepted.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing I've been in that position for a touch over 3
weeks and it's going really well. Right at this moment I'm doing zero Python
work (that will change, I strongly suspect) and, actually, for the first
time ever, I'm writing some TypeScript (it's tempting me to dive into that
some more).</p>
<p>The team I'm working in are great and I'm also really impressed so far by
the practices they have in place relating to getting stuff done. It's
actually a refreshing change to work in a bigger organisation and actually
find it not massively frustrating!</p>
<p>I'm also back to working from home full time. This isn't that big a deal for
me as I spent around 22 years doing so <a href="2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">up until
2018</a>, and of course it isn't that big
of a deal to many folk these days anyway thanks to the 2020- period. This
prompted me to finally clear out the spare room (I've only been in here a
touch under 5 years so of course there were a lot of "I'll sort those soon"
boxes and stuff in there), buy a second desk, and make a work-coding area
that is away from totally separate from my for-fun-coding area.</p>
<p>This has turned out to be a <em>really</em> good decision. I love my main hacking
space in the living room, and have done a lot of work there, but that was
always on the odd days here and there when I'd work at home. Now that
working at home is a full-time role it felt important to make the
distinction.</p>
<p>Weirdly though, all of this means that I'm spending less time working on
personal stuff. When I was working at Textualize, most days, I'd be spending
the best part of 3 hours in the day getting to and from the office. I
thought that perhaps getting that time back would translate into having more
time to tinker with my own stuff. Actually what I'm finding I'm doing is I'm
spending the time on more general self-care and domestic things. This is a
good thing.</p>
<p>Doubtless once things really settle down and I form my new routine I'll dive
back into FOSS coding more again, and perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davep-codes">get back to streaming while I
code</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile though you <em>can</em> find me steaming many late evenings, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson/streams">mucking
about on my PS5</a>. Right at
this moment I'm finally playing all the way through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORBz0_ubHoJKT9xe3pvCTbRh">Just Cause
4</a>
(a game I bought back in 2019 and never finished). In fact last night I
finished the main story.</p>
<p>Expect a lot more PS5-based streaming nonsense over the next few months.</p>
<p>One other change I have made is to my VR video publishing schedule. For the
longest time I had the time and was playing so much that I published a video
every day. This wasn't a schedule I set myself, this was more a case of I
was playing so much that to publish less frequently would mean there would
be a huge backlog. These days I'm back to working 5 days a week (previously
I was working 4 days) so I have to cram a little more into my weekends, and
also I want to try and do other things during weekends too. So recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHko0fDZm7I">I
changed to an every-other-day
schedule</a>.</p>
<p>And, really, that's about it. For now expect to see a bit less Python-based
content on here, and also quite a bit less Textual-based stuff too.
Currently my focus is elsewhere and it also seems that Textual is a bit of a
moving target recently, throwing in some fun new bugs and breaking changes
which are tricky to keep on top of. That said, you <em>will</em> still find me in
the repo, lending a hand when I can, and of course in the Textual Discord
too; just don't expect to see me quite so omnipresent there, especially
during the work day.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a> v0.14.0.
This release adds a <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/issues/49">feature that a user
requested</a>, where you can set
the default values for the privacy and read-later status of a new bookmark:</p>
<p><img alt="The application settings dialog" src="/attachments/2024/05/15/app-settings.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, any time you create a new bookmark, the edit dialog will use those
values by default. It's a feature that makes perfect sense but I didn't
think to add it early on because... well, I set the defaults to my
preference.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">Tinboard</a> has turned into a tool I use
pretty much every day; it's probably my most-used Textual/Python-developed
application at this point. This is causing me to think more and more about
how I can add things to it that are related to the core purpose, but are
also outside of the main "interface with Pinboard" thing.</p>
<p>A thing with keeping bookmarks for a long time is that some of them go
stale, go away. Some will just plain 404, others the whole site will
disappear. If I find myself going back to a bookmark and seeing this is the
case, I'll hit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and see if
there's an archive there.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking: what if I add the ability to perform this check into
Tinboard itself? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDgiM6pUP2Y">So I did just that</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in the application, if you press <kbd>w</kbd> with a bookmark
highlighted, it will check with the Wayback Machine to see if the bookmark
is in the archive. If it isn't you see this:</p>
<p><img alt="No archive result" src="/attachments/2024/04/18/no-archive.png#centre"></p>
<p>On the other hand, if it <em>is</em> in the archive, you'll see something like
this:</p>
<p><img alt="Is in the archive result" src="/attachments/2024/04/18/has-archive.png#centre"></p>
<p>I sense this is going to be the first step in a couple of features related
to this. I'm thinking that I may go on to add a <em>"swap the URL for this
bookmark with the Wayback Machine archive URL"</em> feature, which will be handy
for those bookmarks that have one away, and it would also be useful to look
at the options for a <em>"please archive a copy of this bookmark"</em> feature.</p>
<p>But, for now, v0.12.0 is available and has this handy (for me anyway) first
step.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>

      <div><p>Back in the very early days of the <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">Textual
adventure</a>,
within the first month or so of working on the framework, we <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">had a period
of
dogfooding</a>.
One of the projects I wrote during that time was a little tool <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/12/08/be-the-keymaster/#pispy">I called
PISpy</a>.</p>
<p>The initial version was pretty much a quick hack; during that dogfooding
period I did my best to try and develop a new project every couple of days.
Since then I've let PISpy descend into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">bit
rot</a>.</p>
<p>In the last week or so I've turned my attention back to it and made an
effort to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CepsN8TDq1E">tidy up the code</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EUXA8RkN0">tidy it some more</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u5CfrgZWcc">and some
more</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDCvWCZx1AM">even some
more</a>.</p>
<p>This morning I put the finishing touches to these changes and released
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pispy/releases/tag/v0.6.0">v0.6.0</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/67xtMdstbx4"><img alt="PISpy in action" src="/attachments/2024/04/17/pispy-in-action.gif#centre"></a></p>
<p>PISpy can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideallty) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">from
PyPI</a>. It can also be installed with
Homebrew by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>pispy</code>:</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>When <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108996">desktop widgets</a> first turned
up in macOS I was pretty quick to embrace them. On my personal Mac Mini I
use a pair of screens, the right one mostly given over to Emacs, and there
was generally room to space there. These days that screen generally looks
something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The usual layout of my right screen" src="/attachments/2024/04/17/right-screen.png#centre"></p>
<p>Recently I've got into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davep-codes/streams">streaming while I do some
coding</a> and it's the
right-hand screen that I work on and capture using OBS. When I was setting
this up I realised that the widgets being there could be a problem; not
because they could distract or anything, more that they could, at times,
contain sensitive information (there's my reminder list and my calendar
there after all).</p>
<p>What I needed was a quick method of hiding all the widgets, and showing them
again later, without it being a lot of faff.</p>
<p>With a little bit of digging around on the net I finally came up with a pair
of <code>fish</code> abbreviations that do just the job!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr -g widoff &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StandardHideWidgets -int 1&quot;
abbr -g widon &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StandardHideWidgets -int 0&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, when I'm going to stream, part of my "getting stuff ready to go live"
checklist is to run <code>widoff</code> in the terminal; once I'm finished I can then
just run <code>widon</code> again to have them come back.</p>
<p>Fast, clean, handy.</p>
<p>I've also got a pair for when I'm using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl534ba392/mac">Stage
Manager</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr -g smwidoff &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StageManagerHideWidgets -int 1&quot;
abbr -g smwidon &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StageManagerHideWidgets -int 0&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Although, really, I can't remember the last time I used Stage Manager. I
dabbled with it for a wee while, found it vaguely handy in a couple of
situations, but it doesn't seem to have stuck as part of my workflow or work
environment.</p></div>

      <div><p>While <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">my time working on Textual might have come to an
end</a>, my time working <em>with</em> Textual
hasn't. Three days back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U66oHFLWmG4">I experimented with Textual's newly-added "inline
mode"</a>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U66oHFLWmG4?si=kCQba6vMoxpKMtBG"
        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>In doing so I extended the application so that it's possible to run
<code>tinboard add</code> and quickly enter a new bookmark and then carry on in the
terminal, without needing to "go fullscreen". I'll admit it's of limited
use, but it seemed like a good shakedown of the feature and in working on it
I was able to discover a couple of bugs
(<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4385">#4385</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4403">#4403</a>).</p>
<p>The effect of this is this:</p>
<p><img alt="Tinboard inline addition in action" src="/attachments/2024/04/09/tinboard-inline-add.gif#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>tinboard</code>:</p>

      <div><p>While I have been <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">on the receiving end of redundancy once
before</a>, that was after 21 years of
service at a company that, while it was in part about software development,
I would never have called it a "tech" company.</p>
<p>So, as of today, I can finally say that the "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/tech-layoffs-2023-list/">tech
layoffs</a>" came
for me and I'm one of 67% of employees being let go from a tech startup.</p>
<p>Achievement unlocked, I guess?</p>
<p><img alt="!Achievement unlocked" src="/attachments/2024/03/28/achievement-unlocked.png#centre"></p>
<p>To be clear: I'm not annoyed about this, I'm not even shocked about this; I
planned for this from the off and realised and recognised the gamble I was
taking <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1574118265063972864">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1574118265063972864"><img alt="Announcing being hired" src="/attachments/2024/03/28/textual-startup-tweet.png#centre"></a></p>
<p>I am disappointed about this. Not in a "I'm disappointed in you" kind of
way, but disappointed for all involved and what it says about how FOSS
projects are funded and maintained.</p>
<p>It's been an interesting journey, and it's been a privilege to do something
I've been wanting to do since the 1990s, when I first read the GNU Manifesto
and subsequently watched the free software and open source movements develop
and grow: work on FOSS for a living. In doing this I've developed my
thoughts about the feasibility of such an endeavour, I've refined how I feel
about working in very small teams, I've learnt a lot of useful lessons I'm
going to draw on in the future (keeping a journal of my experience has been
a great move; I have a lot of notes and thoughts written down that I'll be
reviewing and distilling for myself over the coming weeks).</p>
<p>Most of all: it's been an absolute blast working on something that people
are actually using to build <a href="https://github.com/davep/transcendent-textual">cool
things</a>, and to <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/help/">provide help
and guidance to those people when they've needed
it</a>.</p>
<p>So... what happens now? Well, of course, right now, I'm looking for a new
position. If you're reading this and you are looking for someone who's kinda
handy with Python <a href="https://github.com/davep">and a bunch of other languages</a>
and who loves learning new stuff, or if you know someone who is looking for
such a person, <a href="mailto:davep@davep.co.uk">do drop me a line</a>!</p>
<p>As for what happens with Textual, and my involvement with it...</p>
<p>Well, what happens <em>with</em> Textual is
<a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan">Will</a>'s call, of course. As for my
involvement with it: I care about FOSS and I care about Textual; I also care
about the folk who have been kind enough to use their time to explore it,
test it, build with it, commit to it and make neat stuff with it. My
intention, as long as free time allows, is to carry on being involved, both
on GitHub and in <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">the Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>It's my sincere hope that, as a community of FOSS-friendly developers, we
see Textual over the 1.0 line and beyond.</p>
<p>But all that starts next week. It's a bank holiday weekend and I think I
might have deserved a run, a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">mucking about in
VR</a>, a beer, and just a wee bit of
down time.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the past year and a half I've written a <em>lot</em> of Python code, and a lot
of that Python code has been Textual applications; most of those Textual
applications have been very quick demonstration or test applications built
to help support someone asking for help; some of them have been less-trivial
applications written in my own time and for my own use and amusement. Of
them I'd say there are two near-daily-drivers, and a couple that I either
have more plans for, or like to maintain just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Those latter applications are all ones that <a href="https://pypi.org/user/davepearson/">I've deployed to
PyPI</a>, and because of that are all ones
that I've recommenced be installed using
<a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/"><code>pipx</code></a>. During that time though I've had
half an inclination to make them <a href="https://brew.sh/">installable via
Homebrew</a>. While probably not installable from the core
Homebrew repository<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, at least installable from a "tap"<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> that's under
my own GitHub account or something.</p>
<p>To this end I've had <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew">a blog post about packaging Python apps for
Homebrew</a>
saved in Pinboard for a while now, and every time I look at it I think
<em>"this is a lot of faff, maybe later"</em>. Today was that "later".</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was <em>way</em> easier than I first realised. The evolution
of today pretty much went like this:</p>
<h2>Deciding to use a single repository as the "tap"</h2>
<p>The blog post above seemed to suggest that for every application repository
you want a tap for, you probably want a parallel <code>homebrew-</code>-prefixed
repository. This in turn would suggest that every time someone wants to
install one of your tools, they'd need to add a new tap<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. As I looked at
it this seemed like way too much faff, so in the end I decided <a href="https://github.com/davep/homebrew-homebrew">to create a
single repository that I'd keep all my formula files
in</a>. The naming of
<code>homebrew-homebrew</code> meant that the tap name would simply be
<code>davep/homebrew</code>.</p>
<p>Simple and clean, I think: things for homebrew, things that can be installed
via homebrew, that come from davep. To add the tap it's simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Ensuring that all my applications and libraries publish source</h2>
<p>Although it seems that it might be (possibly, maybe, perhaps, who can tell?)
deprecated, it looked like
<a href="https://github.com/tdsmith/homebrew-pypi-poet"><code>homebrew-pypi-poet</code></a> was a
tool I'd need to do all the heavy work on making the formula file. A quick
test threw up a problem where it was complaining that my test package (one
of my own applications) didn't have an <code>sdist</code>. Sure enough, through nothing
more than never having bothered to make it happen, the source of my
libraries and applications wasn't been uploaded to PyPI when I published.</p>
<p>So I went through some of my repositories and fixed that, making patch
releases as I went.</p>
<h2>Making a <code>Makefile</code> to let me be lazy</h2>
<p>The next thing to do was to figure out the most lazy way of building the
formula files. From what I could see the main steps to making all of this
work were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a venv and activate it</li>
<li>Install <code>homebrew-pypi-poet</code></li>
<li>Install the package you want to package for Homebrew</li>
<li>Run <code>poet</code> to make the formula</li>
</ul>
<p>Seemed simple enough. For all sorts of lazy reasons I still tend to use
<code>pipenv</code> to get things done quickly, and that seemed to work fine here too.
I'm also a fan of <code>PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=true</code> which makes things clean and
tidy, so I figured a rule in a <code>Makefile</code> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">clean</span><span class="o">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-rf<span class="w"> </span>.venv
<span class="w">        </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>Pipfile<span class="w"> </span>Pipfile.lock
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.12
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--dev<span class="w"> </span>homebrew-pypi-poet
</code></pre></div>

<p>would be fine to make a clean venv ready to build the formula, and then I'd
have a rule for the package itself that depended on the above, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">oshit</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">clean</span>
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oshit
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>poet<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>oshit<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>Formula/oshit.rb
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Fixing the package description</h2>
<p>The above was great, and worked really well. But there was one issue that I
could see: the resulting formula file always had this <code>desc</code> inside it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">desc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Shiny new formula&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>From what I could see there was no way to tell <code>poet</code> what I wanted the
description to be, and neither did I want to have to remember to edit that
line each time I regenerated the formula file. So <code>sed</code> to the rescue then I
guess, with this sort of thing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sed<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;s/Shiny new formula/The actual text I want/&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span>Formula/coolapp.rb
</code></pre></div>

<h2>The result</h2>
<p>The result of all of this is that I now have <a href="https://github.com/davep/homebrew-homebrew">a repository that I or anyone
else can use as a tap</a> to be
able to install my stuff using the <code>brew</code> command. So now if you want a
little Hacker News reader for the terminal but you don't want to be messing
with installing <code>pipx</code> and the like, but you do use <code>brew</code> on your machine,
it's just this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oshit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Fingers crossed it all "just works" when I next upgrade one of those
packages. I will, of course, have to remember to go into
<code>davep/homebrew-homebrew</code> and <code>make the-app</code> for the relevant application,
and then commit and push the changes, but that's really not too difficult to
remember and do.</p>
<p>Hopefully it'll then all just work.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>I just realised that it's been a while since I <a href="/2023/12/25/tinboard-0-4-0.html">last posted an
update</a> about <code>tinboard</code>. This is probably
my most-used Textual-based application, and one I'm constantly tinkering
with, and just this morning I published v0.10.0.</p>
<p>Often the changes are small tweaks or fixes to how it works, sometimes
they're simply updates to the version of Textual used, making use of some
new feature or other; I've yet to add another "major" feature so far. They
will come, but so far the ideas I have for the application haven't actually
felt that necessary. Although I say so myself it does what I need it to do
and it does it really well.</p>
<p>So, as a quick catch-up of what's changed since v0.4.0 (which was the last
version I posted about):</p>
<ul>
<li>v0.5.0 was released 2024-01-04; this included all the tags of a bookmark
when doing full-text searching.</li>
<li>v0.6.0 was released 2024-01-10; it fixed a small bug where the tag
suggestion facility got confused by trailing spaces in the input field.</li>
<li>v0.7.0 was released 2024-02-02; this updated the minimum Textual version to
v0.48.2 and removed all the custom changes to the Textual <code>TextArea</code> widget,
making use of the updates to <code>TextArea</code> that version of Textual made
available.</li>
<li>v0.8.0 was released 2024-02-18; this fixed a crash on startup caused by a
newer release of Textual (the fault was in <code>tinboard</code>; the update to Textual
helped reveal the problem).</li>
<li>v0.9.0 was released 2024-02-29; it simply added support for using
<kbd>Esc</kbd> at the top level of the application to quit (I like to camp
on <kbd>Esc</kbd> to GTFO).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just now, I released v0.10.0. This release makes full use of <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/4154">some
work I recently did to enhance Textual's <code>CommandPalette</code>
widget</a>, which added a
"discover" system. The change in <code>tinboard</code> is that all of the <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/tree/main/tinboard/commands">command
palette
providers</a>
now have <code>discover</code> methods too. The result of this change is that when you
open the command palette in <code>tinboard</code> (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) you
can see <em>every</em> possible command right away.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in discovery mode" src="/attachments/2024/03/07/command-palette.png#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from

      <div><p><img alt="Death Stranding" src="/attachments/2024/02/05/IMG_4223.JPG#centre"></p>
<p>Death Stranding is easily one of my top 5 games ever. I bought the PS4
version, on a whim, back in early 2020, to see what all the fuss was about.
I didn't know much about it other than the love/hate it seemed to be
getting. I can still remember the first session, being a bit confused about
what was going on, and then suddenly hitting a perfect moment in the game
where I knew it was for me, and that I was going to love it.</p>
<p>That moment? It's when you're setting out for the incinerator, the camera
pulls back, the landscape opens up before you, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwoMJNxiFo"><em>Bones</em> by Low Roar
kicks in</a>. Perfection!</p>
<p>I went on to finish the story in around 45 to 50 hours (much of that
overlapping with the first week or so of lockdown during the pandemic); and
then played at least as much again just exploring, building zip lines,
roads, etc.</p>
<p>I even <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/">kept a photoblog of my time in the
game</a>.</p>
<p>About a year back I bought the Director's Cut of the game, this time for PC.
I'd decided that I had to play it through again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb7390_rldQ&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORDJd_VYhF74e6Mapf8oHp8i">and did start streaming
it</a>.
Annoyingly though the PC setup wasn't great. The game itself ran just fine
on my PC, but the controller setup meant that, as I sat on the sofa, it
would drop connection from time to time. The only workaround for this was to
sit on my office chair closer to the TV and, really, this wasn't
comfortable.</p>
<p>Eventually that play-through fell away.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLstJHlC4U">and the release of the 10 minute Death Stranding
2 trailer</a> and I was hooked all
over again! While it never totally went away, my obsession with this game
was back full force.</p>
<p>I had to play again!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, between the attempt to play through on the PC and now, I'd
acquired a PS5 <em>and</em> at some point I'd upgraded my PS4 version of Death
Stranding to the PS5 Director's Cut.</p>
<p>So I had to. I just had to. I'd had a great time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU">streaming my play through
the story of Cyberpunk
2077</a>
so it made sense to do the same with Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Last night I hit <em>New game</em> on my PS5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-irn7AcJ7g">and played for just over 2
hours</a>. This play through is
likely going to take a long time -- my work situation means I have a longer
and more tiring commute -- but I'm determined to do it. I want to experience
all of the extra things in the Director's Cut, including the extra story
(which I've read there is, but haven't seen or read about).</p>
<p>I hope, eventually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-irn7AcJ7g&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORCBUB0_pmQ5hKu1WTJnAVGI">the playlist I
started</a>
will have the full story plus lots more fun and building and exploring in
it. Hopefully I'll be done just in time for the release of DS2! (and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">GTA6</a>, it's going to be a busy
year for gaming next year!)</p></div>
