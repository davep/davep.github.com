      <div><p>This seems to have started with iOS 17, and I can't narrow down the how and
the when of it happening, but over the last week or so I've found that every
couple of days Siri seems to lose their voice. By this I mean the high
quality voice that's used when they speak seems to disappear. I notice this
when I ask my phone or headphones a question or to do something, and I get a
really low-quality voice that speaks back to me.</p>
<p>The voice itself seems to be a version of the voice I normally use, but like
it's using an on-device much-cut-down version. If I go into the settings to
check what voice is selected, it's the one I normally use, but it wants to
download it again.</p>
<p><img alt="Downloading the voice all over again" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/siri-voice-loss.png"></p>
<p>Sure enough, once the download is complete all is good again. I've not kept
track of when it happens -- and I think I should from now on -- but it feels
like it happens every couple of days; I almost always notice it first thing
in the morning, the first time I ask the phone or the headphones something.</p>
<p>I hope it is some sort of iOS 17 weirdness and is gone when 17.1 turns up.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This one has been brewing for a year, more or less. Now that I commute into
and back from Edinburgh most days of the working week, I find myself walking
past a couple of music shops. Seeing these reminds me of the days, back in
my 20s, when I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davepearson/albums/72157600225099352">mucked around in a couple of
bands</a>
and had fun making noises on a bass guitar. Since that time I've also owned
a cheap six string electric, which is currently in storage (and has been
since 2016) and an acoustic, which I have with me but I live in an apartment
building and I'm not an arsehole so I never play it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, walking past those shops has made me want to muck about on a
guitar again. I've never properly learnt the guitar, I've just managed to
learn enough chords to make some noises I like for my own amusement, but
even then I've not picked one up since around 2016 and what little I do know
is very rusty.</p>
<p>Add to the above: earlier this year I was at a friend's and admiring her
collection of bass and six string guitars and picked a couple up and
realised I could not play anything. It had been too long, I'd lost most
muscle memory and coordination, and what little knowledge I had.</p>
<p>So this made me want to fix this even more.</p>
<p>Given the apartment thing I decided on a plan: how about I get an eclectic,
and then some sort of amplification that would always rely on headphones?
Given such a setup I could knuckle down and try and learn properly.</p>
<p>So, this week, being on holiday, I told myself I'd pop into Edinburgh one
day and have a look at my options; perhaps even come home with something.
Yesterday was that day.</p>
<p>It didn't quite go to plan, but the outcome was that I ended up with
something to play.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Höfner" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3329.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>So, on getting into the shop, and explaining what I was after and why to the
chap in there, I tried the usual Stratocaster and Telecaster thing. Both
were fine (I think I liked the feel of the Telecaster more in my hand). I
had one eye on a Les Paul too, but never tried that. What I did see though
was this rather lovely black Höfner.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it's hollow body, so sort of has that acoustic thing going
on. This isn't what I wanted for playing in an apartment. But I had to try
it anyway. As soon as I started dabbling I was sold. The sound was enough
that it would be easy to pick up and play without having to faff with
amplification of any sort, on the other hand it was nowhere near as loud as
my acoustic. I felt like it bridged the gap between easy to pick up, and
versatile enough should I ever want to plug it into something.</p>
<p>And... let's be honest: it was black. Sooooo black. I like black.</p>
<p>Long story short... it had to come home with me!</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: most of my guitar stuff is still in storage, from when
I moved to Scotland, but I <em>did</em> find my old tin of plectrums and the tuner.</p>
<p><img alt="Standard guitar kit" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3330.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p><center>
    <em>(Yes, the tin was once mine and was once full; the early 90s were a
    different time)</em>
</center></p>
<p>I even found one of my old stands, that I've had since around 1991! So now
it's set up in my living room, next to the PCVR rig, ready to go at a
moment's notice.</p>
<p><img alt="On its stand, ready to go" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3331.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>This is my plan now: each weekend I aim to put in at least an hour a day of
practice, to try and get my fingers up to strength again, and to build up
the muscle memory of where the strings are, to get the coordination between
both hands, etc. I'm also going to be working through beginner's lessons
from a tutor application. I'm going to treat this like I'm the complete
novice I am and slowly work on improving.</p>
<p>There's no end goal; other than just get proficient enough that I can muck
about on my own and be happy that I can play the sorts of things I want to
be able to play.</p>
<p>Also, it's good to learn new stuff, <em>especially</em> new stuff that isn't just
more coding.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>According to YouTube I joined up on 2006-09-04. I don't think that's quite
correct. I <em>did</em> have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Video">Google
Video</a> account from very early
on, and uploaded a couple of things, and it got ported to a YouTube account
when Google <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">discontinued</a> the original video
service and settled on YouTube post-purchase. So I guess, in some respects,
it's kind of correct.</p>
<p>For most of that time I had hardly anything on there. Couple of videos to do
with the weather station I ran for a few years, some things related to my
photography, couple of things related to hacking with code; that's about it.</p>
<p>Then, a couple or so years back, when I got heavily into PCVR gaming, I
started to record my gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORCk74IQ3sfWsxg242qLwQ8g">upload
them</a>.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing there are 1,109 videos in the PCVR playlist, and
around 1,300 videos on my channel in total.</p>
<p>As for subscribers... eh, come on, few people are really interested in
watching some old bloke stumble around in VR, and I was <em>very</em> late to the
game anyway. But, apparently, around 350 lovely folk care enough about my
nonsense to subscribe.</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough for a YouTube play button, that's for sure. Only... I
now have a play button!</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3304.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I mean, sure, I have to build it myself...</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3305.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>...but it's something to show for all my efforts, I guess. ;-)</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3306.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>As for how I got it: presumably anyone/everyone with a YouTube account with
some content got the offer of goodies (I also got offered free coffee,
sausage rolls, socks, and a bunch of other stuff I've forgotten), and I was
lucky to claim one of these almost the instant the email turned up.</p>
<p>It's very likely the only YouTube play button I'll ever receive. I think it
will take pride of place on my desk.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I have a LinkedIn profile more by accident than on purpose. For most of that
site's early days I just ignored it, even needing to go to the trouble of
aggressively marking emails from it as spam as it seemed to want to turn
itself into some sort of online networking cult, encouraging folk to send
invites to their contacts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn#Use_of_e-mail_accounts_of_members_for_spam_sending">or
worse</a>.
But after job-seeking in late 2017 the recruiter who found me the position I
took up asked if I might join up and endorse him or some such nonsense and,
at the time, I thought what the hell.</p>
<p>Since then though I've mostly found it useless, and at times straight up
horrific. Don't even get me started on how a previous employer's push to
make everyone use their profiles as more company branding created a perfect
pool for people to go phishing in, while at the same time IT were on a
phishing-awareness push; a perfect illustration of how some people lose
their minds when it comes to that site.</p>
<p>The last year though, while working in a more FOSSy world, I've started to
dip my toe back in when it comes to linking to what we're building with
Textual. As such, I drop into the app once or twice a week and look to see
what other folk might be talking about too.</p>
<p>During a recent dip in I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="A suggestion from LinkedIn" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-suggestion.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Huh! Okay! That... that's actually kind of sensible! While I'm nowhere near
looking for anything else to do, showing off the public projects you care
about seems like a good idea. GitHub repos can be a good CV, I believe.</p>
<p>So I click through...</p>
<p><img alt="The project add form" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-add.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>And that's where it all falls apart. Pretty typical for LinkedIn I'd say.
Name, description, obsession with skills, obsession with building up a
social graph. But...</p>
<p>No link to the repo.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Link.</p>
<p>To.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Repo. O_o</p>
<p>o_O</p>
<p>I can't even.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>For as long as I've had a smartphone -- so ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> was released -- I've used
whatever search tool Google have had available as my way of searching for
stuff from my phone. Even when I made the switch to the iPhone, back when
the iPhone 11 was around, I still installed and used the Google Search app.</p>
<p>Since jumping ship from Android to iPhone, I've followed the usual track
that some do of "embracing the ecosystem", and it generally has paid off.
The more I lean into "the Apple way", the more stuff actually does work
together and work together well (I won't say "it just works", because that
can sometimes so <em>very</em> not be true, but really I do find that Apple's
ecosystem is more coherent and more stable than the one Google provided).
But searching for stuff... that stuck with the Google search app.</p>
<p>So, more as an experiment than anything else, starting this morning I've
removed the Google search app from the home screens of my iPhone and my iPad
and I'm going to force myself to use Spotlight to do all my searching, and
see how I get on with it.</p>
<p><img alt="Searching with Apple" src="/attachments/2023/10/14/apple-search.png#centre"></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to searching for stuff on the web, it's not going
to make a whole heap of difference; it's sill going to end up searching with
Google, but I do like the idea of search leaning into what Spotlight knows
about my stuff too.</p>
<p>Also, on my phone at least, it has the added benefit of freeing up a slot in
the dock at the bottom of the home screen.</p></div>

      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview"><code>textual-astare</code></a> is another
Textual-based Python project that I've developed in the last year and I
don't believe I've mentioned on this blog. Simply put, it's a took for
viewing the abstract syntax tree of Python code, in the terminal.</p>
<p><img alt="astare in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/10/astare.png#centre"></p>
<p>I've just made a small update to it this evening after someone asked <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions/12">for a
sensible change I've been meaning to do for a
while</a>. When I
first read the request I <em>was</em> going to look at it next week, when I have
some time off work, but you know how it is when you sit at your desk and
have a "quick look".</p>
<p>So anyway, yeah, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-astview/">v0.8.0</a> is out
there and can be installed, with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a></li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.39.0"><code>textual</code></a></li>
<li>Made it so you can open a directory to browser from the command line.</li>
<li>Made opening the current working directory the default.</li>
<li>Tweaked the way dark/light mode get toggled so that it's now
  command-palette-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the code does need a wee bit of tidying -- this was one of my
earliest apps built with Textual and my approach to writing Textual apps has
changed a fair bit this year, and Textual itself has grown and improved in
that time -- but it's still working well for now.</p></div>

      <div><p>In about a week's time I'll have had a GitHub account for 15 years! I can't
even remember what motivated me to create one now, but back in October 2008
I grabbed the <code>davep</code> account...</p>
<p><img alt="Making my account" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/account-made.png#centre"></p>
<p>...and then made my <a href="https://github.com/davep/dict.rb">first repo</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="First repo made" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/first-repo.png#centre"></p>
<p>My use of the site after that was <em>very</em> sporadic. It looks like I'd add or
update something once or twice a year, but I wasn't a heavy user.</p>
<p><img alt="First few years" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/first-few-years.png#centre"></p>
<p>Then around the middle of 2015 I seem to have started using it a lot more.</p>
<p><img alt="The next few years" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/next-few-years.png#centre"></p>
<p>This very much shows that during those years I was working on personal stuff
that I was making available in case anyone found it useful, but also leaning
heavily on GitHub as a (<em>a</em>, not <em>the</em>) place to keep backups of code I
cared about (or even no longer cared about). Quite a lot of that green will
likely be me having a few periods of <a href="/category/emacs.html">revamping my Emacs
configuration</a>.</p>
<p>The really fun part though starts about a year ago:</p>
<p><img alt="Working on FOSS full time" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/full-time.png#centre"></p>
<p>It's pretty obvious when I started working at Textualize, and working on a
FOSS project full time. This is, without a doubt, the most green my
contribution graph has looked. It looks like there's a couple of days this
year where I haven't visited my desk at all, and I think this is a good
thing (I try really hard to have a life outside of coding when it comes to
weekends), but I'm also delighted to see just how busy this year looks.</p>
<p>I really hope this carries on for a while to come.</p>
<p>Apparently, as of the time of writing, I've made 12,588 contributions that
are on GitHub. What's <em>really</em> fun is the fact that my first contribution
pre-dates my GitHub account by 9 years!</p>
<p><img alt="My very first contribution" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/very-first-contrib.png#centre"></p>
<p>This one's pretty easy to explain: this is back from when I was involved
with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_(programming_language)">Harbour</a>.
Back then we were using SourceForge to manage the project (as was the
fashion at the time), and at some point in the past whoever is maintaining
the project has pulled the full history into GitHub.</p>
<p>My <a href="/attachments/2023/10/01/contributions.png">contribution history on
GitHub</a> is actually older than my
adult son. I suspect it's older than at least one person I work with. :-/ <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

  <div>
      <div><p>I don't think I've mentioned it before on this blog, but some time back I
decided it would be fun to use <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> to
write a Mandelbrot explorer (simple Mandelbrot explorers have been another
one of my favourite <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">known problem to try an unknown
thing</a> problems). Doing it in the
terminal seemed like a fun little hack. I started off with creating
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas"><code>textual-canvas</code></a> and then built
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot"><code>textual-mandelbrot</code></a> on top
of that.</p>
<p>Not too long back <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/15/textual-0370-adds-a-command-palette/">I added a "command palette" to
Textual</a>
(I'd prefer to call it a minibuffer, but I get that that's not fashionable
these days), but so far I've not used it in any of my own projects; earlier
today I thought it could be fun to add it to <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mandelbrot commands in action" src="/attachments/2023/09/29/mandelbrot-commands.png#centre"></p>
<p>Most of the commands I've added are trivial and really better covered by
(and are covered by) keystrokes, but it was a good test and a way to show
off how to create a command provider.</p>
<p>Having started this I can see some more useful things to add: for example it
might be interesting to add a facility where you can bookmark a specific
location, zoom level, iteration value, etc, and revisit later. The command
palette would feel like a great way to pull back those bookmarks.</p>
<p>What I really liked though was how <em>easy</em> this was to do. <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot/blob/main/textual_mandelbrot/commands.py">The code to make
the commands
available</a>
is pretty trivial and, I believe, easy to follow. Although I do say so
myself I think I managed to design a very accessible API for this.</p>
<p>There's more I'd like to add to that (the Textual command palette itself, I
mean), of course; this was just the start. Support for commands that accept
and prompt for arguments would be a neat and obvious enhancement (especially
if done in a way that's reminiscent of how commands could be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager">CLIM</a> -- I
remember <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-cldict/">really liking</a> how you
could create self-documenting and self-completing commands in that).</p>
<p>All in good time...</p></div>

      <div><p>As someone who started out in the Android ecosystem when it came to smart
phones -- starting out with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> and going through a few
different phones before settling on Pixels (until I finally jumped ship to
iOS in 2020) -- I have to admit that there's always been something nice
about the design of iPhones. iOS, less so... My first exposure to iOS was
<a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">back in 2015 when I got an iPod</a>,
and I wasn't terribly impressed. It looked okay, but it felt so far behind
Android in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>Much has changed and improved since then. These days, 3 years into being
totally consumed by the Apple ecosystem (one day I should write a post about
how comprehensively I've moved over), I'm won over and I like how iOS works
now.</p>
<p>Except this...</p>
<p><img alt="Bad design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-bad.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>That thing where, when you're in one app, it will show the most useless link
"back" to another app, and in doing so bump the time up and out of the way a
little. Like, seriously, compare it to when the app link thing isn't there:</p>
<p><img alt="Good design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-good.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Once you see it, you can't unsee it.</p>
<p><img alt="Toggle of the two images" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/bad-good-toggle.gif#centre"></p>
<p>After all this time you'd think they would have found a less janky way of
doing this; perhaps even simply removed it (I can't remember the last time I
needed or wanted the ability to go "back" an app like this, especially not
with the bottom-of-screen swipe gesture being a thing). If nothing else
you'd think that, by now, they'd have found a way of doing it that doesn't
look so terrible.</p>
<p>The <em>"eh, let's just shove it here"</em> approach that seems to be on display
here almost reminds me of <a href="/2015/10/07/imac-time-wiggle.html">the "time wiggle" that used to mildly annoy me
back on my iMac</a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Some time around late October or early November last year, around the time I
started working at <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>, I "discovered"
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. While I didn't need another note-taking
application (having gone through Evernote, trying to use
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a>, dabbling with a couple of other things and
finally settling mainly on Apple Notes), I was quite taken by its style and
ubiquity and the fact that it was, at heart, just a bunch of Markdown files.</p>
<p>So quite quickly I started using it; not to replace Apple Notes (which is
still my general note-taking tool of choice), but to keep work notes and a
daily coding journal, the latter coming in useful for the quick end-of-day
meetings we normally have.</p>
<p>One of the things I was quite taken by was the graph. It was interesting and
fun to see how each of my work days related to other work days, and what
subjects kept getting pulled in, etc.</p>
<p>So come the start of this year I had an idea: what would it be like to keep
a personal vault, but one where I track things I've done. Not a journal as
such (I do keep one of those too, have done for many years now, but that's
for other far more important reasons -- perhaps I'll write about that one
day too), just a daily record of stuff I've achieved, stuff I've actually
done, the routine things and the exceptional things?</p>
<p>What would that graph look like?</p>
<p>While it's not the end of this year yet, here's how that's shaping up:</p>
<p><img alt="The main graph" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/MainGraph.png#centre"></p>
<p>Each of the yellow circles is a day, each of the blue ones is a tag of some
sort. As you'd imagine, the size of the circles relates to how often that
item is tagged. So I can see what proportion of my days so far this year
have been tagged with being heavily involved with work:</p>
<p><img alt="Work" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Work.png#centre"></p>
<p>Likewise, if I want to see how many days this year have involved a
significant spot of gaming:</p>
<p><img alt="Gaming" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Gaming.png#centre"></p>
<p>Ditto for days where I've done some coding on pet projects, or even some
personal-time coding relating to work projects (it might be work, but it's
also Free Software and I do like to support FOSS!)</p>
<p><img alt="Coding" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Coding.png#centre"></p>
<p>I sort of have a curated set of tags I apply, but I've not made it a strict
set; if some new situation crops up that calls for a new tag I'll use it.
Mostly though I try and keep the tags pretty general so lots of days can
relate to the same general subject.</p>
<p>Another thing I've done is tag each and every day with the day of the week,
so while it's not really surprising to find that Sunday doesn't dominate
over other days, I can see which days are Sundays and perhaps wander along
the connections and see what I get up to:</p>
<p><img alt="Sunday" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Sunday.png#centre"></p>
<p>I don't quite know what I hope to get out of this, I don't really know if
there's anything useful to be had here at all, but it will be interesting to
look back over it at the end of the year. It also means that I'll have a
directory hierarchy full of Markdown files, all tagged and filled with
information, which I'll be able to <code>grep</code> and slice and dice and count and
perhaps pull into a database and cross-reference with stuff and things.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it's all just really me not having a good use for Obsidian but
inventing one anyway. ;-)</p></div>
