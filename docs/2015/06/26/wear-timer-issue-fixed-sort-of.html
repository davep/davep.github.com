<meta name="description" content="Following on from yesterday&#39;s problem with the Android Wear timer I think I now have a solution. It came up while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue. I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I&#39;ve seen a number of times before with Google stuff. One thing that&#39;s rather common (in many cases for very obvious reasons -- you can&#39;t cover the whole world in one go) with Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared to be unaffected by the issue (I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s on the latest version of Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out he was the same as me: British English. So much for that idea. But then he suggested switching to US English and back again. Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft &#34;turn it off and on again&#34; approach to a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and really do suffer the same issues) I switched to en-US on the phone and tried setting a timer in voice on the watch. It worked! So then I switched back to en-GB on the phone and... ...it still worked! I&#39;ve tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it&#39;s yet to fail. It would appear, as odd as it is, that this is the fix. Well, a fix." />

    <p>Following on from
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/06/25/did-google-just-break-wear-timers.html">yesterday's problem with the Android Wear timer</a>
I think I now have a solution. It came up
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/RZujypG7EyF">while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue</a>.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I've seen a number of
times before with Google stuff. One thing that's rather common (in many cases
for very obvious reasons -- you can't cover the whole world in one go) with
Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This
felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared

Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that
became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out
he was the same as me: British English.</p>
<p>So much for that idea.</p>
<p>But then he suggested switching to US English and back again.</p>
<p>Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft "turn it off and on again" approach to
a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and

<p>It worked!</p>

<p>...it still worked!</p>
<p>I've tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it's yet
to fail.</p>
