<meta name="description" content="I woke up this morning to find that one of my more recent favourite websites, Medium, had finally released an Android application. I&#39;m more of an avid reader than a writer on there (I&#39;ve only ever written 2 articles on there, and have toyed with the import facility too) so I imagine the app won&#39;t make too much of a difference to me, but it was nice to see that something that had been iOS-only was now on Android too. I installed it on my Nexus 7 and Nexus 6 and then, given that I have an iOS device now, I installed it on that too. In doing so I noticed a very curious difference: vs: Notice how Android has Google as an option whereas that&#39;s not an option on iOS? The curious thing is, when I installed it on my Android devices, I logged in with my Google account and it all just worked. I was into my account, there were the sorts of stories I&#39;d be interested in, and there were the couple of stories I&#39;d written. On iOS I logged in with my Twitter account and the same thing happened (I don&#39;t use and don&#39;t have an account on Facebook). It was than that I had to think about how I even logged into Medium normally (via the web, which is what I&#39;d always used up until now). Seems I&#39;d always used the Twitter login (which would make sense). So here&#39;s the thing that&#39;s got me wondering now: when I logged in with my Google account, how did it make the connection to my Twitter account? I mean, sure, there&#39;s got to be enough data kicking around to actually make the connection and it seems like a safe enough one to make but... huh? I must be missing something here though, it&#39;s as unexpected as it is handy. It&#39;s also worth noting that if you go to log in to the website Google accounts are not an option (there is a sub-option for &#34;Android Users&#34; where you have to create an account based off your email address, from what I can see). I&#39;m left trying to decide if I missed a step here, if this is clever, or if this is just plain creepy (and who&#39;s responsible for having made the connection). Edit to add: Cara from Medium was kind enough to notice my tweet pointing to this post and let me know the how and why of the above. Turns out it&#39;s what Rich suggested in the comments." />

    <p>I woke up this morning to find that one of my more recent favourite websites,
<a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, had finally released an Android application.
I'm more of an avid reader than a writer on there (I've only ever written
2 articles on there, and have toyed with the import facility too) so I imagine
the app won't make too much of a difference to me, but it was nice to see
that something that had been iOS-only was now on Android too.</p>
<p>I installed it on my Nexus 7 and Nexus 6 and then, given that
<a href="http://blog.davep.org/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I have an iOS device now</a>,
I installed it on that too. In doing so I noticed a very curious difference:</p>
<p><img alt="Medium login on Android" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-11-24-11.png"></p>
<p>vs:</p>
<p><img alt="Medium login on iOS" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Photo 25-06-2015 09 38 02.png"></p>
<p>Notice how Android has Google as an option whereas that's not an option on
iOS? The curious thing is, when I installed it on my Android devices,
I logged in with my Google account and it all just worked. I was into my
account, there were the sorts of stories I'd be interested in, and there were
the couple of stories I'd written.</p>
<p>On iOS I logged in with my Twitter account and the same thing happened (I
don't use and don't have an account on Facebook).</p>
<p>It was than that I had to think about how I even logged into Medium normally
(via the web, which is what I'd always used up until now). Seems I'd always
used the Twitter login (which would make sense).</p>
<p>So here's the thing that's got me wondering now: when I logged in with my
Google account, how did it make the connection to my Twitter account? I mean,
sure, there's got to be enough data kicking around to actually make the
connection and it seems like a safe enough one to make but... huh? I must be
missing something here though, it's as unexpected as it is handy.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that if you go to log in to the website Google accounts
are not an option (there is a sub-option for "Android Users" where you have
to create an account based off your email address, from what I can see).</p>
<p>I'm left trying to decide if I missed a step here, if this is clever, or if this
is just plain creepy (and who's responsible for having made the connection).</p>
<p><em>Edit to add:</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/caramev">Cara</a> from Medium was kind enough
to notice my tweet pointing to this post and <a href="https://twitter.com/caramev/status/614098764450496512">let me know the how and why of
