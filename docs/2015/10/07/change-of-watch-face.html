It&#39;s a wearable Android device that gives me handy info at a glance and lets me set reminders and things without even having to reach for my phone, tablet, Chromebook or desktop machine. This face fits perfectly into that. While it lacks the battery information (edit to add: it doesn&#39;t lack battery information, it&#39;s just an option that is off by default), and second time display, that Pujie Black has, it more than makes up for it with the rather fantastic display of weather and sunrise/set information -- especially how it displays temperature. This was enough to not only have me buy a copy, but also to switch to it. I&#39;m going to be sticking with it for the next couple of days to see how I feel about it and see if I miss any of the other information. This might be a little bit of change I can cope with." />

    <p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a creature of habit. Once I get used to
something I find it hard to change. In many areas of my life there has to be
really compelling reasons to change something. I've found that this is the
case with my Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>When I first got it it took me a couple or so days to find a face that I was
happy with and, in the end, I went with <a href="http://www.pujiewear.com/">Pujie Black</a>,
along with a colour scheme I set up myself (called <em>RGB</em>, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p><img alt="Pujie Black with RGB face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Pujie Black.png"></p>
<p>Today though I stumbled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.marscity.sunlight&amp;hl=en_GB">Krona Sunlight</a>.
This face really got my interest. Part of the reason is that, while what I'm
wearing is normally called a "watch", I don't see it as a watch (just like
my phone isn't really a phone). It's a wearable Android device that gives me
handy info at a glance and lets me set reminders and things without even
having to reach for my phone, tablet, Chromebook or desktop machine.</p>
<p>This face fits perfectly into that.</p>
<p><img alt="Krona Sunlight face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Krona Sunlight.png"></p>
<p>While it lacks the battery information (edit to add: it doesn't lack battery
information, it's just an option that is off by default), and second time display, that Pujie
Black has, it more than makes up for it with the rather fantastic display
of weather and sunrise/set information -- especially how it displays temperature.</p>
<p>This was enough to not only have me buy a copy, but also to switch to it. I'm
going to be sticking with it for the next couple of days to see how I feel
about it and see if I miss any of the other information.</p>
<p>This might be a little bit of change I can cope with.</p>
