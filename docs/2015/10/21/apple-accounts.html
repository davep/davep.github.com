<meta name="description" content="As much as I like my iMac, and as much as I am generally impressed with OS X the more I use it, I&#39;m constantly frustrated by the little issues I run into that make life so much more interesting and which fly in the face of the &#34;it just works with Apple&#34; fandom thing. The more I use the iMac, the more I appreciate that Macs and OS X are just as &#34;fun&#34; as anything running Windows. A little earlier was a good example. I wanted to share part of the iMac&#39;s filesystem using SMB. This seemed easy enough, the instructions on how to do it were clear and, after following them, it utterly failed. Brilliant. So I Googled the issue a bit and ran into this handy forum post. Apparently you can&#39;t actually connect with SMB if the account you&#39;re going to be using to connect with is using iCloud login rather than a separate login. Brilliant. Not an obvious thing. Nothing said this was the case. According to the forum post even Apple couldn&#39;t help the person who&#39;d been trying to make it work. But at least there was a workaround. All I&#39;d need to do is split the password, have a login for the machine that wasn&#39;t the iCloud login and I&#39;d be all good. I did it, it worked. I could browse the iMac&#39;s filesystem from my Windows machine and all was good (I&#39;d been able to do this the other way around for ages and with no problems whatsoever). Then I got curious. What would happen if, once I had this set up, I &#34;unsplit&#34; the password and went back to using the iCloud password to log in? That&#39;s when it got really fun. To do this it asks you for the current password and also your iCloud password. I entered both and... Yup. It refuses, every single time, to accept that the iCloud password I&#39;m entering is valid. Trust me, it is. I&#39;m entering the correct password. I can log in to the iCloud website with it just fine. But when I use it to try and &#34;unsplit&#34; my password.... nope. Brilliant. I&#39;ve even tried disabling SMB sharing for my account, and even turning off SMB sharing altogether. This doesn&#39;t seem to make any difference. Right now, as far as I can see, now that I&#39;ve split the password I can&#39;t go back despite the fact that there&#39;s a method of doing it made available. Brilliant." />

    <p>As much as I like my iMac, and as much as I am generally impressed with OS X
the more I use it, I'm constantly frustrated by the little issues I run into
that make life so much more interesting and which fly in the face of the
"it just works with Apple" fandom thing. The more I use the iMac, the more I
appreciate that Macs and OS X are just as "fun" as anything running Windows.</p>
<p>A little earlier was a good example. I wanted to share part of the iMac's
filesystem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">SMB</a>.
This seemed easy enough, the instructions on how to do it were clear and,
after following them, it utterly failed.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>So I Googled the issue a bit and ran into
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6629743?start=0&amp;tstart=0">this handy forum post</a>.
Apparently you can't actually connect with SMB if the account you're going to
be using to connect with is using iCloud login rather than a separate login.</p>

post even Apple couldn't help the person who'd been trying to make it work.
But at least there was a workaround. All I'd need to do is split the password,
have a login for the machine that <em>wasn't</em> the iCloud login and I'd be all good.</p>
