  <div>
      <div><p>It's five years ago this month that I bought myself my first macOS (then OS
X) device. After many years of having a Windows machine as my daily driver,
which was also my work machine (I worked from home), I decided it was high
time that I returned to having a Unix-a-like system on my desk too. For a
decade or so, starting in the later-90s, I'd had a GNU/Linux desktop. I
still had a Windows desktop (until a couple of years ago most of my work was
on DOS and Windows), but thanks to the wonders of a KVM, and later an X
server that ran on Windows, my personal hacking was done on a GNU/Linux
desktop.</p>
<p>But as things moved around, priorities changed, as life moved on, the
GNU/Linux boxes got retired and never quite replaced. Eventually, in 2015, I
found myself with the means and desire to recover that sort of setup. Long
story short, after a lot of reading up and weighing up options I decided
that the best option for a desktop Unix was... an iMac!</p>
<p>I loved it. Sure, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">there were lots of little things on the surface that were
different or annoying or just plain not as cool as the Mac fans would tell
you</a>,
but under the hood I found what I needed: a Unix CLI with all the things I
knew well. And, of course, it ran GNU Emacs just fine; that was the really
important thing for me.</p>
<p>Pretty much right away I decided that it might be fun to learn the tools
necessary to develop native Mac apps, and perhaps even iOS apps. I
downloaded XCode, bought a book, and started working through it. Having got
that book, I decided it might be interesting to own an iOS device too. So,
sort of needing an MP3 player, and having no wish to get an iPhone, <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I got
myself an iPod
Touch</a>. So I
was all set to devour the Swift book, write some stuff for OS X, create an
iOS app or two, and... life happened. Stuff cropped up that distracted me
from taking that further and I never really returned to working through the
book.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now and that initial iMac and iPod purchase spiralled a wee
bit. Next after the iPod was an iPad Mini, when my Nexus 7 was starting to
show its age and it was obvious that Google wasn't going to produce any more
good Android tablets. Then, when I needed a very portable Unix-a-like
machine for trips between where I was living and Edinburgh, <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">I got myself a
MacBook Air</a>.
Since then the iPod Touch has been replaced once, as has the iPad Mini. I
now also own an iPad and a MacBook Pro. Unless Apple screw up and turn Macs
into something unusable for developers (there are rumours), I imagine I'll
be using Apple devices for some time to come now.</p>
<p>And then, last month, having finally got frustrated with where Google were
going with Android and the Pixel series, I jumped ship to the iPhone 11.</p>
<p>As of right now I'm in a situation where I'm all about the Apple ecosystem
regarding hardware and operating systems (including for my work machine),
all of which is there to support my heavy use of the Google ecosystem
(actually, the one bit of Google hardware I still lean on heavily is the
Google Home -- I have 3 around my home).</p>
<p>So... given all of that, I thought it was time to look at returning to
learning Swift, with a view to writing some native macOS and i(Pad)OS stuff.
I soon realised that the book I'd bought back in 2015 was rather out of
date. It covers Swift 1.2 -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Version_history">we're now up to
5.2</a>!
Given this, and given I've forgotten pretty much everything I'd read at the
time, I decided I should start again from scratch.</p>
<p>This weekend I've started reading my way though <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ios-13-programming/9781492074526/"><em>iOS Programming
Fundamentals with
Swift</em></a>.
While this obviously has an emphasis on iOS, I'm already finding that the
first part of the book is a really great introduction to the Swift language
in general. The pace seems just right, and the way topics are grouped makes
it easy enough for me to skip over what's obvious (I don't need to know what
objected-oriented programming is, and what the difference between a class
and an object is, etc) and read up on the detail of this particular language
when it comes to general concepts I know (knowing the differences between a
class, struct and enum in the language is important, for example).</p>
<p>I've yet to write a line of code, but I'm fine with that. The book is
spending a lot of time introducing the language before encouraging you to
fire up XCode, and I'm okay with that. I'm never a fan of being asked to
write out code that I can't properly follow -- that just makes stuff look
like magic when it's far more educational to know what's going on. What I am
finding is I'm making lots of notes that are either <em>"oh, yeah, this is
cool, I like this idea!"</em> or <em>"WTF are you kidding me?!?"</em>. Which is really
nice -- it's always great to learn a new language that's a bit different
from what you normally use.</p>
<p>My plan then, over the next few weeks, it to keep at this and hopefully
document my journey. I think I'd like to write a short series of TIL-type
posts; nothing too long, just some new thing I read or discovered and my
reaction to it. So, if you happen to follow this blog, I apologise in
advance for any Swift-spam.</p>
<p>You have been warned. ;-)</p></div>

      <div><p>It's no surprise that I spend a lot of time in Emacs. Especially when I'm
developing software, either for work or for personal fun, most of my time is
time spent in Emacs. While I do obviously flit over to Chrome, and mostly do
my CLI stuff in <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> (I really like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">eshell</a>
but it just can't replace a good terminal for me), I spend a lot of time
looking at Emacs.</p>
<p>Here's what my Emacs looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 13.49.04.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 13.49.04.png"></p>
<p>Key elements for me are as follows:</p>
<h1>Light background</h1>
<p>Something I've never really got on with when it comes to code editing is
dark themes and dark backgrounds. I find it too much of an eye strain.
Oddly, I tend to prefer dark themes everywhere else, but not when it comes
to working in Emacs. The theme I use is <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/init-style.el#L12-L13">the built-in adwaita
theme</a>.</p>
<h1>Less boring mode line</h1>
<p>I make use of <a href="https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline">powerline</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L386-L399">make the mode line a bit less
boring-looking</a>.
While the colour scheme is such that it's kept in line with the light look,
the style is nice in that it sort of matches the style of prompt I use in my
shell.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.05.39.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.05.39.png"></p>
<h1>Full screen</h1>
<p>I always run Emacs as a full-screen application, then splitting it into
different tiled windows using its own internal window handling. This is
something I've done from way back when I got started with my first GNU/Linux
desktop machine, and still like to do on macOS.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el">run Emacs as a server</a> and
then use <a href="https://github.com/davep/e">a little wrapper around <code>emacsclient</code></a>
to open files (both locally and remotely) from the command line in that
Emacs session.</p>
<h1>Comfortable eshell when I need it</h1>
<p>Although I say above that I generally don't use <code>eshell</code>, preferring to use
a full-featured terminal application, in combination with
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>, I do sometimes dip into eshell for quick
things. So of course I have that configured to feel comfortable too.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.10.07.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.10.07.png"></p>
<p>I do this easily <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L181-L192">thanks to
<code>eshell-git-prompt</code></a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>By coincidence, in a couple of different places over the last couple of
weeks, the subject of <em>"how do I progress in leaning to program?"</em> has
cropped up. For me, I think the approaches and solutions tend to be the same
for when I want to get my head around a new language: read good examples of
idiomatic code, read other related materials, find a problem you care about
and implement a solution (ideally something you'll directly benefit from, or
at least others may benefit from). Hence the <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">5x5 puzzle and Norton Guide
reader projects I mentioned in my previous
post</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has problems that they need solving in a way that
would work for this approach. So another approach I've recommended in the
past is to go looking on somewhere like GitHub and find projects that
promote "low-hanging fruit" issues in a way that's designed to be friendly
for those who are new to development, new to contributing or new to the
problem domain.</p>
<p>While looking for examples of this yesterday I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners"><em>Awesome for
Beginners</em></a>. This looks
like a great list and one I'm going to keep <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep/">bookmarked for future
reference</a>. Now, this particular list does
seem to have an emphasis on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/issues/215">pulling in people who are new to contributing
to a project</a>
rather than new to development, but it does strike me as a good place to
start looking no matter where you're coming from.</p>
<p>I know I'm going to start having a wander around that list. It's always nice
to contribute and I feel there's real personal benefit in actively solving a
problem that someone else has and welcomes help with.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>These days <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> is my shell of choice. I started
out with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> back in the 1990s, went
through a bit of a
<a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>/<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> phase, but
earlier this year finally settled on fish.</p>
<p>At some point I might write a post about my fish config, and why fish works
well for me. But that's an idea for another time.</p>
<p>In this post I thought I'd share a little snippet of code that can come in
handy now and again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find myself inside a git repo, in the shell, and I want to get
to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29">forge</a>" for
that repo. This is most often either on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, or in
a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/">company-local installation of GitLab</a>.
To get there quickly I wrote
<a href="https://gist.github.com/davep/3bac3b30e45a3560c265150e609219db"><code>gh.fish</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">##############################################################################</span>

<p>The idea is pretty simple: I see if the repo has an origin of some
description and, if it has, I <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#string">slice and dice
it</a> into something
that looks like the URL you'd expect to find for a GitHub or GitLab repo.
Finally I use
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#open"><code>open</code></a> to open the
URL in the environment's browser of choice.</p></div>

      <div><p>Like many programmers, I have a couple of "Hello, World" projects that I've
carried with me over the years. One is 5x5 (which has been used to get to
grips with things as diverse as the Palm Pilot and GNU emacs). Another
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides">Norton Guides database</a>
<a href="http://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">readers</a>.</p>
<p>I've made Norton Guides tools that have allowed web servers to serve guides
(<code>w3ng</code>), that have allowed you to convert guides to HTML (<code>ng2html</code>), that
have let you read guides on OS/2 and GNU/Linux (<code>eg</code>) and also have let you
read guides in Microsoft Windows (<code>weg</code>). It's a problem I know fairly well
and one where I know the solution well enough so I can concentrate on
learning the new language or environment.</p>
<p>Recently I wanted to get to grips with some
"pure" <a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ES6</a> coding while also getting
to know <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>. A new version of the Norton Guide
code, written for this environment, seemed like a good thing to do.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG">jsNG</a> was born.</p>
<p>At its core is <a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG/tree/master/lib">a library of code for opening and reading data from Norton
Guides databases</a>. While I
doubt it's good ES6 code, or even good node.js code, it's been very useful
in giving me a fun problem to solve and it'll carry on being something I'll
tweak and tinker with by way of trying new things out.</p>
<p>On top of this I've built a handful of tools for working with Norton Guides
databases. The most useful one at the moment (the others are more in the
"test the library" than the "make something handy with the library"
category) is <code>ngserve</code>. This is designed as a simple Norton Guides database
HTTP server.</p>
<p><img alt="ngserve in action" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.10.18.png"></p>
<p>When run, you give it a list of guides to serve:</p>
<p><img alt="Starting ngserve" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.26.44.png"></p>
<p>and it does the right thing. It has a small number of command line options
that help configure what it does:</p>
<p><img alt="ngserve command line options" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.29.28.png"></p>
<p>Possibly the most useful are the ones that let you change how it handles
"higher" DOS characters and, if you don't like the default colours and
stuff, the option that lets you point to your own style sheet (note for now
you'll need to host the stylesheet somewhere else -- ngserve won't serve it
for you; I'm aiming to change that in some way in the near future).</p>
<p>jsNG does have a fairly basic design compromise at its heart. In the very
early version I started out using the async functions for opening and
reading the guides. This got very tedious very quickly and I could see that
it was going to make for a very messy library with a very messy interface.
While it might not be in the spirit of node.js programming I decided to go
with the sync version of the file IO functions and code up the core library
based around this.</p>
<p>This approach also means that I took another leap that I never have done
with Norton Guides before: rather than doing the traditional thing of
keeping an open handle into them and reading direct from the file as you
navigate the guide, I simply read it all into a buffer in one go and keep it
in memory. This is a "guides are small, memory is cheap, things will go
faster" approach.</p>
<p>It does mean that when you load up a load of guides into <code>ngserve</code> they're
all sat in memory. The upside of this is that things should be a lot faster
and the code is a lot easier to follow (I think). To put this in some
perspective: I have a directory here that contains 110 Norton Guides files.
They total 36M in size. If that seems like a lot of stuff to hold in
memory... remind me how much is being used by your web browser so you can
look at some hilarious kittens. ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, that's where I'm at with it right now. The code is mostly settled
and mostly tidy. I need to write up some documentation for it (and so I need
to take a look at good JavaScript documentation tools) and perhaps tinker
with <code>ngserve</code> a little more. I'd also like to do a new version of <code>ng2html</code>
with this -- a version that makes it <em>far</em> easier to control the style of
the output. I'm also tempted to do a CLI-based reader in pure ES6; something
similar to <code>EG</code> or <code>WEG</code>.</p>
<p>All in good time.</p></div>
