  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Some time around late October or early November last year, around the time I
started working at <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>, I "discovered"
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. While I didn't need another note-taking
application (having gone through Evernote, trying to use
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a>, dabbling with a couple of other things and
finally settling mainly on Apple Notes), I was quite taken by its style and
ubiquity and the fact that it was, at heart, just a bunch of Markdown files.</p>
<p>So quite quickly I started using it; not to replace Apple Notes (which is
still my general note-taking tool of choice), but to keep work notes and a
daily coding journal, the latter coming in useful for the quick end-of-day
meetings we normally have.</p>
<p>One of the things I was quite taken by was the graph. It was interesting and
fun to see how each of my work days related to other work days, and what
subjects kept getting pulled in, etc.</p>
<p>So come the start of this year I had an idea: what would it be like to keep
a personal vault, but one where I track things I've done. Not a journal as
such (I do keep one of those too, have done for many years now, but that's
for other far more important reasons -- perhaps I'll write about that one
day too), just a daily record of stuff I've achieved, stuff I've actually
done, the routine things and the exceptional things?</p>
<p>What would that graph look like?</p>
<p>While it's not the end of this year yet, here's how that's shaping up:</p>
<p><img alt="The main graph" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/MainGraph.png#centre"></p>
<p>Each of the yellow circles is a day, each of the blue ones is a tag of some
sort. As you'd imagine, the size of the circles relates to how often that
item is tagged. So I can see what proportion of my days so far this year
have been tagged with being heavily involved with work:</p>
<p><img alt="Work" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Work.png#centre"></p>
<p>Likewise, if I want to see how many days this year have involved a
significant spot of gaming:</p>
<p><img alt="Gaming" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Gaming.png#centre"></p>
<p>Ditto for days where I've done some coding on pet projects, or even some
personal-time coding relating to work projects (it might be work, but it's
also Free Software and I do like to support FOSS!)</p>
<p><img alt="Coding" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Coding.png#centre"></p>
<p>I sort of have a curated set of tags I apply, but I've not made it a strict
set; if some new situation crops up that calls for a new tag I'll use it.
Mostly though I try and keep the tags pretty general so lots of days can
relate to the same general subject.</p>
<p>Another thing I've done is tag each and every day with the day of the week,
so while it's not really surprising to find that Sunday doesn't dominate
over other days, I can see which days are Sundays and perhaps wander along
the connections and see what I get up to:</p>
<p><img alt="Sunday" src="/attachments/2023/09/11/Sunday.png#centre"></p>
<p>I don't quite know what I hope to get out of this, I don't really know if
there's anything useful to be had here at all, but it will be interesting to
look back over it at the end of the year. It also means that I'll have a
directory hierarchy full of Markdown files, all tagged and filled with
information, which I'll be able to <code>grep</code> and slice and dice and count and
perhaps pull into a database and cross-reference with stuff and things.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it's all just really me not having a good use for Obsidian but
inventing one anyway. ;-)</p></div>

      <div><p>And I'm done! While it did only turn out to be one a week, <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">I pulled it
off</a>, I managed to make it to at
least one Fringe show per week!</p>
<p><img alt="View inside the Roxy" src="/attachments/2023/08/27/IMG_2834.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Yesterday was a full, busy, and hugely enjoyable day. While it could have
just been a dash into town to see the show and back home again, in
conjunction with <a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle">Mariëlle</a> (who <a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html">first
introduced me to the Mythos show</a>)
we arranged to go watch Oppenheimer first (amazing, easily the fastest any
combined 3 hours have passed for me -- I'm not even going to try and write
up anything about this, other than I was utterly enthralled by the movie
from start to end), grab some dinner, <em>then</em> go and see <em>Mythos: Ragnarok</em>.</p>
<p>With a wee bit of shopping thrown in along the way.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I first saw Ragnarok last year. Then they were in
a fairly small venue, with a pretty full crowd. At the end they talked about
how the first night they'd played the audience had been a single person;
over the nights of the run it had slowly grown, and by the end of the run
(we went on the last night) it was getting properly busy.</p>
<p>This year they were in a <a href="https://assemblyfestival.com/venues/61_assembly-roxy"><em>much</em> bigger
place</a>, with a lot
more seating, and the house was full. This did make it feel a little less
intimate than last year, and also last year we were sat all around the
stage, which worked well for the performance; this time around it was a more
traditional stage at the front, seating all on one side thing. I was really
pleased for them that they were in a much bigger place, but I did miss the
layout from last year.</p>
<p>As for the show itself... just as fantastic. There seemed to have been some
tweaks and changes to how the story was done over what I remember from last
year, but mainly it was the same. The energy in the performance was
incredible, and the comedy was spot on, with a lot of nods and winks to the
audience. This is the part that I think I enjoy most: they know what they
have, they know what they're doing, they know what they have on offer. It's
a high-energy play performed by stunt people.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>

<p></center></p>
<p>As I write this there's one last show, I believe, tonight; so the chances of
anyone reading this and getting to see it are very remote. But if they're
back next year, and you're reading this near then and wondering about Fringe
shows, do it! Really, do it. You won't regret it.</p>
<p>I'll be going again. No question.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html">just over a week
back</a>, last night I went to see a
Fringe show that was a production of <em>The Little Shop of Horrors</em>. Before
going I had no idea what to expect (in terms of how it would be done, not
what the content would be): I wasn't clear if it would be a really small
affair, or something on a bigger stage with reasonably high production
values (what can I say? It was LSoH, it was a Fringe show, it was booked
knowing nothing else).</p>
<p>When we got there and got into the venue it was... small, oh so very small!
No real set to speak of. The cast who were about to kick off the performance
didn't really seem to have much of a costume going on. So, without
judgement, I settled down to expect the next 90 minutes or so to be... a
Fringe experience.</p>
<p>First impressions were oh so wrong! While there was (for obvious reasons) a
lack of any real set, the effort that went into the performance really
worked and I absolutely enjoyed every single moment. Also, because it was a
production of the musical (which I haven't seen), rather than an adaption of
the movie (which I have), I got to experience a fresh ending (spoilers!).</p>
<p>The seats were uncomfortable. The room was down in the basement, with no
ventilation, and so was uncomfortably hot. Physically it wasn't a great
space to be. And yet I really wasn't wishing for it to be over. I think that
says a lot about the show itself.</p>
<p>I think special mention has to be given to the Audrey II models, of which
there were three different sizes. Someone put some real effort into them.</p>
<p>So, yeah, a fun night, topped and tailed with pre-show dinner and post-show
drinks with friends. I couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>Unless I last-moment book anything else over the next week, <a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html">there's one
more show to go</a> in my <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">push to go
and see at least one show per week of the
Fringe</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Sadly no photos. I wasn't sat in a great spot to take photos.</p></div>

      <div><p>That's a third show booked! This means that, <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html#off-to-see-nick-harper">as I
hoped</a>, I'm
going to manage at least one show a week for the Fringe!</p>
<p>Now, this one could be seen as a cheat, sorta, kinda. I've seen this show
before. But I liked it so much last year I <em>have</em> to see it again! The odd
thing about it was it's not something I would have gone for on my own, it's
technically not really my thing, but I got talked into it and I'm so glad I
was!</p>
<p>So a year back <a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle">Mariëlle</a> told me about
this wrestling show at the Fringe and how she wanted to go but nobody else
was interested and I was all <em>"yebbut wrestling though?"</em> and didn't think
much more about it. Eventually though, after some persuasion (I mean, an
hour or so at a show and some beers afterwards, how bad could it be
really?), I agreed to go. I expected to find it meh.</p>
<p><img alt="Cast of Mythos: Ragnarok 2022" src="/attachments/2023/08/15/IMG_7612.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Holy shit was it so much fun! Like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37r1CqMKLzM">seriously so much
fun</a>. I'd never realised that
wrestling was the best way to tell the tales from Norse mythology; turns out
that wrestling is absolutely the best way to tell the tales from Norse
mythology.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mythos-ragnarok">we're off back again this
year</a>. All booked,
not this weekend, the weekend after.</p>
<p>There might even be a beer afterwards. Perhaps not <em>quite</em> so many as last
year though.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">about a week back</a>,
my first show booked for this year's Edinburgh Fringe was to see <a href="https://harperspace.com/home">Nick
Harper</a>. It's been a long time since I've seen
him; far too long. As best as I can tell the last gig I made it to was in
2009.</p>
<p>Fourteen years. Shit's changed in that time, for me, for the world. O_o</p>
<p>On first getting into town it was warm and crowded, with that fun "town is
doing festival shit" vibe that I like, so I went and grabbed an ice cream to
kill some time until the venue opened. I knew I was in the right spot when,
as I stood on Chambers Street, enjoying the cooldown, the man himself dashed
passed, guitar case in hand!</p>
<p>When I got into the venue I grabbed a drink and tried to find a seat; most
were taken; except for one right at the front and off to the side. So I
grabbed it. Moments later Nick himself came over to say hello to the folk
sat in this spot. We had a wee chat about how long it was since I'd last
seen him, nattered about general stuff, and he said very nice things about
my hat.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2682.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>The gig itself was fantastic. While I love his recorded work anyway, Nick's
always been one of those artists who I enjoy most live. He's got this way of
singing and playing guitar that fills whatever time he's got to play; never
once have I ever found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it's near
the end; or if I have it's because I'm worried it'll be over soon.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2684.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>A good number of the tracks he played I didn't recognise; at least two of
them I know are from a new album that's coming, and I have to admit that
when I do listen to his stuff it's the earlier works that tend to go into
heavy rotation (I think the last album of his I bought was <em>The Last
Guitar</em>). But I loved everything I got to hear. I'll be diving back into
<a href="https://harperspace.com/shop">his catalogue</a> and also keeping an eye out
for the new release.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2689.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>While there was only an hour for his slot, he did manage to get a couple of
old favourites of mine in; I was delighted when he launched into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQAebSpqVw">By My
Rocket Comes Fire</a>, did a
wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH6TqeeM5ZY">She Rules My World</a>,
and even squeezed in a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yz7mQ_i6pg">Galaxy
Song</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2705.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>All too quickly though, the hour was up. It was kind of fitting that many of
the songs he did have on the set list were all about time (on purpose, I'm
sure). I'm happy to say I got to say a quick thank you and goodbye and then
it was time for me to head out of town again.</p>
<p><img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2701.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Seeing Nick brought back a lot of good memories, and reminded me that I need
to catch up on his more recent works. While most of his stuff doesn't seem
to be on Apple Music (what can I say, I'm very online these days when it
comes to music), I'm glad to see <a href="https://nickharper.bandcamp.com/">he's got a full
Bandcamp</a>, so I'll be paying that a visit!</p>
<p>I hope he swings back this way some time soon, not during the Fringe, and
with a proper long set. It's been too long since I got to enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTD03-3qgmg">him really
going for it and having a ton of
fun</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)">Little Shop of
Horrors</a> for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.</p>
<p>And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.</p>
<p>Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.</p>
<p>So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="Poser for Little Shop of Horrors" src="/attachments/2023/08/10/IMG_2652.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html">a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would</a>, this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you <em>seen</em> how much there is on offer?).</p>
<p>So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors">a performance of Little Shop of
Horrors</a>.</p></div>

<p>I've lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside
form the odd show here and there, I've never really <em>done</em> the Fringe. As
in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn't quite
allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every
year I've been up here I've managed one show, at least, but this year I want
to try and make myself get to a few.</p>
<p>Maybe one per week. Possibly.</p>
<p>Might not happen, but I'm going to try. What can I say? I don't live <em>in</em>
Edinburgh, I'm not a big "be out amongst people" kind of person, and the
activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little
part of Scotland is a constant battle.</p>
<p>But this year I'm going to try my best.</p>
<p>This evening I've booked a ticket for an artist I've been a fan of since the
1990s: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harper">Nick Harper</a>. I saw Nick
quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I <em>think</em> 2009 might be
the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat
(again, life stuff). So seeing that <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/5-nights-in-harperspace">he's playing here for a few
days</a> was
something I could not ignore.</p>
<p>This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something
kinda sociable. I'm sure he'll be mad at me most of the day it's happening,
but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he'll be thankful.</p>
<p>Right now, at this moment... I'm rather looking forward to it.</p></div>

      <div><p>Anyone who was (un)lucky enough to follow me on Twitter back in 2020 will
know that, starting January 1st that year, I set about losing weight. At the
time I was <em>very</em> overweight and wanted to get into some sort of healthy
state. By August that year I'd managed to drop 30kg and hit and then went a
wee way under my goal.</p>
<p>These days I'm back up a wee bit. Not much: generally about 5kg or so above
that goal, most of that having turned up on the last 7 or 8 months (not
exactly coincidental that it's happened in conjunction with the new job, the
new work location, and the new commute). While it's no real cause for
concern -- I'm still generally careful and still get plenty of exercise
(normally walk around 35km a week, run 20km, get my 10k steps in every day)</p>
<p>About a week back I decided that it was time to give myself a bit of
breathing room, to try and at least drop a couple or kg; so with that in
mind I set a lower daily calorie goal in my tacking app.</p>
<p>When recording my weight first thing this morning (yes, I'm one of those
people who records it every day and have for a few years -- it makes for
interesting data!), this is what my calorie/stats tracker had to say:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my calorie and weight tracking app" src="/attachments/2023/07/21/IMG_2475.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I guess it's putting a positive spin in things? (for the record, I'm 5.3kg
<em>above</em> my absolute goal).</p></div>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I moved into my current place back in August 2019, bringing with me a fairly
small desk. Originally, many years back, I'd had a pretty big office with
<em>lots</em> of office space but, upon moving up to Scotland back in 2016, I
needed to go with something a lot smaller.</p>
<p>Which was perfectly fine. Me and that desk wrote a lot of code. Me and that
desk <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">transitioned from one job to
another</a>, and then
<a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">another</a>. Me and that desk made
it through the pandemic.</p>
<p>It's been a good desk.</p>
<p>But it was small. I'm in a place where I could spread out a fair bit again,
but I also kept putting it off and putting it off.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I decided that it was high time I actually upgraded; I
also promised the desk to someone else who I know will get a <em>lot</em> of good
use out of it; so finally earlier this week I put in the order for something
bigger and fancier.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the help of a very good friend (thanks Mariëlle!), I got the
desk built and roughly in place, and then today I've been putting the
desktop back together and adding extra bits.</p>
<p><img alt="My new desk" src="/attachments/2023/07/08/new-desk.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>It's so nice to have more space to spread out, it's also nice to have a
black desk again! (the last one was white because... reasons) But what's
<em>really</em> exciting is that it transforms into a standing desk at the touch of
a button.</p>
<p>I've been trying it in the standing configuration today and, while I doubt I
could do a whole day of coding with it like that, I'm already really liking
it as a way of breaking up the time at the keyboard. On the days I work from
home, or the days of my own where I get sucked into a personal project, I
can absolutely see me swapping between the two states.</p>
<p>All that's left now is to get used to it. The screens are ever so slightly
further away, the height is ever so slightly different (although I can
adjust it, of course, but what I've done is adjust the sitting position to a
nicer one and that's going to take some getting used to), my iPad and Stream
Desk are in just a slightly different location, etc, etc... So I'm sure
there'll be a few days of sitting here and making small tweaks to the spot
where things live.</p>
<p>Before I know it I'll be used to it. It'll be "my spot".</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Just over five years ago I got a message from my then employer to say I was
going to be made redundant after 21 years working for them. After the 3
month notice period the final day came. Meanwhile, I found something new
that <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">looked terrifying but
interesting</a>. In the end it was less
terrifying and way more interesting than I imagined it would be. It was fun
too.</p>
<p>But... (there's always a but isn't there?)</p>
<p>In the four and change years I've been there the company got bought out, and
then the result of that got bought up. As I've mentioned before I'm
generally not a "big company" kind of person; in all my years I've found
that I'm happier working in a smaller place. After a couple of buyouts my
employer had gone from being 10s of people in size to 100s of people in size
(and technically 10s of 1,000s of people in size depending on how you look
at it).</p>
<p>This change in ownership and size meant the culture became... well, let's
just say not as friendly as you tend to enjoy when it's a smaller group of
folk. On top of that I was starting to notice that my efforts were making
less of an impact as things got bigger, and I started to feel like my
contributions weren't really relevant any more. There were some problematic
things happening too: undermining of efforts, removal of responsibilities
without consultation or communication, that sort of thing. Plus worse.
There's little point in going into the detail, but it's fair to say that
work wasn't as fun as it used to be.</p>
<p>That felt like a good time to start to look around. If work makes you feel
unhappy and you can look around... look around.</p>
<p>Thing is, I wasn't sure what to look for. I was in the comfortable position
of, unlike last time, not <em>needing</em> to find something, so I could take my
time at least. Over the course of the last year I've spoken to many
different companies and organisations, some big (yes, I know, I said I don't
like big places -- sometimes what's on offer deserves a fair hearing), some
small, but none of them quite said <em>"this feels like me"</em>. In some cases the
whole thing didn't have the right vibe, in others the industry either didn't
interest me, or felt uncomfortable given my personal values. In one
particular case a place looked interesting until I checked the CTO's socials
and OMG NO NO NO AVOID AVOID (that was a fun one).</p>
<p>Then I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan">Will McGugan</a> saying he was
hiring to expand <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>. This caught my
interest right away for two good reasons.</p>
<p>I can't remember how long I've been following Will on Twitter; I likely
stumbled on him as I got back into Python in 2018 and I also remember noting
that he was a Python hacker just up the road from me. We'd vaguely chatted
on Twitter, briefly, in that "Twitter acquaintance" way we all often do (I
remember <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1438887277623750661">one brief exchange about fungus on The
Meadows</a>), and
he'd seemed like a good sort. A small company run by a "good sort" kinda
person felt like a damn good reason.</p>
<p>The second reason was Textual itself. I'd been watching Will develop it, in
open, with great interest. I had (and still have) a plan to write a brand
new CHUI-based (okay fine TUI-based as the kids like to say these days!)
Norton Guide reader, all in Python, and Textual looked like the perfect
framework to do the UI in. The chance to be involved with it sounded
awesome.</p>
<p>Now, I said two reasons, but there's also a third I guess: Will's pitch for
applying to Textualize felt so damn accessible! I'm on the older end of the
age range of this industry; for much of my working life as a developer I've
worked in isolation from other developers; while I first touched Python in
the 90s, I've only been using it in anger since 2018 and still feel like
I've got a lot to learn. Despite all these things, and more, saying <em>"aye
Dave this is beyond you"</em> I felt comfortable dropping Will a line.</p>
<p>Which resulted in a chat.</p>
<p>Which resulted in some code tinkering and chatting.</p>
<p>Which resulted in...</p>
<p>Something new.</p>
<p>So, yeah, as of 2022-10-10 I'm on yet another new adventure. Time for me to
<em>really</em> work on my Python coding as I work with Will and the rest of the
team as part of Textualize.</p>
<p>Or, as I put it on Twitter a few days ago: <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1574121611413921792">I'm going to be a Python
impostor syndrome
speedrunner</a>!</p></div>
