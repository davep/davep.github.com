  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>After having knocked up <a href="/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html">obs2nlm the other day</a> I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: <a href="/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html">one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection</a>!</p>
<p>And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as <code>obs2nlm</code>, only it
uses <a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev"><code>ngdb</code></a> to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be working a treat.</p>
<p><img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre"></p>
<p>Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.</p>
<p>I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a <em>long</em>
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I <em>think</em> this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What are all the numbers in square brackets for?</p>
<p><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source <em>and linking to it</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre"></p>
<p>so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.</p>
<p>If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:</p>
<p><img alt="No citations in the code" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, given this, perhaps I can use the
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions"><code>--additional-instructions</code></a>
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak <code>ng2nlm</code> itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> exists.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I'm sure I've mentioned a couple of times before that I've become quite the
fan of <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. For the past few years, at any given
point, I've had a couple of vaults on the go. Generally I find such vaults a
really useful place to record things I'd otherwise forget, and of course as
a place to go back and look things up.</p>
<p>But... even then, it's easy enough to forget what you might have recorded
and know that you can even go back and look things up. Also I tend to find
that I can't quite figure out a good way of getting a good overview of what
I've recorded, over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: I've been playing around with Google's
<a href="https://notebooklm.google.com">NotebookLM</a> as a tool to help research and
understand various topics. After doing this with my recent winter break
coding project (more on that in the future) I realised I really should get
serious about taking this approach with my Obsidian Vaults.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is far from novel, I'm sure lots of people have done similar
things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea <a href="https://github.com/davep/vault2source">a few months
ago</a>, had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://obs2nlm.davep.dev">obs2nlm</a> was born.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.</p>
<p>So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I <em>know</em> the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.</p>
<p>Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
<a href="/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html">I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things</a> and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in <a href="https://journey.cloud">Journey</a> for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a>,
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>. It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm">obs2nlm</a> will be handy for you.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As I've mentioned a <a href="/tag/norton-guide.html">few times on this blog</a>, I've
long had a bit of a thing for <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">writing tools for reading the content of
Norton Guide files</a>. I first used
Norton Guides back in the early 1990s thanks to the release of Clipper 5,
and later on in that decade I wrote my first couple of tools to turn guides
into HTML (and also wrote a Windows-based reader, then rewrote it, wrote one
for OS/2, wrote one for GNU/Linux, and so on).</p>
<p>One tool (<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html"><code>ng2html</code></a>) got used by a few
sites on the 'net to publish all sorts of guides, but it's not something I
ever got into doing myself. Amusingly, from time to time, because I had a
credit on those sites as the author of the conversion tool, I'd get random
emails from people hoping I could help them with the topic of whatever guide
they'd been reading. Sometimes I could help, often not.</p>
<p>From what I've recently been told two of the biggest sites for this sort of
thing (they might even have been the same site, or one a copy of the other,
I didn't really dive into them too much and wasn't sure who was behind them
anyway) have long since gone offline. This means that, as far as I can tell,
a huge collection of knowledge from the DOS days is a lot harder to get to,
if it hasn't disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>This makes me kind of sad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> digging a little, one of the sites was called
<code>www.clipx.net</code> and it looks to have long-since gone offline. It is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213123739/http://www.clipx.net/ng/">on
archive.org though</a>.
The other was <code>x-hacker.org</code> which, digging a wee bit more, seems to have
been a copy of what was on clipx.net.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I had an idea: having <a href="/2025/03/24/ng2web.html">recently polished up my replacement for
ng2html</a>, why not use that to build my own site
that publishes the guides I have? So I set about it.</p>
<p>There's one wrinkle to this though. While the other sites seemed to just
publish every NG file they got their hands on, I'd prefer to try and do it
like this: publish every guide I have in my collection <em>that I have a
licence or permission to publish</em>; or as near as possible<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Given all of this,
<a href="https://norton-guides.davep.dev">norton-guides.davep.dev</a> has been born.
The repository that drives it <a href="https://github.com/davep/norton-guides">is on
GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/davep/norton-guides/wiki">I have a wiki
page</a> that lists all the guides
I have that I could possibly publish, showing what I know about the
copyright/licence of each one and what the publishing state is.</p>
<p><img alt="Snapshot of the site" src="/attachments/2025/12/12/norton-guides.png"></p>
<p>So with this, I'm putting out a call for help: if you remember the days of
Norton Guide help files, if you have Norton Guide help files I don't have,
and especially if you are the copyright-holder of any of these files and you
can extend me the permission to open them up, or if you know the right
people and can get me in touch with them, <a href="mailto:davep@davep.org">DROP ME A LINE</a>!</p>
<p>I'd also love to have others join me in this... quest. So if you want to
contribute to the repository and help build it up I'd also love to hear from
you.</p>

      <div><p><a href="https://dhv.davep.dev/"><img alt="DHV" src="/attachments/2025/07/19/dhv-social-banner.png"></a></p>
<p>Back in the very early days of my involvement with
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>, while looking for fun things to
build to test out the framework and find problems with it, I created
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview"><code>textual-astview</code></a>. The idea was
pretty simple: exercise Textual's
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tree/"><code>Tree</code></a> widget by using it to
display the output of Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">abstract syntax tree
module</a>.</p>
<p>While the code still works, Textual has moved on a lot, as has my approach
to building applications with Textual, and so I've been wanting to do a
ground-up rewrite of it. At the same time I was also thinking that it might
be interesting to build a tool that provides other ways of understanding how
your Python source gets turned into runnable code; with this in mind I've
ended up building a terminal-based application called DHV.</p>
<p><a href="https://dhv.davep.dev/"><img alt="DHV in action" src="/attachments/2025/07/19/dhv.gif"></a></p>
<p>The idea is pretty straightforward: you type in, paste in, or load up,
Python code, and you get a real-time display of what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html">resulting
bytecode</a> and abstract syntax
tree would be.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a particular bit of code looks like under the
hood, or wondered if one particular approach to a problem is "more
efficient"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> than another, or just wondered to yourself if <code>1+1</code> ends up
being a complex operation or simply gets turned into <code>2</code>, this tool might be
useful to experiment and see.</p>
<p>As of now DHV only works with Python 3.13. The main reason for this is that
the Python <code>dis</code> module is a bit of a moving target and has had some
noticeable interface changes over the past few versions. When I find some
time I might work on making DHV a little more backward-compatible. But for
now keep this in mind: when you're looking at the results for some code
you're looking at what Python 3.13 (or later) would do, earlier Pythons may
differ.</p>
<p>DHV is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/dhv">via

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">Norton Guide readers</a> or
the <a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories&amp;q=5x5&amp;type=&amp;language=&amp;sort=">5x5
puzzle</a>,
code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto
exercises. I've written versions in many languages, and messed with plots in
some different environments, as varied as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ytRZrHL34">in VR on the
web</a> to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Self-Documenting-Mandelbrot-by-davepearson/1341910.0S66D">wearable
items</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">my involvement with
Textualize</a> I
<a href="https://github.com/davep/trMandelbrot">wrote a deliberately worst-approach
version</a> using that framework. The
whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also
stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job.</p>
<p>Later on I did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot">a second version that targets
Textual</a>. This time it did a
better job and was the catalyst for building
<a href="https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>. This version was
intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example
application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible
version mentioned above, I still wasn't 100% happy with the way it worked.</p>
<p>Recently I did some maintenance work on <code>textual-canvas</code>, cleaning up the
repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python
projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at
<code>textual-mandelbrot</code> and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn't really
sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not
that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick
off a fresh stand-alone application.</p>
<p><a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/">Complexitty</a> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Complexitty on startup" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty.png"></p>
<p>Right now the application has all the same features as the <code>mandelexp</code>
application that came with <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>, plus a couple more. Also
it's built on top of <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced">the common core
library</a> I've been putting
together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on
<a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ATODO%20label%3AEnhancement">I'll add more
features</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed in with Complexitty" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-red.png"></p>
<p>As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with
comprehensive help for commands and key bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-help.png"></p>
<p>and there's also a command palette that helps you discover (and run)
commands and their keyboard bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-commands.png"></p>
<p>Complexitty is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty">via

      <div><p>It pretty much all started with this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> <span class="k">*</span> Revision 1.1  1996/02/15 18:57:13  davep
 <span class="k">*</span> Initial revision
</code></pre></div>

<p>That's from the rcs log <a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng/blob/master/w3ng.c">for the source for
<code>w3ng</code></a>, a tool I wrote so
I could read Norton Guide files in my web browser, served by Apache, running
on my GNU/Linux server in my office. The tool itself was written as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a> tool (remember
them?).</p>
<p>I believe I posted about this to <code>comp.lang.clipper</code> and pretty quickly some
folk asked if it might be possible to do a version that would write the
whole guide as a collection of HTML files for static hosting, rather than
serving them from a cgi-bin utility. That seemed like a sensible idea and
so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> <span class="k">*</span> Revision 1.1  1996/03/16 09:49:00  davep
 <span class="k">*</span> Initial revision
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html/blob/master/ng2html.c"><code>ng2html</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>Fast forward around a quarter of a century and I decided it would be fun to
write <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/">a library for Python that reads Norton Guide
files</a>, and a tool called <code>ng2web</code> was the
first test I wrote of it, designed as a more flexible replacement for
<code>ng2html</code>. I've tweaked and tinkered with the tool since I first created it,
but never actually "finished" it.</p>
<p>That's changed today. I've just released v1.0.0 of <code>ng2web</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="A page generated with ng2web" src="/attachments/2025/03/24/ng2web.png"></p>
<p>If turning one or more Norton Guide files into static websites seems like
the sort of thing you want to be doing, <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ng2web/">take a look at the
documentation</a>.</p>
<p><code>ng2web</code> is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web">via

      <div><p>I've <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/releases/tag/v0.3.0">just released AgiNG
v0.3.0</a>. The main focus
of this release was to get some searching added to the application. Similar
to what I added to <a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">WEG</a> back in the day, I
wanted three types of searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current entry search.</li>
<li>Current guide-wide search.</li>
<li>All registered guides-wide search.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current entry search is done with a simple modal input, and for now the
searching is always case-insensitive (I was going to add a switch for this
but it sort of felt unnecessary and I liked how clean the input is).</p>
<p><img alt="Entry search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search.png"></p>
<p>The search is started by pressing <kbd>/</kbd>, and if a hit is found
<kbd>n</kbd> will take you through all subsequent matches.</p>
<p>As always, if you're not sure of the keys, you'll find them in the help
screen or via the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="Looking up search in the command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/entry-search-palette.png"></p>
<p>Guide-wide and all-guide searching is done in the same dialog. To search
guide-wide you enter what you want to find and untick <em>"All Guides"</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Setting up a guide search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-setup.png"></p>
<p>With that, the search will stick to the current guide.</p>
<p><img alt="Guide-wide search running" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-running.png"></p>
<p>As will be obvious, searching all guides that have been registered with
AgiNG is as simple as ticking <em>"All Guides"</em>. Then when you search it'll
take a walk through every entry of every guide you've added to the guide
directory in the application.</p>
<p><img alt="Gide-wide searching" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/guide-wide-search.gif#centre"></p>
<p>Global searching is accessed with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> or via the
command palette.</p>
<p><img alt="Finding global search" src="/attachments/2025/03/22/global-palette.png"></p>
<p>With this added, I think that's most of the major functionality I wanted for
AgiNG. I imagine there's a few more tweaks I'll think of (for example: I
think adding regex search to the global search screen could be handy), but I
don't think there's any more big features it needs.</p>
<p>AgiNG can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/">from
PyPi</a>. It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>aging</code>:</p>

<p>It seems I really do still have this need to create new terminal-based
projects at the moment. There's been
<a href="/2025/01/03/braindrop.html">Braindrop</a>, then
<a href="/2025/01/25/peplum.html">Peplum</a>, then after that came
<a href="/2025/02/14/hike.html">Hike</a>. While I'm still tweaking and adding to them,
and also using them to refine <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced">a wee library I'm building up that forms the
core of my latest apps</a>, I felt I
still had this one app that I <em>needed</em> to finally build.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s I've had this mild obsession with <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">building tools for
maintaining access to Norton Guide
files</a>. I've written readers for
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg">GNU/Linux (which also works on macOS too)</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2">OS/2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el">GNU
Emacs</a>, and also or the web (in multiple
incarnations). Those builds have covered a few languages, including C, C++,
Pascal, JavaScript and Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>I'd never written a Python library or application for it though.</p>
<p>So when I first saw Textual mentioned in passing on Twitter a few years
back, way back in the 0.1 days, I thought that could be the thing that would
push me over the edge. In anticipation of that, back in 2021, I initially
developed <a href="https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/"><code>ngdb.py</code></a>. This is a library
that provides the core Norton Guide reading code for Python applications and
could form the basis for other tools.</p>
<p>As a test for this I then wrote <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web"><code>ng2web</code></a>
(which works, but I think still needs a bit of tidying up -- something I'm
aiming to do in the next few weeks).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the journey with Textual itself <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">kicked
off</a>, happened, and <a href="/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">came to an
end</a>; and yet somehow I'd never got
round to building the thing I'd initially looked at Textual for: a
terminal-based Norton Guide reader that looked nice and modern (by terminal
standards). When I initially joined Textualize the owner had actually said
they wanted me to build this as test of the framework, to essentially start
out by employing me to create some Free Software that would help dogfood the
library, but that seemed to get forgotten.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of this month and I finally felt it was time to
tackle this. The result is <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging">AgiNG</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-dark.png"></p>
<p>As of v0.1.0 it has most of the features you'd expect from a usable Norton
Guide reader, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ability to add guide files to an in-application directory.</li>
<li>The ability open and navigate a guide.</li>
<li>Full see-also support, etc.</li>
<li>Full translation of characters as were under MS-DOS into the terminal.</li>
<li>The ability to copy entry text or source to the clipboard.</li>
<li>The ability to copy save entry text or source to a file.</li>
<li>Access to a guide's credits.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AgiNG showing a long entry" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-long-entry.png"></p>
<p>I still need to write some proper documentation for the application, but
meanwhile all commands and key shortcuts can be discovered either via the
help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG help" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-help-screen.png"></p>
<p>or by pulling up the command palette:</p>
<p><img alt="AgiNG command palette" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-command-palette.png"></p>
<p>Hopefully the workings of the application will be fairly obvious to anyone
who is familiar with Norton Guide files; if anything isn't making sense <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/q-a">I'm
more than happy to answer
questions</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/davep/aging/discussions/categories/ideas">take suggestions for
improvements</a>.</p>
<p>One wee feature I want to call out, that I felt was important to add, was a
"classic view" facility. The thing with Norton Guide files is they were
mostly created in the very late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s. People would
often get creative with the colouring within them, but in many cases the
colouring assumed the default Norton Guide application. Its colours were
white text on a blue background. So sometimes other colouring was done
assuming that background.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this here, with an entry in a guide being viewed
using the default <code>textual-dark</code> theme:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in textual-dark" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/textual-dark.png"></p>
<p>Notice the colouring in the syntax section. This is more obvious if the
application is switched to one of the light themes:</p>
<p><img alt="Entry in solarized-light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/solarized-light.png"></p>
<p>With a nod to this issue in mind, I added the "classic view" for entries
(which is a sticky setting -- turn it on and it stays on until you turn it
off):</p>
<p><img alt="Classic view in action" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/classic-view.png"></p>
<p>A little hard on the eyes, I think, but also filled with nostalgia!</p>
<p>Talking of themes, all the usual application themes are available, here's a
wee selection:</p>
<p><img alt="Nord" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-nord.png">
<img alt="Textual Light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-textual-light.png">
<img alt="Gruvbox" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-gruvbox.png">
<img alt="Solarize Light" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-solarized-light.png">
<img alt="Monokai" src="/attachments/2025/03/12/aging-monokai.png"></p>
<p>AgiNG is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/aging">via
GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aging/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that has
<code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>aging
</code></pre></div>

<p>It can also be installed with
<code>Homebrew</code> by tapping <code>davep/homebrew</code> and then installing <code>aging</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>aging
</code></pre></div>

<p>Expect to see more updates in the near future; as with other recent projects
this is very much something I'm going to be dabbling with and improving as
time goes on.</p>

      <div><p>Following on from <a href="/2025/02/28/documenting-fspicker.html">my post this
morning</a>, regarding the problem I was
having with <code>_mkdocstrings.css</code> being 404 any time I deployed by
documentation, build with <code>mkdocs</code>/<code>mkdocstrings</code>, to GitHub Pages...</p>
<p>It's come to light that I was doing this on hard mode, pretty much.</p>
<p>While trying to figure out the best way of deploying the docs, I'd stumbled
on <code>ghp-import</code> and had been using that. On the other hand, MkDocs has it's
own command for doing the same thing: <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/"><code>mkdocs
gh-deploy</code></a>.</p>
<p>Timothée <a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742#discussioncomment-12351028">pointed out to
me</a>
that he never runs into this problem, but he used this command. As it turns
out, if you use <code>mkdocs gh-deploy</code> it creates the <code>.nojekyll</code> file by
default.</p>
<p>And how does it do this? It uses the <code>ghp-import</code> code <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/4c7404485f988f409ccaf42fefe705222ff5965a/mkdocs/commands/gh_deploy.py#L138">and uses a switch it
has to achieve exactly
this</a>.
In fact... the command line version even has a switch for it!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-n, --no-jekyll      Include a .nojekyll file in the branch.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is off by default, when you run the command itself, but I wish I'd
noticed this when I was first experimenting. O_o</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to Timothée's pointers, I've now managed to <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/pull/39/files">simplify how I
build and publish the docs from
<code>textual-fspicker</code></a>,
and I'll apply this to other projects too.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've just made a wee update to
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a>, my dialog
library for <a href="https://textual.textualize.io">Textual</a> which adds <code>FileOpen</code>,
<code>FileSave</code> and <code>SelectDirectory</code> dialogs. There's no substantial change to
the workings of the library itself, but I have added something it's been
lacking for a long time: documentation!</p>
<p>Well... that's not quite true, it's always had documentation. I'm an avid
writer of Python docstrings and I make a point of always writing them for
every class, function, method or global value as I write the code. As such
the low-level "API" documentation has always been sat there ready to be
published somehow, eventually.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the description for how to use the library was mostly a pointer to
some example code inside the README. Not ideal, and something I really
wanted to improve at some point.</p>
<p>Given I'm still on a bit of a coding spree in my spare time, I finally
decided to get round to using the amazing
<a href="https://mkdocstrings.github.io">mkdocstrings</a>, in conjunction with
<a href="https://www.mkdocs.org">mkdocs</a>, to <a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/">get some better documentation up an
running</a>.</p>
<p>The approach I decided to take with the documentation was to <a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/using/">have a page
that gave some general information on how to use the
library</a> and then also
<a href="https://blog.davep.org/textual-fspicker/library-contents/base_dialog/">generate low-level documentation for the all the useful content of the
library from the
docstrings</a>.
While latter isn't really useful to anyone wanting to use the library in
their own applications, it could be useful to anyone wanting to understand
how it hangs together at a lower-level, perhaps because they want to
contribute to or extend the library in some way.</p>
<p>While writing some of the general guide took a bit of work, of course, the
work to get the documentation up and running and generating was simple
enough. The effort comes down to 3 rules in the
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/blob/ad6818c96816f2f1ad7a39909d276271af3f760d/Makefile"><code>Makefile</code></a>
for the project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">##############################################################################</span>

<span class="nf">.PHONY</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">docs</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rtfm</code> target is useful for locally-serving the documentation so I can
live preview as I write things and update the code. The <code>publishdocs</code> target
is used to create and push a <code>gh-pages</code> branch for the repository, resulting
in the documentation being hosted by GitHub.</p>
<h2>A wee problem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOTE: <a href="/2025/02/28/mkdocs-gh-pages-redux.html">I've since found out there's an easier way of fixing the issue</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, however, where I ran into a wee problem. I noticed that the
locally-hosted version of the documentation looked great, but the version
hosted on GitHub Pages was... not so great. I was seeing a load of text
alignment issues, and also whole bits of text just not appearing at all.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what I was seeing locally:</p>
<p><img alt="Good layout" src="/attachments/2025/02/28/good.png"></p>
<p>and here's what I was seeing being served up from GitHub Pages:</p>
<p><img alt="Bad layout" src="/attachments/2025/02/28/bad.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, in the "bad" version the <code>func</code> label is missing from the
header, and the <code>Parameters</code> and <code>Returns</code> tables look quite messy.</p>
<p>I spent a little bit of time digging and, looking in Safari's console, I
then noticed that I was getting a 404 on a file called <code>_mkdocstrings.css</code>
in the <code>assets</code> folder. Problem found!</p>
<p>Only... was it though? If I looked in the <code>gh-pages</code> local branch the file
was there (and with fine permissions). If I looked in the remote branch, it
was there too. Thinking it could be some odd browser problem I even tried to
grab the file back from the command line and it came back 404 as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Testing from the command line" src="/attachments/2025/02/28/http-grab.png"></p>
<p>At this point it was getting kind of late so I decided I must have screwed
up somehow but I should leave it for the evening and head to bed. Before
doing so though <a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742">I decided to drop a question into the mkdocstrings
discussions to see if anyone could see where I'd messed
up</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it looked like I hadn't messed up and the reply from the
<a href="https://github.com/pawamoy">always super-helpful Timothée</a> was, in effect,
<em>"yeah, that should work fine"</em>. At least I wasn't the only one confused.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this morning and, with breakfast and coffee inside me, I
decided to try and methodically get to the bottom of it. I <a href="https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/discussions/742#discussioncomment-12348912">wrote up the
current state of
understanding</a>
and looked at what might be the common cause. The thing that stood out to me
was that this was a file that started with an underscore, so I did a quick
search for <em>"github pages underscore"</em> and right away landed on <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2022/11/08/how-to-use-underscores-with-github-pages/">this
result</a>.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>That had to be it!</p>
<p>A little bit of testing later and sure enough, the documentation hosted on
GitHub Pages looked exactly like the locally-hosted version.</p>
<p>So, TIL: by default sites hosted by GitHub Pages will pretend that any asset
that starts with an underscore doesn't exist, unless you have a <code>.nojekyll</code>
in the root of the repository, on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch (or whatever branch
you decide to serve from).</p>
<p>To make this all work I added <code>.nojekyll</code> to
<a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker/tree/ad6818c96816f2f1ad7a39909d276271af3f760d/docs/source"><code>docs/source</code></a>
and added this to <code>mkdocs.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">exclude_docs</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">|</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="no">!.nojekyll</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All done!</p>
<p>And now I've worked out a simple workflow for using <code>mkdocs</code>/<code>mkdocstrings</code>
for my own Python projects, in conjunction with GitHub Pages, I guess I'll
start to sprinkle it over other projects too.</p></div>
