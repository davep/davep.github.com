  <div>
      <div><p>When <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108996">desktop widgets</a> first turned
up in macOS I was pretty quick to embrace them. On my personal Mac Mini I
use a pair of screens, the right one mostly given over to Emacs, and there
was generally room to space there. These days that screen generally looks
something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The usual layout of my right screen" src="/attachments/2024/04/17/right-screen.png#centre"></p>
<p>Recently I've got into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davep-codes/streams">streaming while I do some
coding</a> and it's the
right-hand screen that I work on and capture using OBS. When I was setting
this up I realised that the widgets being there could be a problem; not
because they could distract or anything, more that they could, at times,
contain sensitive information (there's my reminder list and my calendar
there after all).</p>
<p>What I needed was a quick method of hiding all the widgets, and showing them
again later, without it being a lot of faff.</p>
<p>With a little bit of digging around on the net I finally came up with a pair
of <code>fish</code> abbreviations that do just the job!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr -g widoff &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StandardHideWidgets -int 1&quot;
abbr -g widon &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StandardHideWidgets -int 0&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, when I'm going to stream, part of my "getting stuff ready to go live"
checklist is to run <code>widoff</code> in the terminal; once I'm finished I can then
just run <code>widon</code> again to have them come back.</p>
<p>Fast, clean, handy.</p>
<p>I've also got a pair for when I'm using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl534ba392/mac">Stage
Manager</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>abbr -g smwidoff &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StageManagerHideWidgets -int 1&quot;
abbr -g smwidon &quot;defaults write com.apple.WindowManager StageManagerHideWidgets -int 0&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Although, really, I can't remember the last time I used Stage Manager. I
dabbled with it for a wee while, found it vaguely handy in a couple of
situations, but it doesn't seem to have stuck as part of my workflow or work
environment.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Back in 2021, I think it was, when Value first announced the Steam Deck, I
was all <em>"hell yes sign me up!"</em>; like... really, I signed up there and then
to go on the waiting list. The idea of a wee device that would let me play a
ton of games in my Steam library seemed like a great idea. The price seemed
right too.</p>
<p>So, I signed up, and waited, and waited, and life moved on.</p>
<p>When I finally (I think it was the best part of 18 months later?) got the
email saying my Deck was up for grabs and did I want to complete the
purchase I... said nah. By this point I was <em>so</em> heavily into VR gaming that
mucking with stuff on a Deck didn't seem to make much sense to me any more.</p>
<p>I moved on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks back they announced the OLED version and I took a second
look. There was now over a year of reviews to read, hacks to notice, fun to
follow; now I could get an idea if a Deck was any good and if it was for me.
So after a bit of review-reading and review-watching, Thursday last week, I
slapped down an order; and by Tuesday the Deck turned up.</p>
<p><img alt="New Deck getting going" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/new-deck.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The overturning of my original decision to <em>not</em> buy came down to a couple
of things. The first was: I recognised that there were a lot of games in my
library, sometimes things I'd bought (often in a sale), sometimes things I'd
got as part of a Humble Bundle, that just never got played. This, I noticed,
was sort of down to an unfortunate relationship I'd developed with gaming.</p>
<p>See... VR has won me over. I <em>love</em> gaming in VR. Also, I love recording my
gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">throwing them on
YouTube</a>. This means that, to some
extent, in my head, there's <em>effort</em> to getting going with playing a game:
I've got to power up the Windows PC; I've got to let it update stuff; I've
got to let Steam update stuff; I've got to power up the VR headset; I've got
to get it to connect to the PC (which generally works fine but on occasion
needs a complete restart of everything); I need to decide what I'm playing
next and what to record; I've got to get the recording software going; I've
got to...</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Also, of course, I've got to be in the right state to be okay with having a
computer strapped to my face (sometimes you don't feel 100% and being lost
in a virtual world isn't the best thing to be doing).</p>
<p>This can feel like too much effort. It also means that gaming tends to be
left for when I've got a few hours to dedicate to it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But I also <em>love</em> playing games.</p>
<p>My thinking then was a Deck would be a great way of "forcing" myself to play
the more casual stuff. There's no easy (that I know of) way to record or
stream from the Deck; it's also easy to have it on the sofa and turn it on
in a moment. This felt like the ideal device to have to hand, that was
dedicated to gaming, and which would encourage me to take smaller gaming
sessions when the time arises.</p>
<p>Like... sometimes I'll put something on to cook, come into the living room,
pick up the tablet and scroll through the Internet. While I try not to
doom-scroll too much, I can see that it would be more healthy to pick up the
Deck and play DooM!</p>
<p>So far, two days in, I'm convinced this was an excellent idea and I'm
totally won over.</p>
<p><img alt="My Steam Deck and Stream Deck" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/IMG_3842.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I'm still getting a feel for what does and doesn't work best on the Deck,
from a <em>"my taste in games"</em> point of view, but things that allow for
dipping in and having a quick blast are winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/741510/The_Hong_Kong_Massacre/">Hong Kong Massacre</a>
has finally got a play, despite me owning it ever since I saw John Wick 4.</p>
<p><img alt="Hong Kong Massacre" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/hong-kong.jpg#centre"></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">DooM II</a> got installed
and is working well -- I may have to slowly play my way through the whole
thing. I've also installed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255070/Abyss_Odyssey/">Abyss
Odyssey</a> and so
far am finding it quite charming and fun (it's an example of a game that
isn't really my kind of thing; but I got it in a Humble Bundle, I think, and
it's been sat there with 0 hours for way too long).</p>
<p>I've also failed to resist one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/434050/Duke_Nukem_3D_20th_Anniversary_World_Tour/">more questionable titles from my
younger days</a>...</p>
<p><img alt="Come get some" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/duke.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The real surprise for me though has been a game I bought on a whim a couple
of weeks back, which was going cheap, looked fun, seemed nice and casual and
which I installed on the PC and totally ignored (because, again, turning on
the PC to have a quick game seems like a lot of faff):
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/">Brotato</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Brotato" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/brotato.jpg"></p>
<p>This game is frantic, way over the top, kinda confusing in parts (for me)
but accessible enough that I can actually have a ton of fun with it; and
what's really important is that I can pick up the Deck, turn it on, play a
game of this for 10 minutes and then go on to do the thing I needed to do
next. It's the <em>perfect</em> game to play while waiting for the next step in
dinner to cook.</p>
<p>So, yeah, The Steam Deck... I'm won over; I'm so won over. And I haven't
even properly explored the fact that it has a full GNU/Linux desktop inside
it that I can use as a desktop machine...</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Some of this is also true with gaming on the PS5; while it's easier to
turn on and get going, and while I don't have a VR setup for it, I do
have it in my head that it's more for "epic gaming" than quick casual
stuff; see <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/">Death Stranding</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU">Cyberpunk

      <div><p>My journey into the Apple ecosystem has been gradual but all-consuming. I've
gone from, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">around a 8 years
ago</a>, being
unconvinced about how good the whole Apple world is, to pretty much having
all the hardware they make available, in some form, that I have an actual
use for<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the devices I was late to, but won over by, after moving away from
Android to iPhone, was the Apple Watch. These days I have two: the original
SE, and also a Series 8. Generally I've marvelled at just how seamless the
experience is. I swap watches: the connection to my phone "just works" and
it figures all that out. Stuff syncs. Stuff stays in sync.</p>
<p>I lean heavily on the watch. The Series 8 is my daily driver, and the SE
acts as my nighttime tracking device while the 8 charges and I sleep.</p>
<p>I record walks. I record runs. I record lots of heart rate data. I pay for
things, pretty much everything, with it. I... take it for granted really.</p>
<p><img alt="My main watch face" src="/attachments/2023/12/08/watch-face.png#centre"></p>
<p>Yesterday though, something odd started to happen. I noticed that some
things didn't seem to be syncing from my watch to the phone. Health-related
things weren't turning up. A recorded workout didn't show. The control of
all things audio seemed to decouple and the watch kept taking over use of my
AirPods from the phone in an annoying way I'd never experienced before.
Things like that.</p>
<p>I tried a reboot of the watch. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again. I tried a reboot of the phone. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again.</p>
<p>I then rebooted watch and phone, stuff seemed fine, and I didn't think much
more about it.</p>
<p>Then this morning I swapped from the SE back to the Series 8 as I sat down
for breakfast, my usual routine, and the syncing was failing <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>This, for me, this is when Apple stuff gets really frustrating. There's no
easy or obvious way to diagnose what's going on. Like: I could not sync some
health data from the watch to the phone, but I <em>could</em> use "Find My" to ping
the watch (presumably a difference in communication route, BT vs Wi-Fi
perhaps). There's no obvious error dialog. There's no obvious log to look
at. There's no "your BT is borked" alert or something.</p>
<p>Searching online the advice seemed to be the nuclear option: unpair the
watch, reset it, start again. So I've done that this morning and it's been
quite the pain. Getting it set up again was straightforward enough, but
having to go through the whole thing of dismissing all the <em>"here's some
tips on how to use this watch you've had for a year and used every day"</em>
cards was annoying, also having to set up my payment cards again was
annoying. Also, and this is on me for not backing them up recently, trying
to recreate my watch faces from memory and remembering which ones they were
based on was also annoying.</p>
<p>Apple are actually so good at a lot of this seamless shit; but damn do I
wish they'd also be good at making a tool that lets you easily and smoothly
diagnose some issues. I would imagine sync issues between watch and phone
are common enough that a wee tool where you run through diagnostics, and
where there's a Q&amp;A to help narrow down the issue, would be a great
experience.</p>
<p>Anyway... it seems to be up and running again, so hopefully that's that
issue solved. I tried a couple of things that would need to sync from the
watch to the phone and they showed up instantly; actually faster than I've
been used to for quite a while.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed...</p>

the when of it happening, but over the last week or so I've found that every
couple of days Siri seems to lose their voice. By this I mean the high
quality voice that's used when they speak seems to disappear. I notice this
when I ask my phone or headphones a question or to do something, and I get a
really low-quality voice that speaks back to me.</p>
<p>The voice itself seems to be a version of the voice I normally use, but like
it's using an on-device much-cut-down version. If I go into the settings to
check what voice is selected, it's the one I normally use, but it wants to
download it again.</p>
<p><img alt="Downloading the voice all over again" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/siri-voice-loss.png"></p>
<p>Sure enough, once the download is complete all is good again. I've not kept
track of when it happens -- and I think I should from now on -- but it feels
like it happens every couple of days; I almost always notice it first thing
in the morning, the first time I ask the phone or the headphones something.</p>
<p>I hope it is some sort of iOS 17 weirdness and is gone when 17.1 turns up.</p></div>

      <div><p>I have a LinkedIn profile more by accident than on purpose. For most of that
site's early days I just ignored it, even needing to go to the trouble of
aggressively marking emails from it as spam as it seemed to want to turn
itself into some sort of online networking cult, encouraging folk to send
invites to their contacts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn#Use_of_e-mail_accounts_of_members_for_spam_sending">or
worse</a>.
But after job-seeking in late 2017 the recruiter who found me the position I
took up asked if I might join up and endorse him or some such nonsense and,
at the time, I thought what the hell.</p>
<p>Since then though I've mostly found it useless, and at times straight up
horrific. Don't even get me started on how a previous employer's push to
make everyone use their profiles as more company branding created a perfect
pool for people to go phishing in, while at the same time IT were on a
phishing-awareness push; a perfect illustration of how some people lose
their minds when it comes to that site.</p>
<p>The last year though, while working in a more FOSSy world, I've started to
dip my toe back in when it comes to linking to what we're building with
Textual. As such, I drop into the app once or twice a week and look to see
what other folk might be talking about too.</p>
<p>During a recent dip in I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="A suggestion from LinkedIn" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-suggestion.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Huh! Okay! That... that's actually kind of sensible! While I'm nowhere near
looking for anything else to do, showing off the public projects you care
about seems like a good idea. GitHub repos can be a good CV, I believe.</p>
<p>So I click through...</p>
<p><img alt="The project add form" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-add.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>And that's where it all falls apart. Pretty typical for LinkedIn I'd say.
Name, description, obsession with skills, obsession with building up a
social graph. But...</p>
<p>No link to the repo.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Link.</p>
<p>To.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Repo. O_o</p>

<p>I can't even.</p></div>

      <div><p>For as long as I've had a smartphone -- so ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> was released -- I've used
whatever search tool Google have had available as my way of searching for
stuff from my phone. Even when I made the switch to the iPhone, back when
the iPhone 11 was around, I still installed and used the Google Search app.</p>
<p>Since jumping ship from Android to iPhone, I've followed the usual track
that some do of "embracing the ecosystem", and it generally has paid off.
The more I lean into "the Apple way", the more stuff actually does work
together and work together well (I won't say "it just works", because that
can sometimes so <em>very</em> not be true, but really I do find that Apple's
ecosystem is more coherent and more stable than the one Google provided).
But searching for stuff... that stuck with the Google search app.</p>
<p>So, more as an experiment than anything else, starting this morning I've
removed the Google search app from the home screens of my iPhone and my iPad
and I'm going to force myself to use Spotlight to do all my searching, and
see how I get on with it.</p>
<p><img alt="Searching with Apple" src="/attachments/2023/10/14/apple-search.png#centre"></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to searching for stuff on the web, it's not going
to make a whole heap of difference; it's sill going to end up searching with
Google, but I do like the idea of search leaning into what Spotlight knows
about my stuff too.</p>
<p>Also, on my phone at least, it has the added benefit of freeing up a slot in
the dock at the bottom of the home screen.</p></div>

      <div><p>As someone who started out in the Android ecosystem when it came to smart
phones -- starting out with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> and going through a few
different phones before settling on Pixels (until I finally jumped ship to
iOS in 2020) -- I have to admit that there's always been something nice
about the design of iPhones. iOS, less so... My first exposure to iOS was
<a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">back in 2015 when I got an iPod</a>,
and I wasn't terribly impressed. It looked okay, but it felt so far behind
Android in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>Much has changed and improved since then. These days, 3 years into being
totally consumed by the Apple ecosystem (one day I should write a post about
how comprehensively I've moved over), I'm won over and I like how iOS works
now.</p>
<p>Except this...</p>
<p><img alt="Bad design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-bad.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>That thing where, when you're in one app, it will show the most useless link
"back" to another app, and in doing so bump the time up and out of the way a
little. Like, seriously, compare it to when the app link thing isn't there:</p>
<p><img alt="Good design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-good.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Once you see it, you can't unsee it.</p>
<p><img alt="Toggle of the two images" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/bad-good-toggle.gif#centre"></p>
<p>After all this time you'd think they would have found a less janky way of
doing this; perhaps even simply removed it (I can't remember the last time I
needed or wanted the ability to go "back" an app like this, especially not
with the bottom-of-screen swipe gesture being a thing). If nothing else
you'd think that, by now, they'd have found a way of doing it that doesn't
look so terrible.</p>
<p>The <em>"eh, let's just shove it here"</em> approach that seems to be on display
here almost reminds me of <a href="/2015/10/07/imac-time-wiggle.html">the "time wiggle" that used to mildly annoy me
back on my iMac</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p><a href="/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html#home-pod-stuck-installing">A couple of weeks
back</a>
I mentioned home my main HomePod had got stuck installing 16.6 of the
software that runs it. This situation persisted for days after writing that
post and I kept promising myself that I was going to see if I could unstick
it by removing it from the Home, doing a factory reset and adding it back
again.</p>
<p>Of course, during the week that followed, I never got round to that. You can
imagine what it's like: no time in the morning, and by the time I get home
in the evening I want to watch TV and use the HomePod as the speaker for the
Apple TV, I don't want to be doing tech support shit.</p>
<p>The following weekend... yeah, I kinda forgot.</p>
<p>So, here I am, a couple of Saturdays on, it's early morning, I've had
breakfast and I'm having coffee and I think it's the perfect time to do
this. I hope the Home app my on iPad and... it's sorted!</p>
<p><img alt="HomePod all good again" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 07.25.44.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, yeah, it looks like it somehow managed to unstick itself in the end. A
quick test of some of the issues I was seeing suggested there was still an
issue, for example asking for the temperature in the bedroom would still
result in a <em>"working on it"</em> reply followed by it telling me it wasn't
responding. A quick reset seems to have fixed that.</p>
<p>I guess it's good to know: if it happens again, it'll keep on working as the
speaker for my Apple TV, and it'll eventually sort itself out even if I
don't muck about with a hard reset.</p></div>

      <div><p>Following on from <a href="/2023/08/08/strange-obsidian-sync-issue.html">the previous
entry</a>, where I outlined a
weird problem I'd started having with syncing Obsidian via iCloud, I finally
decided to sit down and try and work out the exact flow of the problem.
Today, for example, I'd created an entry in two different vaults on my phone
while on the bus into work, and when I got to my desk the vault I use on my
work machine had updated.</p>
<p>However, when I got home this evening, the vault for my personal stuff
hadn't updated on my home Mac Mini. I tried a few edits, in both vaults, on
the iPhone, and nothing came through to the Mac.</p>
<p>So... before I started really diving into things I decided to <em>"turn it off
and on again"</em> -- the iPhone that is -- and when it came back I ran up
Obsidian, which told me it wasn't allowed to access my iCloud drive!</p>
<p>I took a moment to go into the settings to try and figure it out, didn't
find what I wanted right away, then got to thinking that perhaps some of the
phone's services were still spinning up, so I ran Obsidian up again (after
killing it).</p>
<p>Sure enough, this time, it saw my vaults. With both vaults open on my Mac I
made edits to open entries and <strong>the edits started to flow</strong>.</p>
<p>So, yup, looks like it was a simple case of <em>"turn it off and on again"</em>.</p>
<p>Apple: <code>#ItJustWorks</code>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Since October last year I've been getting into using
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Not that heavily, not to the extent some
people do, but just as a way to keep a daily journal of work-related things.
Each day at <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textual HQ</a>
<a href="https://www.textualize.io/about-us/">we</a> finish off with a chat about how
our day has gone, stuff we're wondering about, etc, etc... So I don't lose
tack of what I've been up to I keep notes and Obsidian is how I do that.</p>
<p>One of the things I really like about it is how I can have iPhone, iPad and
macOS versions on the go and have it all sync via iCloud. It generally works
well.</p>
<p>But in the last couple of days I've noted the oddest problem, and I've yet
to pin down the exact flow. But it seems to be this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I create or edit a note on my iPhone, it doesn't turn up on my Mac.</li>
<li>If I create or edit a note on my Mac, it turns up on my iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>think</em> I might have seen variations on that theme but I've not made
careful note -- normally I'm made aware of it when I'm trying to get
something done.</p>
<p>What's super weird is this: on the iPhone, if I create a note, and then go
into the <code>Files</code> app and look at the iCloud folders for Obsidian, the file
isn't there! It's there in Obsidian itself, I can move it about, edit it,
etc, etc... but it's not in the "vault" as seen from the <code>Files</code> app.</p>
<p>It's the last part that has be really puzzled.</p>
<p>If I get to the bottom of this I'll try and remember to write up what I
find. I suspect I'm going to need some proper clear time, without other
distractions, and experiment with all the edit and sync options and see what
works and what fails.</p></div>
