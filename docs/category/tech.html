      <div><p>A couple of days back (for vague values of "couple", of course), first of
the month, having my morning coffee, I go and open my bank's mobile app to
move a bit of money about and pay a couple of things. This happens every
month. This is so routine I do it almost on autopilot.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know, it's banking, pay attention! But still... morning,
coffee, routine.</p>
<p>I get to the final movement/payment and then notice something:</p>
<p><img alt="Useless error message" src="/attachments/2022/06/03/Unexpected-error.jpeg"></p>
<p>That.... that text! WTF? So then I look back at my payment history and
notice that all but one payment <em>hadn't</em> gone through! O_o</p>
<p>This alone is fine. Stuff happens. Things fail. I'm okay with that. It's an
inconvenience for sure but doubtless whatever the problem is will be fixed
and I can make the payments again later. But...</p>
<p>That result. There's a tick. A <strong>GREEN</strong> tick. And a "Thank you". It's
natural to see that image, know that it's always meant "shit worked" and
just carry on.</p>
<p>In one of my systems at work there's a tool I wrote for checking a
repository of code to make sure it conforms to a certain standard. When folk
use it they get a night big, bold and bright green thumb-up above the text
that says everything is cool. If there's a problem, any sort of problem at
all, then the display is red and there's no jolly icon and it's obvious that
things are different and you likely want to pay attention to the explanation
of what isn't right.</p>
<p>This isn't news, of course. This isn't some revelation about UI design or
anything. We know this stuff. I think what boggles my mind a little bit
about this is that something as important -- and hopefully by this point as
mature -- as a mobile banking app should get something as obvious as this
right.</p>
<p>But here we are, with a nice friendly green icon showing a tick and a
friendly big "Thank you" followed by smaller text going "aye shit didn't
work pal".</p></div>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For well over a year now I've been recording my VR gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg">and uploading
it to YouTube</a>. Less as a "content
creation" thing, more as a nice record of games I've played and, on
occasion, as a little bit of help to others; in the past I've watched other
folk play games I like to get ideas for approaches to them, and I've also
received the odd comment now and again where my play-through has helped
someone else.</p>
<p>A question I've had a couple of times is what I use to do the recording, so
I thought I'd make an effort to write it all down here.</p>
<p>First up, a couple of things to note: I started recording PCVR around April
2021 and the initial setup was a bit trial-and-error and Google searching
and blog reading. As such, not all of the details of <em>how</em> to set up will be
here, and I may even miss off some stuff I changed and is worthy of note; at
the same time I might mention stuff that's just an obvious default.</p>
<p>Consider this blog post as being a written version of one of my videos: it's
for my own fun and benefit and might also help me in the future should I
want to apply some of this again, and if it helps someone else that's a
lovely bonus.</p>
<h1>The Hardware</h1>
<p>While it's not exactly the point of this post, I guess it's worth mentioning
the hardware I use as of the time of writing. Given this is about PCVR, I of
course have a PC which is running Windows. The machine information within
Windows says it's a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warning: I don't do hardware. I buy it from time to time, but hardware
leaves me bored. It runs VR on a PC. This is fine.</p>
<p>The machine itself has 16 GB of memory, is running Windows 10 Home and has a
GeForce RTX 3060 for handling the graphics.</p>
<p>The headset I'm using is a~~n Oculus~~ Meta Quest 2. I've had this
since around November 2020, playing Quest-native games for the first few
months, until I cracked and got the PC mentioned here to get into PCVR.</p>
<p>The headset is connected to the PC with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08MJDNV4F/">a USB
cable</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, for recording voice, I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08T1S7NRP/?th=1">USB lapel microphone with a really
long cable</a>.</p>
<p>It should be said that, yes, sometimes, I do get a little caught up in
things with two cables hanging off me. If I could give one tip here it would
be that running the microphone cable up your trousers and shirt makes life a
ton easier. As a bonus I have the USB cable for the headset running around
the headset's strap and connected to it at the back and then running down my
back.</p>
<h1>OBS Studio</h1>
<p>The core software used is <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>. This has
got to be one of the best bits of free software I've ever used, in terms of
interface and what it delivers.</p>
<p>Years back my son used to record and upload gameplay to YouTube and I can
remember him having no end of issues using different recording software;
some working with one game but not another, some other working with a
different set of games, video and sync issues, etc... Lots of pain quite
often. With OBS Studio the only issues I've ever had have been my own
mistakes.</p>
<p>At this point I have to confess that when I set it up I didn't make a point
of keeping a recording of what I changed -- I was experimenting and not
expecting much to come of it. So what I note here are the things that feel
like they're important, and only the things that relate to recording PCVR,
not streaming it (that might end up being a different blog post).</p>
<p>That said, here are things I seem to remember as being key:</p>
<h2>Output Settings</h2>
<p>The items in the output pane in settings that I have and which might be
important are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Output Mode:</code> Simple</li>
<li><code>Recording Quality</code>: High Quality, Medium File Size</li>
<li><code>Recording format</code>: mkv</li>
<li><code>Encoder</code>: Hardware (NVENC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do remember the recording format being set to <code>mkv</code> as something that's
really important. I think it's <code>mp4</code> by default, or was when I first
installed, and if your machine crashes or OBS were to crash or something,
you could end up with footage that can't be used. Using <code>mkv</code> means you can
still use the footage (as I understand it). It does mean that once you're
finished you have to use the "remux" option under the <code>File</code> menu, but
that's a small price to pay.</p>
<p>I can say that at least once I've had to hard-reboot my machine when a game
and SteamVR and the like all got upset. I likely saved 45 minutes or more of
footage thanks to <code>mkv</code>.</p>
<h1>Video Settings</h1>
<p>Nothing really special in here, I simply have both the base and output
resolutions set to the desktop resolution. This <em>might</em> be something for me
to tinker with in the future, but so far I've not run into any problems.</p>
<h1>VR Capture</h1>
<p>Now, of course, all of the above is great and fine and all but there's the
issue of how you capture the VR gameplay. I approach this a couple of
different ways. The first is I use the <a href="https://github.com/baffler/OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin">OpenVR Capture plugin for
OBS</a>. This makes
capturing footage from SteamVR really easy. The only downside I found is
that out of the box there's no default crop setting for using a Quest 2 (or
I guess the Rift, as the Quest 2 sort of appears as a Rift to SteamVR
games). As such I remember playing trial and error with that until I was
happy I was getting as much footage as possible without having black bars
and the like.</p>
<p>Something I also like about the OpenVR Capture plugin is you can say if you
want to capture the left or right eye. Normally not that big a deal for some
things, but if you're playing a shooter and want people to see exactly what
your dominant eye is seeing, that matters.</p>
<p>Sadly, of course, not every game can be captured with that plugin. So far
I've found that any game that can't be has its own mirror window on the
desktop. In that case I use a <code>Game Capture</code> source and set it to capture
that specific window. I could of course just get it to capture the focused
window or something like that but I prefer to know that it's only grabbing
what I want it to grab.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>That's pretty much it I think. There's not a lot to it, although on occasion
a lot can go wrong. Mostly it's a wonder any of it works. I mean, think
about it, I have a computer with two screens strapped to my face, with two
controllers in my hands talking to it; it's then connected via the Oculus
Link to the Oculus Home; from which I start up SteamVR; and from the SteamVR
home I start up the game and then "live" inside the game. It's a virtual
world inside a virtual world inside a virtual world inside a real world;
with lots of software along the way, all talking at once.</p>
<p>That is then being recorded.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on occasion, it takes a reboot or five to make it all work
together.</p>
<p>Really, it's a wonder it ever works. ;-)</p></div>

    </p>

  <div>
      <div><p><em>I'm filing this as a TIL because, while it wasn't T, I did L it very
recently and it was a new trick that impacted on around 25 years if prior
working practice.</em></p>
<p>I think it must have been around 1991 when I first encountered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS">4DOS</a>. While I'd used the odd Unix
shell here and there previously, it'd only been in passing. It was 4DOS that
first introduced me to the power of aliases on the command line. Many of the
aliases I set up and used in 4DOS still remain with me to this day, on
GNU/Linux and macOS, in some form or another.</p>
<p>I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone reading this why aliases and cool and
handy and pretty much vital if you do lots of work on the command line.</p>
<p>And then, a couple or so weeks ago, as a very recent convert to
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>, I discovered the
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#abbr"><code>abbr</code></a> command. At
first glance it didn't seem to make much sense. It was like
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#alias"><code>alias</code></a>, only it
expanded what you typed rather than acted as a command in its own right.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging and some of it started to make sense. One thing that
really won me over -- and while it's something that doesn't directly impact
on me -- was the argument that it allows for a far more transparent command
history; especially if you're likely to use a transcript of a shell session
in a place where people might not know or have access to your aliases.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a position where you have loads of handy and cool aliases,
but you also need to record what you've done so other people can follow your
work (does it show that I sit amongst people who maintain lab notebooks?);
it seems like it would be a bit of a bother needing to record all of the
aliases in your own work environment up front. Without that information few
people will be able to make sense of the recorded commands, with that
information they'd still need to double-check what each command does.</p>
<p>So imagine an alias that, when used, expands in place. Then you'd get all of
the benefit of aliases while also having a full and readable record of what
you <em>actually</em> did.</p>
<p>Seems neat!</p>
<p>Here's a silly example. For a long time I've carried around an alias called
<code>greedy</code> that runs something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's pretty straightforward: I'm using <code>du</code> to get a sense of which
directories are using what space, and then using <code>sort</code> to make a
worst-to-best-offender list out of it. So I could use an alias:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">greedy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;du -hs * | sort -rh&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The only downside to this is that, any time I run it, if I were to record
the shell session and make it available for someone else to read, they'd
just see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>greedy
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, with an abbreviation rather than an alias, I'd type <code>greedy</code> but as
soon as I hit <code>Enter</code> it'd get expanded to something anyone could read and
follow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/develop$<span class="w"> </span>du<span class="w"> </span>-hs<span class="w"> </span>*<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sort<span class="w"> </span>-rh
<span class="m">1</span>.1G<span class="w">    </span>JavaScript
824M<span class="w">    </span>C
699M<span class="w">    </span>rust
<span class="w"> </span>93M<span class="w">    </span>python
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>fonts
<span class="w"> </span>33M<span class="w">    </span>elisp
<span class="m">3</span>.4M<span class="w">    </span>zsh
<span class="m">3</span>.0M<span class="w">    </span>misc
<span class="m">1</span>.1M<span class="w">    </span>bash
840K<span class="w">    </span>ocaml
428K<span class="w">    </span>C++
316K<span class="w">    </span>lisp
172K<span class="w">    </span>Swift
152K<span class="w">    </span>git
132K<span class="w">    </span>ruby
<span class="w"> </span>28K<span class="w">    </span>ObjC
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is far from the only benefit of abbreviations; for most people it
probably isn't one of the most important ones, but I find it neat and
compelling and this alone drove me to rework almost all of my aliases as
abbreviations.</p>
<p>Having done that, I get other benefits too. For example, fish (like other
shells) has good support for argument completion for well-known commands.
The problem is, if you alias such a command, you don't get that completion.
With an abbreviation though you do! All you need to do is type the
abbreviation, hit <code>space</code> and it'll expand to the underlying command and
then the full range of completion can happen.</p>
<p>There's also one last reason why I like abbreviations over aliases, and it's
kind of a silly one, but in a good way. It's actually fun to see what you
type magically expand as you do things, it makes you look like you can type
even faster than you normally can! ;-)</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>I want to like Gboard. On paper it looks really rather good. It's a keyboard
from Google, it ties in with your account, it syncs things, it has clever
searching for emoji and gifs and the like... what's not to like?</p>
<p>Problem is, I've been a user of SwiftKey since around 2011 (I think it was).
I'm very used to how SwiftKey works and it also contains a lot of handy
things. I like that it has smart completion, that it learns how I type a bit
skewed and that it takes this into account, that I can turn off the fancy
swipe typing and instead make use of handy gestures like swipe-left to
delete a word. I like some of the themes a lot.</p>
<p>Into the mix comes my iPad, which I use on occasion. The standard Apple
keyboard is horrible and, sadly, I find SwiftKey on iOS just as frustrating.
It seems to lack enough key features there (especially the word deletion
gesture, as far as I can tell) that it's also a bit annoying. My dream of a
consistent typing experience across all devices just wasn't happening --
until I found Gboard on iOS.</p>
<p>That felt almost right. And from what I could tell it worked almost exactly
the same on iOS and Android. So it felt like a good time to try and force
myself to use Gboard on my Google Pixel and Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I'm just not getting on with it. It's okay. It's not bad.
It's just... not good. I'm finding that it lacks enough useful things that
it's a frustrating experience. Little things like: when I enter Google
Search, there's no word completion in the keyboard (SwiftKey has that); the
word deletion gesture (swipe left from the backspace key) seems very
hit-and-miss; the most obvious completion for a word sometimes appears in
the middle slot but, other times, in the left slot. And so on.</p>
<p>Nothing huge. Nothing that's a show-stopper. But a handful of a little
things that make me miss the comfortable home that is SwiftKey.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it does have some very handy and cleaver features too.
The searching for emoji -- including showing them up as word completions --
is rather clever. The gif-search thing is all kinds of fun too (mostly used
to annoy the hell out
of <a href="https://twitter.com/VolcanicArts">my son on twitter</a>).</p>
<p>None of those quite make up for the bits I miss from SwiftKey though.</p>
<p>All that said, I've being making a point of pushing on with Gboard, thinking
that most of my issues might just be because I'm too used to my "old home".
Mostly this was working well, until I noticed something this morning. While
reading the description for Gboard I noticed this handy thing in the "Pro
Tips" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sync your learned words across devices to improve suggestions (enable in
Gboard Settings→ Dictionary → Sync learned words).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful! I'd assumed that this was the case anyway -- it's Google after all
-- but it's good to know I can ensure it's turned on. So I went to turn it
on. This is what I found:</p>
<p><img alt="Gboard WTF" src="/attachments/2017/03/13/Screenshot_20170313-072359.png"></p>
<p>What the hell Google? Sure, I do have a Gsuite account on my phone -- as in
various apps have access to a Gsuite account (Gmail, Drive, etc...) -- but
it's not the primary account on my phone and it's not the account I'd really
want to be doing the dictionary sync with anyway. If I've got dictionary
sync I want it tied to the keyboard no matter the app I'm in, and no matter
the account I'm using in that app. I want the keyboard to be tied to a
specific account when it comes to sync (just like SwiftKey does it).</p>
<p>This, I think, is a show-stopper for me.</p>
<p>I can overlook the other niggles, I can learn to cope with it not being
quite so perfect in some situations; but the blanket inability to do
something as simple as cloud-sync the predictions and learn from how I type
-- things that are, these days, central to what Google's about -- it's
frankly stupid.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going to have to keep Gboard as a backup keyboard for those
times when I need to find the perfect gif.</p>

      <div><p>Over the past couple or so weeks I've been having some issues with Google
Now. It first seemed to start on my Nexus 7, then appeared on my Nexus 6.
More recently, even as of today, I've seen it on
my <a href="/2017/03/08/hello_google_pixel.html">Google Pixel</a>. The problem is that,
in the Google Now launcher (or on the Pixel, in the Pixel launcher), the
Google Now page (that you swipe to the left for) sits empty for ages. All I
see is the little animated waiting circle and nothing else. Once or twice
I've had the Google app die and restart or, more often than not, after quite
some time it finally loads up.</p>
<p>The latter happened a little earlier and I noticed something I'd not seen
before:</p>
<p><img alt="Blank Google Now" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-115910.jpg"></p>
<p>What's with that "Achievements" menu option? You'll notice that the whole of
the menu is blank -- no profile picture or anything and none of the menu
options seemed to work.</p>
<p>Eventually, after I'd left it for a while, it ended up working.</p>
<p><img alt="Google Now finally working" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-120052.jpg"></p>
<p>And, once this happened, no "Achievements" option.</p>
<p>Presumably this is some back-end server issue, I'm being served up something
I'm not supposed to be seeing and it's confusing the client app. Okay, I
don't <em>know</em> that's the case, but it has that sort of feel.</p>
<p>So now I need to go looking for what this Achievements thing is all about.</p>
<p>Using Google, obviously.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>For the past two years I've, mostly, being happily using a Google Nexus 6 as
my phone. In the past six months or so I've started to notice that it hasn't
been quite as good as it was. The main problem, for me, was that the camera
was starting to play out. The issues were the ones that I've seen reported
elsewhere: use of the camera would quickly make the phone laggy, very slow
response times on pressing the shutter, occasional failure to save an image,
etc. This was generally frustrating and, even more so, because <a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html">I'd got back
into photoblogging</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I've been lusting over the Google Pixel ever since it was
originally shown off. I was some way off my phone contract renewal and the
price of a new Pixel was something I just couldn't justify. Last week though
an offer cropped up that meant I could renew early <em>and</em> get a Pixel
(including a free Daydream headset thrown in).</p>
<p>Fast forward to Monday just gone and...</p>
<p><img alt="My new Pixel" src="/attachments/2017/03/08/IMG_20170308_120458.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm liking it rather a lot. It is odd that it's smaller in my hand
than the Nexus 6 was (the XL wasn't an available option <em>and</em> I was also
starting to think it was time to drop down in size a little again) but I'm
also finding it a little easier to work with; it's also nice that it fits in
trouser pockets as well as jacket pockets.</p>
<p>It feels very fast (although every Android phone and tablet I've ever had
have felt fast to start with) and smooth to use. I especially like the
default feedback vibration -- it's a lot smoother yet also more reassuring
than any I've felt before.</p>
<p>The Google Assistant is proving to be very handy. I'm sort of used to it
anyway thanks to having owned an Android Wear watch for a couple of years
but having it on the phone like this seems like a natural next step.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm getting very used to very quickly, and really liking a
lot, is fingerprint recognition. I didn't think I needed it but now I'm
wondering how I ever managed without it. Combined with the notification
pull-down gesture that the recognition area supports it seems like a perfect
way to open the get going with a phone.</p>
<p>There's a couple of niggles with it, of course. The main one for me is the
lack of wireless charging. That was something I really liked about the Nexus
6: I could be sat at my desk and have the phone sat on top of a charging
pad, staying topped up. No such handy setup with the Pixel. The other thing
is the lack of water resistance. To be fair: it's not something I've ever
really felt I <em>needed</em> with other phones and I'm not in the habit of
sticking them under water; but knowing that it doesn't matter too much if it
gets exposed to rain would be nice.</p>
<p>Other than that... there's not much else to say right now. It works and
works well, the move from the N6 to it was pretty smooth and the Pixel has
fallen perfectly into my normal routine.</p></div>

      <div><p>Over the past couple or so
weeks <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">my Macbook air</a> has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"></p>
<p>Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.</p>
<p>So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.</p>
<p>I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.</p>
<p>I joined the queue.</p>
<p>About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.</p>
<p>By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p>So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.</p>
<p>Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>The other day I stumbled on a tip about Evernote. It
was
<a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/10/28/one-student-made-productivity-habit/">a snippet of information in a bigger post on the Evernote blog</a>
so I saved it to Evernote (obviously) to take a look at later.</p>
<p>The tip was that Ctrl-Cmd-B in Evernote (on the Mac) will format a body of
text as source code. While I'm not in the habit of using Evernote to store
code, not even snippets of code (that's something far better served
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>), it seemed like something worth
committing to memory.</p>
<p>This morning, while finally in front of a suitable machine, I took a look.
Sure enough, there's the menu option.</p>
<p><img alt="Code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.36.42.png"></p>
<p>Handy! So I created a test note with some code in it so that I could see how
it formatted it. I was curious to see if it just did simple fixed text or if
it offered options to highlight various languages (I didn't hold out much
hope for the latter, but it was worth a look).</p>
<p>That's when it got odd.</p>
<p>After I created a note and went to format some code, the menu option
disappeared!</p>
<p><img alt="Lack of code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.37.07.png"></p>
<p>From what I can tell, once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. At
least, not until you actually close down Evernote and start it up again.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, none of this is the case in the Windows version. While the
key combination is different there, the menu option is available and stays
available.</p>
<p>The version of Evernote I have (on my iMac and my Macbook) is 6.9.2. The
version number on Windows is 6.4.2 (after checking for updates -- I'm going
to guess that the Mac and Windows version numbers don't match on purpose).</p>
<p>Goodness knows what's going on here. All I can imagine is that it has
something to do
with
<a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/97731-code-block-in-evernote-for-mac/">a thread I found on Evernote's support forum</a> that
suggests that code block formatting is some sort of test/beta feature and
can only be enabled via a settings option that <em>isn't</em> available via the
version downloaded from the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>So, at some point, I guess I'm going to have to uninstall Evernote from the
Macbook and the iMac, reinstall from the Evernote website itself, and try
this again. All of which seems a bit silly when <em>the menu option is there
and visible when I run Evernote up!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> Sure enough, removing the App Store version and installing
the version from Evernote's own website, and <em>then</em> going into preferences
and enabling the option, sorted it. It's still really odd they'd promote the
facility via the blog and not mention it, and also very odd that the option
would always show until the first time you're in a position to use it, and
then it'd disappear.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.</p>
<p>Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).</p>
<p>I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.</p>
<p>So I had to go and look.</p>
<p>Having looked I came away with one.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.</p>
<p>As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.</p>
<p>For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.</p>
<p>And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.</p></div>

      <div><p>Now and again Google seem to actually listen. While they do generally have a
bad habit of removing things from things and saying it's for everyone's good
(because options are bad and they can't maintain them, apparently) it seems
they <em>can</em> do the odd turnaround now and again.</p>
<p>One thing they removed from Android recently was the
"<a href="/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html">until next alarm</a>""
option when putting a device in "do not disturb" mode.</p>
<p>Seems they've added that back in 6.0.1:</p>

<p>It's a small thing, but it makes so much more sense and makes things so much
