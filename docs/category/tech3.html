  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>As much as I like my iMac, and as much as I am generally impressed with OS X
the more I use it, I'm constantly frustrated by the little issues I run into
that make life so much more interesting and which fly in the face of the
"it just works with Apple" fandom thing. The more I use the iMac, the more I
appreciate that Macs and OS X are just as "fun" as anything running Windows.</p>
<p>A little earlier was a good example. I wanted to share part of the iMac's
filesystem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">SMB</a>.
This seemed easy enough, the instructions on how to do it were clear and,
after following them, it utterly failed.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>So I Googled the issue a bit and ran into
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6629743?start=0&amp;tstart=0">this handy forum post</a>.
Apparently you can't actually connect with SMB if the account you're going to
be using to connect with is using iCloud login rather than a separate login.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Not an obvious thing. Nothing said this was the case. According to the forum
post even Apple couldn't help the person who'd been trying to make it work.
But at least there was a workaround. All I'd need to do is split the password,
have a login for the machine that <em>wasn't</em> the iCloud login and I'd be all good.</p>
<p>I did it, it worked. I could browse the iMac's filesystem from my Windows
machine and all was good (I'd been able to do this the other way around
for ages and with no problems whatsoever).</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to allow SMB for me" src="/attachments/2015/10/21/Screen Shot 2015-10-21 at 15.29.11.png"></p>
<p>Then I got curious.</p>
<p>What would happen if, once I had this set up, I "unsplit" the password and
went back to using the iCloud password to log in? That's when it got really fun.</p>
<p>To do this it asks you for the current password and also your iCloud password.
I entered both and...</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to allow SMB for me" src="/attachments/2015/10/21/Screen Shot 2015-10-21 at 15.28.46.png"></p>
<p>Yup. It refuses, every single time, to accept that the iCloud password I'm
entering is valid. Trust me, it is. I'm entering the correct password. I can
log in to the iCloud website with it just fine. But when I use it to try and
"unsplit" my password.... nope.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've even tried disabling SMB sharing for my account, and even turning off
SMB sharing altogether. This doesn't seem to make any difference. Right now,
as far as I can see, now that I've split the password I can't go back
despite the fact that there's a method of doing it made available.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p></div>

      <div><p>I have too many Microsoft accounts. Far too many. And they still confuse
the hell out of me.</p>
<p><img alt="Too many MS logins" src="/attachments/2015/10/19/Screen Shot 2015-10-19 at 12.05.30.png"></p>
<p>I found out over the weekend that the office was closing down the old internal
email server. Everything moving to Office365. I use Gmail for my email (I have
a freebie Google Apps account that I use as the front end for it -- when it
comes to things like email I'm Gmail all the way). So, as of today, I have
a new work-oriented Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Problem is, I already had a work-oriented Microsoft account because that's how
I use MSDN and download stuff from that.</p>
<p>I also have a personal outlook.com account for reasons I can't remember now.</p>
<p>And then there's the Windows gaming login, which might or might not be related
the the one above.</p>
<p>And then there's the old Xbox live account that I think has nothing to do with
the above.</p>
<p>And then...</p>
<p>The problem I have is that I never seem to be able to log in with an existing
MS account any time something new crops up, and so I somehow seem to end up
having to make a new one. And now I have too many and there's no obvious way
to merge them or kill them off without losing some service I don't even know
I need to use any more.</p>
<p>And then there's my two Skype accounts (personal and work)...</p>
<p>Make it stop! Please! And give me a merge facility!</p></div>

      <div><p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a creature of habit. Once I get used to
something I find it hard to change. In many areas of my life there has to be
really compelling reasons to change something. I've found that this is the
case with my Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>When I first got it it took me a couple or so days to find a face that I was
happy with and, in the end, I went with <a href="http://www.pujiewear.com/">Pujie Black</a>,
along with a colour scheme I set up myself (called <em>RGB</em>, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p><img alt="Pujie Black with RGB face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Pujie Black.png"></p>
<p>Today though I stumbled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.marscity.sunlight&amp;hl=en_GB">Krona Sunlight</a>.
This face really got my interest. Part of the reason is that, while what I'm
wearing is normally called a "watch", I don't see it as a watch (just like
my phone isn't really a phone). It's a wearable Android device that gives me
handy info at a glance and lets me set reminders and things without even
having to reach for my phone, tablet, Chromebook or desktop machine.</p>
<p>This face fits perfectly into that.</p>
<p><img alt="Krona Sunlight face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Krona Sunlight.png"></p>
<p>While it lacks the battery information (edit to add: it doesn't lack battery
information, it's just an option that is off by default), and second time display, that Pujie
Black has, it more than makes up for it with the rather fantastic display
of weather and sunrise/set information -- especially how it displays temperature.</p>
<p>This was enough to not only have me buy a copy, but also to switch to it. I'm
going to be sticking with it for the next couple of days to see how I feel
about it and see if I miss any of the other information.</p>
<p>This might be a little bit of change I can cope with.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Almost a week ago (yes, I have being meaning to write something down about
this and have kept failing to do so) my iMac told me that there was a new
version of the OS waiting for me. While this is doubtless no big deal for
most Mac owners, this was interesting to me because it's the first time
I've experienced an OSX upgrade since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I got the iMac</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="El Capitan downloading" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.01.37.png"></p>
<p>The download took a while and, while the install had a couple of curious
bumps along the way, nothing seemed to actually go wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="About to get going" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.18.png"></p>
<p>The two main things I noticed were that it seemed to take the installer an
absolute age to close down all running apps before it got to doing the
installation. The other was that Mac progress bars seem to have a very odd
way of calculating things. Often it would tell me that there was (for example)
28 minutes to go, it'd stay like that for 20 minutes, then drop 5 minutes,
then appear to finish very soon after.</p>
<p><img alt="The final countdown" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Mostly though I just left it alone and let it do its own thing. While the whole
process took quite a while, it came back just fine (if I'm fair I'm not sure
it took much more time than when I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to
Windows 10).</p>
<p>The changes and improvements aren't really that obvious. I think I would say
that the machine feels a little quicker in places, but nothing I can really
put my finger on. One of the things I do like is the new split-screen facility
for full-screen apps. While I don't use the full-screen facility <em>that</em> much
I have found the need to split the screen before.</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements I've read about seem to involve things I'm
never going to use: either improvements to Safari (Chrome all the way for
me), the Mac Mail app (Gmail all the way for me, with <a href="http://www.kiwiforgmail.com/">Kiwi for Gmail</a>
being my client of choice on the iMac) or various iOS-oriented things which
are of little use (while <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I do own an iOS device</a> it's not one I use much).</p>
<p>Overall the thing I'm taking away from this is that the upgrade was smooth,
nothing was obviously broken or changed in a way that was confusing (unlike
some Windows or ChromeOS updates I've experienced in the past) and I didn't
have to do anything that required much in the way of knowledge to keep it
all going.</p>
<p>Doubtless that won't always be the case, such is the nature of OS upgrades.</p></div>

      <div><p>While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">my iMac</a>.</p>
<p>One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:</p>
<p><img alt="Support details of the iMac" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.14.png"></p>
<p>Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.23.png"></p>
<p>Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o</p>
<p>I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.30.55.png"></p>
<p>About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.</p>
<p>So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.</p></div>

      <div><p>I seem to have somehow messed up my left hand. I'm not sure what the problem is
yet, I'm speaking to the doctor and have had an x-ray to check out one possible
cause, but the simple fact is that my left hand has an issue. Sometimes the
arm is painful, pretty much all the time a couple of fingers are near-numb.
One unfortunate side-effect of this is that I'm finding typing rather
uncomfortable. Except, that is, when I'm typing in my
<a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">iMac</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the vast majority of the typing I do is on my Windows 7 desktop
machine I decided it was time to look at getting a new keyboard, one that
was as comfortable to type on as the Apple keyboard. Given that I really needed
to be in a position where I could actually try the keyboards out I headed
off to the local PC World.</p>
<p>Long story short: none of the Windows-oriented keyboards I tried did it for me.
None were as comfortable as the Mac keyboard. I tried a few a couple of times
and then suddenly had an idea... Apple do a full-size keyboard and, from what
I've seen in the past, it does work with Windows, after a fashion. So I went
to talk to the Apple guy, checked they had one in stock, handed over £40 and
headed home again.</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Keyboard" src="/attachments/2015/08/17/Apple-Keyboard.jpg"></p>
<p>Having now worked with it for a couple of days I think this might be one of
the best keyboard purchases I've ever made.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, of course. The keyboard isn't designed to work with Windows,
it's designed for the Mac. But for the most part I'm finding that it's not
confusing and I'm adapting just fine.</p>
<p>I had to go searching for an unofficial layout that I could install (one
that's actually old enough that it doesn't even say it supports Windows 7)
and installing that seems to have cured a few issues. The issues I do have
remaining are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the application I'm in, @ and " are swapped. Really, I'm not
kidding. In SublimeText @ and " are the right way round; in Skype they're the
wrong way round. I suspect that this might be down to the fact that I need
to restart applications so they take up the new mapping (a reboot of the machine
might be in order here).</li>
<li>The keyboard has no marked insert toggle key. There is one, it's the 0 on
the numeric keyboard if you have (also missing, but with a mapping) numlock
turned off.</li>
<li>Alt and Win are the wrong way round. The Cmd key acts as the Win key and it
is in the same position as Alt is normally in. I'm actually adapting to this
pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Apple hates the # key. Much like I have problems typing # on the iMac, the
same issue exists when typing on Windows too. Whereas on the iMac I have to
use Alt-3 to get a #, on the Windows machine I have to use Ctrl-Alt-3. Not
ideal but it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>They're the main issues I've discovered so far. It's possible that there are
other niggles waiting for me but, hopefully, there's workarounds for them too.
Mostly though I'm finding that the small adjustments I have to make to how I
work are worth it given just how comfortable this keyboard is to type on.</p>
<p>I really do wish there was a Windows-oriented keyboard that had the exact same
build quality.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've never really liked Facebook. I forget exactly when I ended up on there --
perhaps 2009 or so -- but I can remember exactly who to blame. It was all the
fault of <a href="http://richd.me/">Rich Daley</a>. On an atheism-oriented BB that has
long since fallen off the net he convinced me that it was "<em>X</em> for adults"
(where <em>X</em> was a popular early social network whose name totally escapes me
now) and I fell for it.</p>
<p>And I hated it.</p>
<p>But I stuck with it.</p>
<p>I stuck with it until September 2011. I realised that after
a few years of using it I still found the site confusing, ugly, unfriendly
(in terms of design) and somewhat invasive too. On top of that I'd made the
common mistake of allowing anyone I'd ever run unto on the net add me there
and so the contact list was huge and out of control -- I didn't really know
who most of the people were. So <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/jPqNPhg7idp">I deleted the account</a>.</p>
<p>Back then there was, as I recall, no explicit delete option, or to do the
delete thing you had to deactive and wait 14 days, or some such thing. I know
that I followed the advice in the docs and did whatever was required to have my
account totally deleted.</p>
<p>This week, at the urging of friends, I finally decided to create an account
again. I initially tried to create the account using the old email address
(well, actually, a variation on it that would appear to be the same to
systems that understand the significance of a + in an email address) but it
told me that the address was in use. Which was a worry.</p>
<p>So I created the account using a different address (my actual "main" address
this time, as opposed to my Google address) and set about setting it up.</p>
<p><img alt="So I'm on Facebook again" src="/attachments/2015/08/13/Screen Shot 2015-08-13 at 08.46.26.png"></p>
<p>In doing so I tried to tell it that I wanted to associate my old address with this
new account and, again, it refused, telling me there was an active account for
that address.</p>
<p>I then went and checked and, sure enough, there was my old account, still
there, all the data, nothing had changed!</p>
<p>Fucking Facebook!</p>
<p>These days, however, it does look like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674">there are very clear instructions on
how to actually fully delete an account</a>, so I've tried again for the old
account. It's another 14 days of deactivation but with an actual promise that,
yes, this time, they'll delete all my shit.</p>
<p>They better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I have a shiny new Facebook account. And I still find it confusing,
ugly, unfriendly (in terms of design) and somewhat invasive.</p></div>
