    <p>For as long as I've had a smartphone -- so ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> was released -- I've used
whatever search tool Google have had available as my way of searching for
stuff from my phone. Even when I made the switch to the iPhone, back when
the iPhone 11 was around, I still installed and used the Google Search app.</p>
<p>Since jumping ship from Android to iPhone, I've followed the usual track
that some do of "embracing the ecosystem", and it generally has paid off.
The more I lean into "the Apple way", the more stuff actually does work
together and work together well (I won't say "it just works", because that
can sometimes so <em>very</em> not be true, but really I do find that Apple's
ecosystem is more coherent and more stable than the one Google provided).
But searching for stuff... that stuck with the Google search app.</p>
<p>So, more as an experiment than anything else, starting this morning I've
removed the Google search app from the home screens of my iPhone and my iPad
and I'm going to force myself to use Spotlight to do all my searching, and
see how I get on with it.</p>
<p><img alt="Searching with Apple" src="/attachments/2023/10/14/apple-search.png#centre"></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to searching for stuff on the web, it's not going
to make a whole heap of difference; it's sill going to end up searching with
Google, but I do like the idea of search leaning into what Spotlight knows
about my stuff too.</p>
<p>Also, on my phone at least, it has the added benefit of freeing up a slot in
the dock at the bottom of the home screen.</p>
