<meta name="description" content="This follows on from my previous post. If you&#39;ve not read that, it&#39;s worth having a dive in first for the background. The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair of scripts. The first one, called selection, did what visual-selection does, only visual-selection does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target phrase. As covered before: I don&#39;t remember all of the details of the conversation that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the lines of &#34;yes, but you start out and end up with something the same length&#34; and &#34;nothing more complex is made&#34; (let&#39;s gloss over the whole &#34;complex&#34; thing for now... well okay let&#39;s just gloss over it, end of story; this is just a fun coding exercise). What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the &#34;fitness landscape&#34; that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a population over and over and see what happens. Would I &#34;randomly&#34; create known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters? So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that aren&#39;t in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival within the landscape). Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun to write some code. This version became selection2. So, having turned selection into a TUI application with Textual, I had to do the same with this code... As before, because it&#39;s fun to do so, this leans heavily on the worker API and textual-plotext. If you want to check out the app itself there&#39;s a GitHub repo and it can also be installed from PyPi using pipx." />

    <p>This follows on from my <a href="/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html">previous post</a>.
If you've not read that, it's worth having a dive in first for the
background.</p>
<p>The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair
of scripts. The first one, called <code>selection</code>, did what <code>visual-selection</code>
does, only <code>visual-selection</code> does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a
random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target
phrase.</p>
<p>As covered before: I don't remember all of the details of the conversation
that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the
lines of <em>"yes, but you start out and end up with something the same
length"</em> and <em>"nothing more complex is made"</em> (let's gloss over the whole
"complex" thing for now... well okay let's just gloss over it, end of story;
this is just a fun coding exercise).</p>
<p>What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about
I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the
"fitness landscape" that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a
population over and over and see what happens. Would I "randomly" create
known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters?</p>
<p>So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would
randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a
random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that
aren't in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival
within the landscape).</p>
<p>Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun
to write some code.</p>
<p>This version became <code>selection2</code>.</p>
<p>So, having turned <code>selection</code> into a TUI application with Textual, I <em>had</em>
to do the same with this code...</p>
<p><img alt="Evolve Words" src="/attachments/2023/10/31/evolve-words.png#centre"></p>
<p>As before, because it's fun to do so, this leans heavily on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a> and
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/evolve-words">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/evolve-words/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p>
