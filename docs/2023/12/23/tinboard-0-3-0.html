<meta name="description" content="It looks like I&#39;m in a wee period of small incremental changes and release of Tinboard. This morning I&#39;ve release v0.3.0, which has a couple of small but useful changes. The first is more of a cosmetic thing. The Footer widget in Textual is handy for showing the current keyboard bindings in a given context, but it can get massively cluttered very quickly (we do have plans to revisit this); in Tinboard this clutter creep was turning into a thing. So I&#39;ve removed almost every binding from being displayed in the Footer, and have placed an emphasis on the user pressing F1 to get context-sensitive help, and have also left the most useful bindings in the footer with very minimal descriptions. Given that this is a keyboard-first application, and I&#39;ve tried to make the bindings easy to remember, I think it&#39;s going to make more sense to do it like this, and will make for a tidier UI too. There is one disadvantage here of course: by removing the display of bindings from the footer, the mouse-heavy user becomes disadvantaged; if a particular binding doesn&#39;t have a UI feature that favours the mouse to cover it too there&#39;s no way to initiate that action with the mouse. I&#39;m going to think on this a little. Again, Tinboard is designed for me first and foremost, and my preference is to be keyboard-first when using the application; but finding a good compromise would be advantageous when it comes to advising people asking about Textual application design. The second change is a simple but useful one. I&#39;ve added a toggle of the sort order of the tags menu in the left-hand column (bound to F4). Right now it simply toggles between alphabetical order, or bookmark count order (most to least). At some point I might make it more of a cycle than a toggle, but this serves my purposes for now. Tinboard can be installed with pip or (ideally) pipx from PyPi. The source is available on GitHub." />

  <div>
    <p>It looks like I'm in a wee period of small incremental changes and release
of <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a>. This morning I've release v0.3.0,
which has a couple of small but useful changes.</p>
<p>The first is more of a cosmetic thing. The <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/footer/"><code>Footer</code> widget in
Textual</a> is handy for showing
the current keyboard bindings in a given context, but it can get massively
cluttered very quickly (we do have plans to revisit this); in Tinboard this
clutter creep was turning into a thing.</p>
<p>So I've removed almost every binding from being displayed in the <code>Footer</code>,
and have placed an emphasis on the user pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> to get
context-sensitive help, and have also left the most useful bindings in the
footer with very minimal descriptions.</p>
<p>Given that this is a keyboard-first application, and I've tried to make the
bindings easy to remember, I think it's going to make more sense to do it
like this, and will make for a tidier UI too.</p>
<p>There is one disadvantage here of course: by removing the display of
bindings from the footer, the mouse-heavy user becomes disadvantaged; if a
particular binding doesn't have a UI feature that favours the mouse to cover
it too there's no way to initiate that action with the mouse. I'm going to
think on this a little. Again, Tinboard is designed for <em>me</em> first and
foremost, and my preference is to be keyboard-first when using the
application; but finding a good compromise would be advantageous when it
comes to advising people asking about Textual application design.</p>
<p>The second change is a simple but useful one. I've added a toggle of the
sort order of the tags menu in the left-hand column (bound to
<kbd>F4</kbd>). Right now it simply toggles between alphabetical order, or
bookmark count order (most to least). At some point I might make it more of
a cycle than a toggle, but this serves my purposes for now.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on
GitHub</a>.</p>
