At the time I was very overweight and wanted to get into some sort of healthy state. By August that year I&#39;d managed to drop 30kg and hit and then went a wee way under my goal. These days I&#39;m back up a wee bit. Not much: generally about 5kg or so above that goal, most of that having turned up on the last 7 or 8 months (not exactly coincidental that it&#39;s happened in conjunction with the new job, the new work location, and the new commute). While it&#39;s no real cause for concern -- I&#39;m still generally careful and still get plenty of exercise (normally walk around 35km a week, run 20km, get my 10k steps in every day) About a week back I decided that it was time to give myself a bit of breathing room, to try and at least drop a couple or kg; so with that in mind I set a lower daily calorie goal in my tacking app. When recording my weight first thing this morning (yes, I&#39;m one of those people who records it every day and have for a few years -- it makes for interesting data!), this is what my calorie/stats tracker had to say: I guess it&#39;s putting a positive spin in things?

    <p>Anyone who was (un)lucky enough to follow me on Twitter back in 2020 will
know that, starting January 1st that year, I set about losing weight. At the
time I was <em>very</em> overweight and wanted to get into some sort of healthy
state. By August that year I'd managed to drop 30kg and hit and then went a
wee way under my goal.</p>
<p>These days I'm back up a wee bit. Not much: generally about 5kg or so above
that goal, most of that having turned up on the last 7 or 8 months (not
exactly coincidental that it's happened in conjunction with the new job, the
new work location, and the new commute). While it's no real cause for
concern -- I'm still generally careful and still get plenty of exercise
(normally walk around 35km a week, run 20km, get my 10k steps in every day)</p>
<p>About a week back I decided that it was time to give myself a bit of
breathing room, to try and at least drop a couple or kg; so with that in
mind I set a lower daily calorie goal in my tacking app.</p>
<p>When recording my weight first thing this morning (yes, I'm one of those
people who records it every day and have for a few years -- it makes for
interesting data!), this is what my calorie/stats tracker had to say:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my calorie and weight tracking app" src="/attachments/2023/07/21/IMG_2475.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I guess it's putting a positive spin in things? (for the record, I'm 5.3kg
<em>above</em> my absolute goal).</p>
