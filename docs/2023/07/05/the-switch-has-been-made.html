<meta name="description" content="Well, it didn&#39;t take as long as I expected it to. Just yesterday morning I was giving Pelican a look over as a possible engine for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I liked it and wondered how long it would take me to make the switch. By the evening I was making a proper effort to get the switchover started, and just a wee while earlier, before writing this post, the switch was made! The process of making the switch was roughly this (and keep in mind I&#39;m coming from using Jekyll): Made a branch in the repo to work in. Removed all of the Jekyll-oriented files. Decided to set up Pelican and related tools in a virtual environment, managed using pipenv. Ran pelican-quickstart to kick things off and give me a framework to start with. Renamed the old _posts directory to content. Kept tweaking the hell out of the Pelican config file until it started to look &#34;just so&#34; (this is a process that has been ongoing, and doubtless will keep happening for some time to come). Tried out a few themes and settled on Flex; while not exactly what I wanted, it was close enough to help keep me motivated (while rolling my own theme from scratch would seem fun, I just know it would mean the work would never get done, or at least finished). Did a mass tidy up of all the tags in all the posts; something I&#39;d never really paid too much attention to as the Jekyll-based blog never actually allowed for following tags. Went though all the posts and removed double quotes from a lot of the titles in the frontmatter (something Jekyll seems to have stripped, but which Pelican doesn&#39;t). Tweaked the FILE_METADATA to ensure that the slugs for the URLs came from the filenames -- by default Pelican seems to slugify the title of a post and this meant that some of the URLs were changing. All in all I probably spent 6 or 7 hours on making the move; a lot of that involving reading up on how to configure Pelican and researching themes. The rest of it was a lot of repetitive work to fix or tidy things. The most important aspect of this was keeping the post URLs the same all the way back to the first post; as best as I can tell I&#39;ve managed that. So far I&#39;m pleased with the result. I&#39;m going to live with the look/theme for a wee while and see how it sits for me. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll tweak it a bit as time goes on, but at the moment I&#39;m comfortable with how it looks." />

    <p>Well, it didn't take as long as I expected it to. Just <a href="/2023/07/04/considering-pelican.html#considering-pelican">yesterday
morning</a> I was
giving <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> a look over as a possible engine
for generating my blog, having wanted to move away from Jekyll for a while
now. Having tried it and liked what I saw to start with, I wrote about how I
