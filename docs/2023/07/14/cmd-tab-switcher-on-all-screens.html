<meta name="description" content="This week, on Monday gone in fact, we moved office. We&#39;ve now got a bigger space and, as part of that, bigger desks. Somewhat (but not entirely) coincidentally the work desk will also convert into a standing desk1. Also also... I inherited a second screen for the desk too. Ever since the days of CRTs and video cards that supported it, I&#39;ve been a fan of having at least a couple of screens in front of me, and now at my work desk I&#39;ve got 3 (two external displays and the display of the MacBook Pro itself). This caused a slight problem though: horizontally there&#39;s quite the spread of things to look at. This is fine, mostly I&#39;m looking at the screen that&#39;s in front of me; the MacBook is to the left and the &#34;second&#34; screen is to the right, both with &#34;other&#34; stuff on them. In front of me is Emacs and my browser, which I flip between lots. The problem is this: the MacBook needs to go to the left (because of physical layout), which means that despite me setting the screen in front of me as the &#34;main&#34; screen, the Cmd-Tab display (you know the thing: when you hit Cmd-Tab you see the icons of all your active applications) appears on the left-most display, which is the MacBook. Not great. If I&#39;m looking at the right-most display, and want to switch using the keyboard, I&#39;ve got to look over to the left, as a worst case. That makes for a lot of unnecessary head-swivelling. One quick Google later and Today I Learnt that the following pretty much solves the problem: $ defaults write com.apple.Dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true $ killall Dock As the name of the setting would suggest: once done, the switcher appears on all displays. That&#39;s perfect. Although the work one is manual hand-cranked, not electronic button-push goodness like my new one at home. ↩" />

  <div>
    <p>This week, on Monday gone in fact, <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">we</a> moved
office. We've now got a bigger space and, as part of that, bigger desks.
Somewhat (but not entirely) coincidentally the work desk will also convert
into a standing desk<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Also also... I inherited a second screen for the
desk too. Ever since the days of CRTs and video cards that supported it,
I've been a fan of having at least a couple of screens in front of me, and
now at my work desk I've got 3 (two external displays and the display of the
MacBook Pro itself).</p>
<p>This caused a slight problem though: horizontally there's quite the spread
of things to look at. This is fine, mostly I'm looking at the screen that's
in front of me; the MacBook is to the left and the "second" screen is to the
right, both with "other" stuff on them. In front of me is Emacs and my
browser, which I flip between lots.</p>
<p>The problem is this: the MacBook needs to go to the left (because of
physical layout), which means that despite me setting the screen in front of
me as the "main" screen, the <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> display (you know
the thing: when you hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> you see the icons of
all your active applications) appears on the left-most display, which is the
MacBook.</p>
<p>Not great. If I'm looking at the right-most display, and want to switch
using the keyboard, I've got to look over to the left, as a worst case. That
makes for a lot of unnecessary head-swivelling.</p>
<p>One quick Google later and <em>Today I Learnt</em> that the following pretty much
solves the problem:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>defaults<span class="w"> </span>write<span class="w"> </span>com.apple.Dock<span class="w"> </span>appswitcher-all-displays<span class="w"> </span>-bool<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">true</span>
$<span class="w"> </span>killall<span class="w"> </span>Dock
</code></pre></div>

<p>As the name of the setting would suggest: once done, the switcher appears on
<em>all</em> displays.</p>
<p>That's perfect.</p>
