<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside form the odd show here and there, I&#39;ve never really done the Fringe. As in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn&#39;t quite allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every year I&#39;ve been up here I&#39;ve managed one show, at least, but this year I want to try and make myself get to a few. Maybe one per week. Possibly. Might not happen, but I&#39;m going to try. What can I say? I don&#39;t live in Edinburgh, I&#39;m not a big &#34;be out amongst people&#34; kind of person, and the activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little part of Scotland is a constant battle. But this year I&#39;m going to try my best. This evening I&#39;ve booked a ticket for an artist I&#39;ve been a fan of since the 1990s: Nick Harper. I saw Nick quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I think 2009 might be the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat (again, life stuff). So seeing that he&#39;s playing here for a few days was something I could not ignore. This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something kinda sociable. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be mad at me most of the day it&#39;s happening, but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he&#39;ll be thankful. Right now, at this moment... I&#39;m rather looking forward to it." />

<p>I've lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside
form the odd show here and there, I've never really <em>done</em> the Fringe. As
in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn't quite
allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every
year I've been up here I've managed one show, at least, but this year I want
to try and make myself get to a few.</p>
<p>Maybe one per week. Possibly.</p>
<p>Might not happen, but I'm going to try. What can I say? I don't live <em>in</em>
Edinburgh, I'm not a big "be out amongst people" kind of person, and the
activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little
part of Scotland is a constant battle.</p>
<p>But this year I'm going to try my best.</p>
<p>This evening I've booked a ticket for an artist I've been a fan of since the
1990s: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harper">Nick Harper</a>. I saw Nick
quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I <em>think</em> 2009 might be
the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat
(again, life stuff). So seeing that <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/5-nights-in-harperspace">he's playing here for a few
days</a> was
something I could not ignore.</p>
<p>This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something
kinda sociable. I'm sure he'll be mad at me most of the day it's happening,
but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he'll be thankful.</p>
<p>Right now, at this moment... I'm rather looking forward to it.</p>
