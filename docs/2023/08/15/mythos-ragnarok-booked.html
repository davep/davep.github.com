    <p>That's a third show booked! This means that, <a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html#off-to-see-nick-harper">as I
hoped</a>, I'm
going to manage at least one show a week for the Fringe!</p>
<p>Now, this one could be seen as a cheat, sorta, kinda. I've seen this show
before. But I liked it so much last year I <em>have</em> to see it again! The odd
thing about it was it's not something I would have gone for on my own, it's
technically not really my thing, but I got talked into it and I'm so glad I
was!</p>
<p>So a year back <a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle">Mariëlle</a> told me about
this wrestling show at the Fringe and how she wanted to go but nobody else
was interested and I was all <em>"yebbut wrestling though?"</em> and didn't think
much more about it. Eventually though, after some persuasion (I mean, an
hour or so at a show and some beers afterwards, how bad could it be
really?), I agreed to go. I expected to find it meh.</p>
<p><img alt="Cast of Mythos: Ragnarok 2022" src="/attachments/2023/08/15/IMG_7612.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Holy shit was it so much fun! Like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37r1CqMKLzM">seriously so much
fun</a>. I'd never realised that
wrestling was the best way to tell the tales from Norse mythology; turns out
that wrestling is absolutely the best way to tell the tales from Norse
mythology.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mythos-ragnarok">we're off back again this
year</a>. All booked,
not this weekend, the weekend after.</p>
<p>There might even be a beer afterwards. Perhaps not <em>quite</em> so many as last
year though.</p>
