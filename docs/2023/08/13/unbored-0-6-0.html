<meta name="description" content="Late on last year I wrote about a bunch of new things that I&#39;d added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an early dog-fooding session we had at textual HQ. Since then I&#39;ve been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to date with Textual. As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework, but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there&#39;s still new ways of doing things being designed so there&#39;s going to be the odd break in approach now and again. Unbored, my kind of silly self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with 0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn&#39;t crashing. The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of containers (they didn&#39;t used to receive focus by default, now they do so I had to tell them not to again), and that was about it. While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the nifty little slide-in error dialog I&#39;d made, and instead embraced the new Textual notification system. While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no real use to anyone, I feel it&#39;s a pretty good barometer application, helping me check what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual. It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested way; for this though it&#39;s less crucial and is a good test of the state of the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it&#39;ll be helpful to me if it does break and they yell." />

    <p><a href="/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html">Late on last year</a> I wrote about a
bunch of new things that I'd added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an
early <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">dog-fooding session we had at textual
HQ</a>.
Since then I've been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to
date with Textual.</p>
<p><img alt="Unbored" src="/attachments/2023/08/13/unbored.png#centre"></p>
<p>As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework,
but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there's still new ways of
doing things being designed so there's going to be the odd break in approach
now and again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/unbored">Unbored</a>, my kind of silly
self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x
for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with
0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple
of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn't crashing.</p>
<p>The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of
containers (they didn't used to receive focus by default, now they do so I
had to tell them not to again), and that was about it.</p>
<p>While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZsXGQQpFw">nifty little slide-in error dialog I'd
made</a>, and instead embraced
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/07/17/textual-0300-adds-desktop-style-notifications/">the new Textual notification
system</a>.</p>
<p>While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no <em>real</em> use to
anyone, I feel it's a pretty good barometer application, helping me check
what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual
application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual
dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested
way; for this though it's less crucial and is a good test of the state of
the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it'll be
helpful to me if it <em>does</em> break and they yell.</p>
