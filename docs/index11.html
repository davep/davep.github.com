  <div>
      <div><p>I woke up this morning to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRobotArm/status/651811143284076544">this</a> being retweeted by a few people I follow:</p>
<p><img alt="An effect of sanctions" src="/attachments/2015/10/08/ToryUK.png"></p>
<p>Even if I was to let my usual net-cynic side take over and decide there's a
good chance it's a made-up story there's no getting away from the fact that
this is a story that isn't in isolation. I hear this sort of thing time and
again; especially from people who have to deal with the fallout from this
first hand.</p>
<p>This is something that is happening, in 2015, in the country I live in.</p>
<p>I wish it wasn't.</p>
<p>This is why I find
<a href="/2015/09/07/labour-said-no-thanks-to-my-support.html">Labour's accusation of lying</a>
so damn annoying and frustrating. For a short while I simply decided that
that was that. They're as corrupt as the rest of them and only in it for the
money. This was made even more clear by how often they kept trumpeting the
new member numbers. It's all about the numbers -- all about the money.</p>
<p>But then I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYNPzJgV8TI">this video</a>:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYNPzJgV8TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>and got to thinking that perhaps, just perhaps, some change for the better
is actually happening inside Labour. Perhaps I should give the organisation
the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps, if I contacted the membership team and
asked <em>why</em> they'd decided I was lying, they'd give me the information and I
could sort things out.</p>
<p>So I did. I wrote to them. I sent this to them, via the form on their
website, on 2015-09-28:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 5th 2015 I received an email from you accusing me of
having lied when I sought to become a supporter, with a view to
applying to be a member after seeing the results of the leadership
election. This was a rather hurtful event and one I wrote about here:
http://blog.davep.org/2015/09/07/labour-said-no-thanks-to-my-support.html</p>
<p>Having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYNPzJgV8TI I find
myself in the odd position of liking the message of a party that, at
the same time, accused me of something without evidence.</p>
<p>Given this I'd like to get to the bottom of what happened, hopefully
find out what evidence was used to make the accusation and, perhaps,
get an apology so that I can seriously consider joining and supporting
what is happening.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, of course, gave all my full details -- the email address I'd used, my home
address, my full name, etc. All the information that I'd given when I signed
up as a supporter. From what I could tell they had everything they needed to
be able to check and give an adequate reply.</p>
<p>It took a while but I finally got a reply. This email came through on
2015-10-06:</p>
<p><img alt="Labour wants another tenner" src="/attachments/2015/10/08/Screen Shot 2015-10-08 at 10.26.19.png"></p>
<p>So that seems pretty clear: a non-answer to my question and they're asking
for another £10 on top of the £3 they already have off me to find out what
evidence they have that meant it was okay for them to take my £3 and then
accuse me of lying.</p>
<p>What's the betting that I'll spend that £10 and get a non-answer?</p>
<p>What's even more infuriating is that I'm not actually asking for information
they have on file about me, I'm asking for clarification for something they've
already told me.</p>
<p>It's really hard not to view this as a simple bait and switch.</p>
<p>So now I'm left wondering what to do next; trying to decide if I just give it
up as a bad job and accept that, really, nothing has changed and they're as
bad as ever. Corbyn might well be talking a good game but, under that cover,
it's still just another money-grabbing organisation that wants power and
very little change.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a creature of habit. Once I get used to
something I find it hard to change. In many areas of my life there has to be
really compelling reasons to change something. I've found that this is the
case with my Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>When I first got it it took me a couple or so days to find a face that I was
happy with and, in the end, I went with <a href="http://www.pujiewear.com/">Pujie Black</a>,
along with a colour scheme I set up myself (called <em>RGB</em>, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p><img alt="Pujie Black with RGB face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Pujie Black.png"></p>
<p>Today though I stumbled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.marscity.sunlight&amp;hl=en_GB">Krona Sunlight</a>.
This face really got my interest. Part of the reason is that, while what I'm
wearing is normally called a "watch", I don't see it as a watch (just like
my phone isn't really a phone). It's a wearable Android device that gives me
handy info at a glance and lets me set reminders and things without even
having to reach for my phone, tablet, Chromebook or desktop machine.</p>
<p>This face fits perfectly into that.</p>
<p><img alt="Krona Sunlight face" src="/attachments/2015/10/07/Krona Sunlight.png"></p>
<p>While it lacks the battery information (edit to add: it doesn't lack battery
information, it's just an option that is off by default), and second time display, that Pujie
Black has, it more than makes up for it with the rather fantastic display
of weather and sunrise/set information -- especially how it displays temperature.</p>
<p>This was enough to not only have me buy a copy, but also to switch to it. I'm
going to be sticking with it for the next couple of days to see how I feel
about it and see if I miss any of the other information.</p>
<p>This might be a little bit of change I can cope with.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Almost a week ago (yes, I have being meaning to write something down about
this and have kept failing to do so) my iMac told me that there was a new
version of the OS waiting for me. While this is doubtless no big deal for
most Mac owners, this was interesting to me because it's the first time
I've experienced an OSX upgrade since <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">I got the iMac</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="El Capitan downloading" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.01.37.png"></p>
<p>The download took a while and, while the install had a couple of curious
bumps along the way, nothing seemed to actually go wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="About to get going" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.18.png"></p>
<p>The two main things I noticed were that it seemed to take the installer an
absolute age to close down all running apps before it got to doing the
installation. The other was that Mac progress bars seem to have a very odd
way of calculating things. Often it would tell me that there was (for example)
28 minutes to go, it'd stay like that for 20 minutes, then drop 5 minutes,
then appear to finish very soon after.</p>
<p><img alt="The final countdown" src="/attachments/2015/10/06/Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 12.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Mostly though I just left it alone and let it do its own thing. While the whole
process took quite a while, it came back just fine (if I'm fair I'm not sure
it took much more time than when I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to
Windows 10).</p>
<p>The changes and improvements aren't really that obvious. I think I would say
that the machine feels a little quicker in places, but nothing I can really
put my finger on. One of the things I do like is the new split-screen facility
for full-screen apps. While I don't use the full-screen facility <em>that</em> much
I have found the need to split the screen before.</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements I've read about seem to involve things I'm
never going to use: either improvements to Safari (Chrome all the way for
me), the Mac Mail app (Gmail all the way for me, with <a href="http://www.kiwiforgmail.com/">Kiwi for Gmail</a>
being my client of choice on the iMac) or various iOS-oriented things which
are of little use (while <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I do own an iOS device</a> it's not one I use much).</p>
<p>Overall the thing I'm taking away from this is that the upgrade was smooth,
nothing was obviously broken or changed in a way that was confusing (unlike
some Windows or ChromeOS updates I've experienced in the past) and I didn't
have to do anything that required much in the way of knowledge to keep it
all going.</p>
<p>Doubtless that won't always be the case, such is the nature of OS upgrades.</p></div>

      <div><p>While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">my iMac</a>.</p>
<p>One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:</p>
<p><img alt="Support details of the iMac" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.14.png"></p>
<p>Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.23.png"></p>
<p>Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o</p>
<p>I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.30.55.png"></p>
<p>About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.</p>
<p>So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.</p></div>

      <div><p>I've never been a member of a political party. Ever. The main reason is I'm not
that much of a "joiner" and I tend to dislike making compromises on subjects
that actually matter. I have been a member of political causes in the past
but even those I've had to leave because of the struggle I felt when it came
to being associated with actions I disagreed with (yes, I am looking at you
<a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/">National Secular Society</a>). While there are
plenty of causes that I support, either in spirit or in actual donations, I
almost never actually join up.</p>
<p>I've also been a fairly flexible supporter of candidates in general elections.
While my politics are very much what you'd call "left" my voting patterns
tend to be related to how suitable I find a candidate from the parties that
I find I have a lot of overlap with in terms of stated aims. Unsurprisingly,
for all of my voting life, this has been a case of selecting from Labour
or LibDem candidates (with the odd look at the Green candidate). When doing so
one of the major factors in making the choice has been tactical voting given
that, for most of my life, I've lived in (what normally appeared to be) Tory
safe seats.</p>
<p>But, for many reasons, I've always felt an important connection to Labour.</p>
<p>Possibly one of the best moments, in political terms, was that night in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997">1997</a>,
as I drove back home, down the M3 from London, listening to the radio, hearing
Tory after Tory fall and realising that, for the first time in my (politically
concious) life, I was going to enjoy the benefits, we were all going to enjoy
the benefits, of a Labour government. This was such a sweet victory after
having really felt the defeat of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>The Blair horror show that followed was.... horrific. I don't think I've ever
felt as let down by an organisation as I did by that Labour government.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this year and I was really hopeful that, perhaps, Labour would
be back in government, and this time, lessons would have been learnt. I wasn't
as enthusiastic as before but I was cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>Sadly, it wasn't to be.</p>
<p>After this happened, and looking around me and seeing where we were now and
where we were heading, I found myself thinking that, perhaps, this time, it
was time to break my "no joining" rule. I started to seriously consider joining
Labour, lending some sort of support, somehow being involved and taking part.</p>
<p>That's when I first noticed the whole business of being able to take part in
the Labour leadership election by being a supporter. This seemed like the
perfect way to dip my toe in, see how I felt about being associated in some
way, get a feel for how things worked and, perhaps, depending on how it all
went, actually join.</p>
<p>So I paid my £3.00 and looked forward to the process that was to follow.</p>
<p>I then waited, and waited, and waited, and then on Saturday this happened:</p>
<p><img alt="I got purged" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/IGotPurged.png"></p>
<p>In other words.... I got <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/labourpurge">purged</a>.</p>
<p>And a couple of events before this have me wondering and a little suspicious
of how this went down.</p>
<p>I'll make clear here though: my application to be a supporter was 100%
genuine. As I say above, this was a first step on a road that I felt might
actually end up with me joining a party -- something I've never done before.
It wasn't something I did lightly. It was something I did after conversations
with a couple of other people where the conversations were about genuine
concern with how our country is shaping up right now.</p>
<p>Even as late as a week before I got the above email I was having a conversation
with my nephew who, I'm deeply proud to say, is a very politically-aware
teenager (far more than I was at his age) and is actually a member of the
Labour Party. The conversation was about how I was starting to trust the party
again and how I was even considering joining depending on how events went.</p>
<p>My application wasn't some joke thing, wasn't done on a whim, wasn't done to
try and skew any result. It was done because it was something I cared about
and wanted to explore further.</p>
<p>Anyway, come late on last week I'd had no sort of ballot email and, prompted
by a couple of emails from a couple of the leadership campaign groups, I
filled in the form to ask them to hurry it up. I think it was late on Thursday
evening (2015-09-03) or early Friday morning (2015-09-04).</p>
<p>A little later on Friday this happened (Anroid twitter):</p>
<p><img alt="A follow from someone involved in Labour" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screenshot_2015-09-07-11-07-16.png"></p>
<p>Same follow as seen from Tweetdeck:</p>
<p><img alt="A follow from someone involved in Labour" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screen Shot 2015-09-07 at 16.17.06.png"></p>
<p>I've no idea who <a href="https://twitter.com/polycarponkundi">@polycarponkundi</a> is
but it seemed clear from their timeline that they are a Labour supporter or
even member and that they are a strong supporter of the Liz Kendall leadership
campaign.</p>
<p>I didn't think too much of the follow; it seemed like an unusual coincidence
that I'd chase up my ballot email and then someone apparently involved in
the party would follow me, but coincidences happen.</p>
<p>Then, the following day, I get the letter telling me to sod off. Suddenly the
coincidence seems less of a coincidence. I go and check the profile and notice
that they've even unfollowed me, just a couple of days after the follow.</p>
<p><img alt="That account no longer follows me" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screen Shot 2015-09-07 at 16.21.45.png"></p>
<p>Note the lack of "follows @davepdotorg" in the profile?</p>
<p>Very odd.</p>
<p>Right now I'm not drawing any firm conclusions about what happened, and I have
<a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/640829279966765056">asked them what the follow and unfollow was all about</a>.
It would be unfair of me to decide the events were connected without asking
first.</p>
<p>All of this though has made something clear to me. Labour have decided that
they never want my support, ever again. I have it in writing. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>What I actually have in writing is an email that says <em>"we're taking and keeping
your £3.00 and we're calling you a liar while we do this. If you want to
prove that you're not a liar you need to actually join us, actually send us
even more money. Oh, and by the way, we're not going to tell you what evidence
we have that you're a liar, so ner."</em></p>
<p>Thank you Labour. At least I know where I stand now. You can safely assume
that you'll never have my support ever again.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I seem to have somehow messed up my left hand. I'm not sure what the problem is
yet, I'm speaking to the doctor and have had an x-ray to check out one possible
cause, but the simple fact is that my left hand has an issue. Sometimes the
arm is painful, pretty much all the time a couple of fingers are near-numb.
One unfortunate side-effect of this is that I'm finding typing rather
uncomfortable. Except, that is, when I'm typing in my
<a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">iMac</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the vast majority of the typing I do is on my Windows 7 desktop
machine I decided it was time to look at getting a new keyboard, one that
was as comfortable to type on as the Apple keyboard. Given that I really needed
to be in a position where I could actually try the keyboards out I headed
off to the local PC World.</p>
<p>Long story short: none of the Windows-oriented keyboards I tried did it for me.
None were as comfortable as the Mac keyboard. I tried a few a couple of times
and then suddenly had an idea... Apple do a full-size keyboard and, from what
I've seen in the past, it does work with Windows, after a fashion. So I went
to talk to the Apple guy, checked they had one in stock, handed over £40 and
headed home again.</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Keyboard" src="/attachments/2015/08/17/Apple-Keyboard.jpg"></p>
<p>Having now worked with it for a couple of days I think this might be one of
the best keyboard purchases I've ever made.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, of course. The keyboard isn't designed to work with Windows,
it's designed for the Mac. But for the most part I'm finding that it's not
confusing and I'm adapting just fine.</p>
<p>I had to go searching for an unofficial layout that I could install (one
that's actually old enough that it doesn't even say it supports Windows 7)
and installing that seems to have cured a few issues. The issues I do have
remaining are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the application I'm in, @ and " are swapped. Really, I'm not
kidding. In SublimeText @ and " are the right way round; in Skype they're the
wrong way round. I suspect that this might be down to the fact that I need
to restart applications so they take up the new mapping (a reboot of the machine
might be in order here).</li>
<li>The keyboard has no marked insert toggle key. There is one, it's the 0 on
the numeric keyboard if you have (also missing, but with a mapping) numlock
turned off.</li>
<li>Alt and Win are the wrong way round. The Cmd key acts as the Win key and it
is in the same position as Alt is normally in. I'm actually adapting to this
pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Apple hates the # key. Much like I have problems typing # on the iMac, the
same issue exists when typing on Windows too. Whereas on the iMac I have to
use Alt-3 to get a #, on the Windows machine I have to use Ctrl-Alt-3. Not
ideal but it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>They're the main issues I've discovered so far. It's possible that there are
other niggles waiting for me but, hopefully, there's workarounds for them too.
Mostly though I'm finding that the small adjustments I have to make to how I
work are worth it given just how comfortable this keyboard is to type on.</p>
<p>I really do wish there was a Windows-oriented keyboard that had the exact same
build quality.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've never really liked Facebook. I forget exactly when I ended up on there --
perhaps 2009 or so -- but I can remember exactly who to blame. It was all the
fault of <a href="http://richd.me/">Rich Daley</a>. On an atheism-oriented BB that has
long since fallen off the net he convinced me that it was "<em>X</em> for adults"
(where <em>X</em> was a popular early social network whose name totally escapes me
now) and I fell for it.</p>
<p>And I hated it.</p>
<p>But I stuck with it.</p>
<p>I stuck with it until September 2011. I realised that after
a few years of using it I still found the site confusing, ugly, unfriendly
(in terms of design) and somewhat invasive too. On top of that I'd made the
common mistake of allowing anyone I'd ever run unto on the net add me there
and so the contact list was huge and out of control -- I didn't really know
who most of the people were. So <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/jPqNPhg7idp">I deleted the account</a>.</p>
<p>Back then there was, as I recall, no explicit delete option, or to do the
delete thing you had to deactive and wait 14 days, or some such thing. I know
that I followed the advice in the docs and did whatever was required to have my
account totally deleted.</p>
<p>This week, at the urging of friends, I finally decided to create an account
again. I initially tried to create the account using the old email address
(well, actually, a variation on it that would appear to be the same to
systems that understand the significance of a + in an email address) but it
told me that the address was in use. Which was a worry.</p>
<p>So I created the account using a different address (my actual "main" address
this time, as opposed to my Google address) and set about setting it up.</p>
<p><img alt="So I'm on Facebook again" src="/attachments/2015/08/13/Screen Shot 2015-08-13 at 08.46.26.png"></p>
<p>In doing so I tried to tell it that I wanted to associate my old address with this
new account and, again, it refused, telling me there was an active account for
that address.</p>
<p>I then went and checked and, sure enough, there was my old account, still
there, all the data, nothing had changed!</p>
<p>Fucking Facebook!</p>
<p>These days, however, it does look like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674">there are very clear instructions on
how to actually fully delete an account</a>, so I've tried again for the old
account. It's another 14 days of deactivation but with an actual promise that,
yes, this time, they'll delete all my shit.</p>
<p>They better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I have a shiny new Facebook account. And I still find it confusing,
ugly, unfriendly (in terms of design) and somewhat invasive.</p></div>
