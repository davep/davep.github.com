  <div>
      <div><p>I've never been a member of a political party. Ever. The main reason is I'm not
that much of a "joiner" and I tend to dislike making compromises on subjects
that actually matter. I have been a member of political causes in the past
but even those I've had to leave because of the struggle I felt when it came
to being associated with actions I disagreed with (yes, I am looking at you
<a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/">National Secular Society</a>). While there are
plenty of causes that I support, either in spirit or in actual donations, I
almost never actually join up.</p>
<p>I've also been a fairly flexible supporter of candidates in general elections.
While my politics are very much what you'd call "left" my voting patterns
tend to be related to how suitable I find a candidate from the parties that
I find I have a lot of overlap with in terms of stated aims. Unsurprisingly,
for all of my voting life, this has been a case of selecting from Labour
or LibDem candidates (with the odd look at the Green candidate). When doing so
one of the major factors in making the choice has been tactical voting given
that, for most of my life, I've lived in (what normally appeared to be) Tory
safe seats.</p>
<p>But, for many reasons, I've always felt an important connection to Labour.</p>
<p>Possibly one of the best moments, in political terms, was that night in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997">1997</a>,
as I drove back home, down the M3 from London, listening to the radio, hearing
Tory after Tory fall and realising that, for the first time in my (politically
concious) life, I was going to enjoy the benefits, we were all going to enjoy
the benefits, of a Labour government. This was such a sweet victory after
having really felt the defeat of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>The Blair horror show that followed was.... horrific. I don't think I've ever
felt as let down by an organisation as I did by that Labour government.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this year and I was really hopeful that, perhaps, Labour would
be back in government, and this time, lessons would have been learnt. I wasn't
as enthusiastic as before but I was cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>Sadly, it wasn't to be.</p>
<p>After this happened, and looking around me and seeing where we were now and
where we were heading, I found myself thinking that, perhaps, this time, it
was time to break my "no joining" rule. I started to seriously consider joining
Labour, lending some sort of support, somehow being involved and taking part.</p>
<p>That's when I first noticed the whole business of being able to take part in
the Labour leadership election by being a supporter. This seemed like the
perfect way to dip my toe in, see how I felt about being associated in some
way, get a feel for how things worked and, perhaps, depending on how it all
went, actually join.</p>
<p>So I paid my Â£3.00 and looked forward to the process that was to follow.</p>
<p>I then waited, and waited, and waited, and then on Saturday this happened:</p>
<p><img alt="I got purged" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/IGotPurged.png"></p>
<p>In other words.... I got <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/labourpurge">purged</a>.</p>
<p>And a couple of events before this have me wondering and a little suspicious
of how this went down.</p>
<p>I'll make clear here though: my application to be a supporter was 100%
genuine. As I say above, this was a first step on a road that I felt might
actually end up with me joining a party -- something I've never done before.
It wasn't something I did lightly. It was something I did after conversations
with a couple of other people where the conversations were about genuine
concern with how our country is shaping up right now.</p>
<p>Even as late as a week before I got the above email I was having a conversation
with my nephew who, I'm deeply proud to say, is a very politically-aware
teenager (far more than I was at his age) and is actually a member of the
Labour Party. The conversation was about how I was starting to trust the party
again and how I was even considering joining depending on how events went.</p>
<p>My application wasn't some joke thing, wasn't done on a whim, wasn't done to
try and skew any result. It was done because it was something I cared about
and wanted to explore further.</p>
<p>Anyway, come late on last week I'd had no sort of ballot email and, prompted
by a couple of emails from a couple of the leadership campaign groups, I
filled in the form to ask them to hurry it up. I think it was late on Thursday
evening (2015-09-03) or early Friday morning (2015-09-04).</p>
<p>A little later on Friday this happened (Anroid twitter):</p>
<p><img alt="A follow from someone involved in Labour" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screenshot_2015-09-07-11-07-16.png"></p>
<p>Same follow as seen from Tweetdeck:</p>
<p><img alt="A follow from someone involved in Labour" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screen Shot 2015-09-07 at 16.17.06.png"></p>
<p>I've no idea who <a href="https://twitter.com/polycarponkundi">@polycarponkundi</a> is
but it seemed clear from their timeline that they are a Labour supporter or
even member and that they are a strong supporter of the Liz Kendall leadership
campaign.</p>
<p>I didn't think too much of the follow; it seemed like an unusual coincidence
that I'd chase up my ballot email and then someone apparently involved in
the party would follow me, but coincidences happen.</p>
<p>Then, the following day, I get the letter telling me to sod off. Suddenly the
coincidence seems less of a coincidence. I go and check the profile and notice
that they've even unfollowed me, just a couple of days after the follow.</p>
<p><img alt="That account no longer follows me" src="/attachments/2015/09/07/Screen Shot 2015-09-07 at 16.21.45.png"></p>
<p>Note the lack of "follows @davepdotorg" in the profile?</p>
<p>Very odd.</p>
<p>Right now I'm not drawing any firm conclusions about what happened, and I have
<a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/640829279966765056">asked them what the follow and unfollow was all about</a>.
It would be unfair of me to decide the events were connected without asking
first.</p>
<p>All of this though has made something clear to me. Labour have decided that
they never want my support, ever again. I have it in writing. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>What I actually have in writing is an email that says <em>"we're taking and keeping
your Â£3.00 and we're calling you a liar while we do this. If you want to
prove that you're not a liar you need to actually join us, actually send us
even more money. Oh, and by the way, we're not going to tell you what evidence
we have that you're a liar, so ner."</em></p>
<p>Thank you Labour. At least I know where I stand now. You can safely assume
that you'll never have my support ever again.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I seem to have somehow messed up my left hand. I'm not sure what the problem is
yet, I'm speaking to the doctor and have had an x-ray to check out one possible
cause, but the simple fact is that my left hand has an issue. Sometimes the
arm is painful, pretty much all the time a couple of fingers are near-numb.
One unfortunate side-effect of this is that I'm finding typing rather
uncomfortable. Except, that is, when I'm typing in my
<a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">iMac</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the vast majority of the typing I do is on my Windows 7 desktop
machine I decided it was time to look at getting a new keyboard, one that
was as comfortable to type on as the Apple keyboard. Given that I really needed
to be in a position where I could actually try the keyboards out I headed
off to the local PC World.</p>
<p>Long story short: none of the Windows-oriented keyboards I tried did it for me.
None were as comfortable as the Mac keyboard. I tried a few a couple of times
and then suddenly had an idea... Apple do a full-size keyboard and, from what
I've seen in the past, it does work with Windows, after a fashion. So I went
to talk to the Apple guy, checked they had one in stock, handed over Â£40 and
headed home again.</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Keyboard" src="/attachments/2015/08/17/Apple-Keyboard.jpg"></p>
<p>Having now worked with it for a couple of days I think this might be one of
the best keyboard purchases I've ever made.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, of course. The keyboard isn't designed to work with Windows,
it's designed for the Mac. But for the most part I'm finding that it's not
confusing and I'm adapting just fine.</p>
<p>I had to go searching for an unofficial layout that I could install (one
that's actually old enough that it doesn't even say it supports Windows 7)
and installing that seems to have cured a few issues. The issues I do have
remaining are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the application I'm in, @ and " are swapped. Really, I'm not
kidding. In SublimeText @ and " are the right way round; in Skype they're the
wrong way round. I suspect that this might be down to the fact that I need
to restart applications so they take up the new mapping (a reboot of the machine
might be in order here).</li>
<li>The keyboard has no marked insert toggle key. There is one, it's the 0 on
the numeric keyboard if you have (also missing, but with a mapping) numlock
turned off.</li>
<li>Alt and Win are the wrong way round. The Cmd key acts as the Win key and it
is in the same position as Alt is normally in. I'm actually adapting to this
pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Apple hates the # key. Much like I have problems typing # on the iMac, the
same issue exists when typing on Windows too. Whereas on the iMac I have to
use Alt-3 to get a #, on the Windows machine I have to use Ctrl-Alt-3. Not
ideal but it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>They're the main issues I've discovered so far. It's possible that there are
other niggles waiting for me but, hopefully, there's workarounds for them too.
Mostly though I'm finding that the small adjustments I have to make to how I
work are worth it given just how comfortable this keyboard is to type on.</p>
<p>I really do wish there was a Windows-oriented keyboard that had the exact same
build quality.</p></div>

    <p>
      Posted on 2015-08-13 09:15 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/tech.html">Tech</a>

          &#8226; Tagged with
              <a href="https://blog.davep.org/tag/facebook.html">Facebook</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I've never really liked Facebook. I forget exactly when I ended up on there --
perhaps 2009 or so -- but I can remember exactly who to blame. It was all the
fault of <a href="http://richd.me/">Rich Daley</a>. On an atheism-oriented BB that has
long since fallen off the net he convinced me that it was "<em>X</em> for adults"
(where <em>X</em> was a popular early social network whose name totally escapes me
now) and I fell for it.</p>
<p>And I hated it.</p>
<p>But I stuck with it.</p>
<p>I stuck with it until September 2011. I realised that after
a few years of using it I still found the site confusing, ugly, unfriendly
(in terms of design) and somewhat invasive too. On top of that I'd made the
common mistake of allowing anyone I'd ever run unto on the net add me there
and so the contact list was huge and out of control -- I didn't really know
who most of the people were. So <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/jPqNPhg7idp">I deleted the account</a>.</p>
<p>Back then there was, as I recall, no explicit delete option, or to do the
delete thing you had to deactive and wait 14 days, or some such thing. I know
that I followed the advice in the docs and did whatever was required to have my
account totally deleted.</p>
<p>This week, at the urging of friends, I finally decided to create an account
again. I initially tried to create the account using the old email address
(well, actually, a variation on it that would appear to be the same to
systems that understand the significance of a + in an email address) but it
told me that the address was in use. Which was a worry.</p>
<p>So I created the account using a different address (my actual "main" address
this time, as opposed to my Google address) and set about setting it up.</p>
<p><img alt="So I'm on Facebook again" src="/attachments/2015/08/13/Screen Shot 2015-08-13 at 08.46.26.png"></p>
<p>In doing so I tried to tell it that I wanted to associate my old address with this
new account and, again, it refused, telling me there was an active account for
that address.</p>
<p>I then went and checked and, sure enough, there was my old account, still
there, all the data, nothing had changed!</p>
<p>Fucking Facebook!</p>
<p>These days, however, it does look like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674">there are very clear instructions on
how to actually fully delete an account</a>, so I've tried again for the old
account. It's another 14 days of deactivation but with an actual promise that,
yes, this time, they'll delete all my shit.</p>
<p>They better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I have a shiny new Facebook account. And I still find it confusing,
ugly, unfriendly (in terms of design) and somewhat invasive.</p></div>

      <div><p>By the looks of things, with the recent updates to their desktop applications,
Evernote have discovered the joys of pop-ups for advertising purposes. I'm
finding it just as annoying as it was back in the days when people thought it
was the smart way to make you buy things on the web.</p>
<p><img alt="Yay! Pop-up advertising!" src="/attachments/2015/07/09/Screen Shot 2015-07-09 at 16.15.25.png"></p>
<p>Now, to be fair, the pop-up you see above is the one on my iMac and that at
least has the good taste to only pop up <em>within</em> the application itself
(although the Evernote icon in the dock at the bottom of the screen kept
jumping around like it <em>really</em> wanted attention when this happened). The
Windows one, however, is much worse.</p>
<p>I've actually not had a chance to capture a copy yet as it normally has the
habit of getting in the way while I'm actually trying to do something; but
the Windows version has the bad taste to actually pop up over my desktop. Yes,
that's right, over my bloody desktop!</p>
<p>In both cases it's advertising Evernote's paid-for tiers in a way that it never
has before. It's seriously annoying.</p>
<p>Now, before anyone pipes up that it's a company that needs money to keep things
going... I know. I don't mind that. I don't mind the odd nag here and there.
More to the point I actually don't mind paying for software and services. I
actually do pay for software and services. There's a handful of different tools
and the like that I make good use of every month which I pay for because they're
worth paying for.</p>
<p>Evernote is one that I've been considering paying for too. The problem is, what
they offer in the paid versions isn't really anything I need. Everything I use
Evernote for can be done in the free version; I have no <em>need</em> to pay for it.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a good argument to be made in favour of the idea that if
you benefit from a service you should pay for it anyway so that it doesn't go
away. Having watched the likes of Catch and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springpad">Springpad</a> disappear I think that's
a very compelling argument and one that has had me, in recent months, thinking
I should buy some paid-for Evernote tier.</p>
<p>The problem I face now though is this: this move by Evernote to go with a
pop-up nagware model, especially one that's willing to pop up nagging windows
on my desktop, gives me the feeling that the company is struggling and getting
desperate. While this <em>should</em> have me thinking that now is a really good time
to pay for something I appreciate it's actually having the opposite effect.
It's having me wonder if, in fact, I should be looking for an alternative that
isn't giving this impression.</p>
<p>Yes, even one that I'd need to pay for.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Last night, before heading for bed, I noticed that there was an update available
for OS X on the iMac, and also for iTunes. Despite the late hour I decided
to do the update anyway. OS X updated pretty smoothly (albeit with some rather
unhelpful progress bars that appear to give estimated times that have no
relation to reality), as did iTunes.</p>
<p>I was then told that there was an update for my iPod as well (all part of this
new thing where Apple have invented Spotify, obviously). I let that start doing
its thing and that's where things got odd. First it started the update and the
iPod appeared to insist that it wasn't plugged into the iMac, even though it
was. Then I gave it a second go (after unplugging it and plugging it in
again) and it all seemed to go through just fine, only...</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iPod?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Photo 01-07-2015 10 21 56.png"></p>
<p>...while the iPod was pretty sure it was now running iOS 8.4, iTunes on the iMac
had other ideas:</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.22.16.png"></p>
<p>The following morning iTunes kept insisting that it needed to do the update
so, even though the iPod was obviously up to date, I let it do it anyway. After
it'd gone through the update process again it still insisted that the iPod
was running 8.3 rather than 8.4. Until, that is, I unplgged it and plugged it
back in again.</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.26.20.png"></p>
<p>So now it all seems fine. I just had to do a variation on "have you tried
turning it off and on again?"</p>
<p>Once again I find myself running into things on a Mac that are very common
elsewhere, on other operating systems, and which Mac owners would often have
you believe weren't an issue.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>My history with computers starts with a Sinclair ZX81 in the early 1980s,
followed shortly by a Vic20, then on to the BBC B and fairly quickly on to
very early IBM PC compatible machines. In the early 1990s I added OS/2 (during
the introduction of Warp) and not too long after that GNU/Linux. Along the way
I've also used the odd Unix here and there as well as CP/M, RSTS and VMS.</p>
<p>Aside from an inherited Mac whose model name escapes me, and whose operating
system version also escapes me, I've never really had too much exposure to
the world of Apple.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back all of that changed.</p>
<p>It's quite a long time since I had a Unix of some form as a desktop machine
and I was starting to get the urge to have one again. During all of this time
I've had a GNU/Linux box or two available but for the past few years I've
always used them from the (dis)comfort of my Windows desktop. Generally that
was fine because the uses I had were not desktop.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short: I started out thinking that I wanted some form of
Unix on my desk again and, somehow, ended up walking out of a shop with
an iMac.</p>
<p>Given the above history I thought it might be fun to jot down my experiences
in the first couple of weeks. This will be a vaguely random wander through my
experiences. It's not a review. It's not even really intended as a judgement
of the machine and the operating system. It's nothing more than a collection
of notes of what I found and my reaction to what I found.</p>
<h1>The keyboard</h1>
<p>The first strong reaction I had to the machine was regarding the keyboard. I
thought I was going to hate it. I've had the misfortune of using various
chiclet keyboards over the years and I've hated every single one. I find that I
can't type on them, that it doesn't feel right, and that it makes my fingers
ache badly if I spend too much time using them. My history and experiences
has always been such that I've generally preferred very mechanical-feeling
keyboards.</p>
<p>This just wasn't the case with the iMac keyboard. I don't know why, I still
don't know why, but this feels like one of the most comfortable keyboards
I've ever typed on. Despite the keys being chiclet style they move in a very
positive way that really surprised me. It doesn't hurt to type, at all, and
I'm finding I can type faster on this keyboard than any other I've typed on
before.</p>
<p>There is a flipside though. I find the whole design far too cramped. Even now,
a couple of weeks later, as I type this on it, I wish the keys were just a little
bigger and just a little more spaced out. I'm adjusting, of course -- much of
this is about muscle memory -- but it does mean that it's in a constant fight
with my "knowledge" of my other main keyboards.</p>
<p>And then there's the keys that it lacks.</p>
<p>I'm still finding that this is a terrible keyboard for a programmer. For one
thing, here on the UK version of the keyboard, there's no # key. At least,
there's no simple, comfortable, direct access to the # key. Any time I want
to type a # I have to shift my left hand to find the (I think it's called
the) option key and hit 3. Shift 3 is Â£. And it gets even worse. This setup
doesn't work at all in GNU emacs so I then have to put the keyboard in
Australian mode so I can use shift-3 to get a #.</p>
<p>Why there isn't a proper # key is beyond me.</p>
<p>And then there's the (on the version that came with this iMac) complete lack
of page keys as well as home and end. Overall this makes the whole keyboard
feel very unfriendly to programmers and also to writers in general.</p>
<p>This, of course, is my bias and muscle memory from PCs showing. I'm still not
convinced that that bias and muscle memory is wrong.</p>
<h1>The mouse</h1>
<p>When I first started with it I hated the mouse. I should be fair and point out
that, overall, I hate mice anyway. For a good 20 years I've thrown away every
mouse I've ever had turn up with a machine and have made use of a trackball
instead. I find that a trackball gives me far more control and is far more
comfortable. So, initially, I put the Apple mouse to one side and plugged
in a trackball instead.</p>
<p>For reasons I forget now I found myself needed to use the Apple mouse again.
Once I did that I decided to "force" myself to give it a fair shot and, now,
I'm glad I did. Much like with the keyboard, despite me having a bias against
what it is, this has turned out to be one of the most comfortable mice I've
ever used. It sits right in the hand, the lack of actual buttons means I don't
have to shape my hand to fit the design but, instead, the design allows for
how my hand rests. I also rather like the gestures too.</p>
<p>This is the first mouse that has stayed on my desktop. I'm surprised.</p>
<p>By the way, whoever thought that the "natural" scroll option, which is on by
default, was "natural", is barking mad.</p>
<h1>The GUI</h1>
<p>One of the main intended uses for this machine is the Unix shell, working
inside the terminal. Given that the actual UI of the OS doesn't matter so
much to me. That said, I'm finding it pretty pleasant. I find it a lot
tidier-looking than Windows, although I also find it more frustrating in
some places.</p>
<p>One good example is in the Finder, when I have a folder open. I find that it's
quite common for me, on Windows, when I have an Explorer window open, to want
to copy the path of the folder for use elsewhere. That's very easy to do
because the path is in an edit field at the top of the window and can be
edited and copied. If there's a way to do this with the OS X Finder I've
yet to figure that one one.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm still not getting used to, and I'm still very unconvinced by,
as a design decision, is the business of having an application's menus always
appear at the top of the screen disconnected from the application windows
themselves. I appreciate that this is a very Apple/Mac way of doing things
but I really can't get used to the idea -- especially given that it gives
the (incorrect) impression that the whole GUI is really single tasking.</p>
<p>On the whole though most of this doesn't matter too much to me. Large parts
of what I'm doing is in the terminal window, with other parts of it being
in my editors of choice (either SublimeText or GNU emacs, depending on what
I'm doing) or inside Google Chrome. In other words the general experience is
one that carries over most of the main operating systems I've used on
desktop machines.</p>
<h1>Installing software</h1>
<p>For an operating system that prides itself on being simple to use and easy
to understand, and especially one whose bigger fans sell as being simple to
use and easy to understand (especially in relation to Windows), the whole
business of installing software seems very confusing and very scrappy.</p>
<p>So far I've found a few different ways of installing software and none of it
makes a whole lot of sense to me without going and searching about it and
reading up on it. Sometimes I download an app and all I need to do is drag
it into the Applications folder. Other times I get a zip which I have to open
and then... it can go a couple of different ways. Sometimes I get a 'dmg' and
when I open that up I get a window where I have to drag one icon onto another
icon in that window to do the install. Sometimes I get something like the last
one I mention but instead I have to double-click on an icon that's in the
window.</p>
<p>There might even be other options I've had to follow. I forget now.</p>
<p>And then there's the business of removing software! That seems to be complete
chaos. In some cases you delete the app and it's all good. In other cases
you need to do that and hunt down some other bits and remove them too. In
other cases it seems like the author has supplied their own uninstaller.</p>
<p>We've been here before. I know this setup rather well. This is exactly the
sort of world we lived in back when Windows 3.1 was a new thing. This came as
and still is a massive surprise to me: OS X is as sophisticated as a fancy
shell that ran on top of MS DOS when it comes to software management.</p>
<h1>Doing the right thing, except when not</h1>
<p>While I'm on the subject of the famous great design of the Mac... what's up
with the business of seeing the time format? The system preferences seem
very flexible when it comes to setting date and time formats. I really like
the dialog that provides this:</p>
<p><img alt="Setting the date format" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.23.39.png"></p>
<p>As you might see above, my preference when it comes to date formats is to have
everything in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> format.
Having set that I then noticed that the time shown in the menu bar on the
desktop was.... whatever the hell Apple appear to have decided for me!</p>
<p><img alt="This is not the date format I asked for" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.26.18.png"></p>
<p>Even Windows lets me set the date format as I want it in the desktop time
display. Apple, meanwhile, seem to provide a great method of letting you
set your date and time formats "just so" and then they seem to just go right
ahead and ignore your preference in the one place you'll see it the most.</p>
<h1>If you have a Mac, you have software I wrote on it (I think)</h1>
<p>From what I could tell every Mac has a copy of GNU emacs installed, out of the
box. That actually kind of impressed me. Sure, it's a rather out of date
version of GNU emacs, but it's a copy of GNU emacs and that's all that matters.</p>
<p><img alt="It's a GNU emacs!" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.31.18.png"></p>
<p>That fact actually means something rather interesting, to me. See, there's
two small packages that are part of GNU emacs that I originally wrote. One is
called 5x5, the other quickurl.</p>
<p><img alt="My rubbish claim to fame" src="/attachments/2015/06/27/Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 19.32.58.png"></p>
<p>So, yeah, from what I can see, on every new Mac you'll find two bodies of
code that I originally wrote, pre-installed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, shitty claim to fame. I'll take it anyway. ;)</p>
<h1>Overall initial impression</h1>
<p>Overall my initial impression is a good one. The Apple iMac seems to make for
a pretty good Unix workstation. The keyboard layout could do with some work
to make it more friendly to programmers (well, to this programmer) but
overall it all makes sense and is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If most of what you do is actually online then I'd say that an iMac would be
a huge waste of money. If you want a desktop machine for web browsing and
generally working "in the cloud" then you'd do a lot better to buy a Chromebase
(or, of course, a Chromebook if you're looking at Macbooks). On top of this,
if most of what you're doing is online but you want to do some client-side
stuff such as image/video editing and gaming then I struggle to see how an iMac
would be a good choice too. For the money it's hilariously underpowered
when compared to a reasonably equivalent Windows PC (or, of course, GNU/Linux
machine if what you want to do can be done there).</p>
<p>My own reasons for purchase were about having a desktop Unix workstation that
I could install various compilers on so I could muck about and work on some
fun projects I want to get done. It was an unusual extravagance that I don't
regret and, so far, I've been pleased with.</p>
<p>There's very few people I'd actually recommend one to though as it seems
pretty clear to me that, generally, their money could buy them so much more.</p>
<p>But it's a nice new shiny toy. ;)</p></div>

      <div><p>Following on from
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/06/25/did-google-just-break-wear-timers.html">yesterday's problem with the Android Wear timer</a>
I think I now have a solution. It came up
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/RZujypG7EyF">while chatting with Mike McLoughlin about the issue</a>.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that this problem felt like one that I've seen a number of
times before with Google stuff. One thing that's rather common (in many cases
for very obvious reasons -- you can't cover the whole world in one go) with
Google is how they struggle to get languages and localisation right. This
felt like it was a similar issue. Mike had reported that his watch appeared
to be unaffected by the issue (I'm guessing he's on the latest version of
Wear -- the conversation headed off in a different direction before that
became necessary) so I checked what his language was on his phone. Turns out
he was the same as me: British English.</p>
<p>So much for that idea.</p>
<p>But then he suggested switching to US English and back again.</p>
<p>Happy enough to apply a very Microsoft "turn it off and on again" approach to
a Google device (really, all big tech companies really are the same and
really do suffer the same issues) I switched to en-US on the phone and tried
setting a timer in voice on the watch.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>So then I switched back to en-GB on the phone and...</p>
<p><img alt="I appear to have timers working again" src="/attachments/2015/06/26/Timer Running on Watch.png"></p>
<p>...it still worked!</p>
<p>I've tried setting timers in voice on the watch a few times since and it's yet
to fail.</p>
<p>It would appear, as odd as it is, that this is the fix. Well, a fix.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p></div>
