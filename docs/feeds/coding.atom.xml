ago&lt;/a&gt;, I've just &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0"&gt;released v0.2.0 of
Tinboard&lt;/a&gt;. There's
just one small change in this, but I think it's a really useful one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the top-left corner of the screen there's a menu of main filters, letting
you switch between seeing all bookmarks, or a combination of read, unread,
public, private, etc... In using the application I quickly realised that it
would be handy to have bookmark counts in that menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I added that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Counts in the filters menu" src="/attachments/2023/12/21/filters-menu.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These counts are a little different from those in the tags list, in that
they always show the number of matching bookmarks amongst &lt;em&gt;all recorded
bookmarks&lt;/em&gt;, not just those currently on display (and so subject to any sort
of filter that's in play).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is the right approach here. I know for sure that that's what
I want from this, and I am writing this for me after all...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's handy about this is that it makes it easier for me to see how many
bookmarks haven't been tagged, and also how many I haven't looked back over
and marked as read. This is already helping me get to untagged-zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinboard can be installed with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; or (ideally) &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/"&gt;from
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard"&gt;source is available on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="terminal"></category><category term="textual"></category></entry><entry><title>Tinboard</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/12/19/tinboard.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-19T09:47:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-19T09:47:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-12-19:/2023/12/19/tinboard.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new pet project, in part done
as a &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/"&gt;Textual&lt;/a&gt; "dogfooding" project, but
also because this is a tool I've been wanting for a while now: a
terminal-based client for the &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/"&gt;Pinboard bookmarking
service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dogfooding side of the development has been helping, uncovering a couple
of fun bugs in Textual; plus the act of building this has let me try out a
few of the newer features we've recently added to the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important though is this is a tool I actually &lt;strong&gt;wanted&lt;/strong&gt;,
and I'm using pretty often. I've written a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Textual-based
applications over the past year, most small examples, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth"&gt;some quite a bit
bigger&lt;/a&gt;, but none of them really
form part of my daily workflow. This changes with Tinboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tinboard in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tinboard.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinboard is designed as a fully-featured client, allowing for the creation
of new Bookmarks, complete with tag suggestion support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding a new bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/new-bookmark.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are tag suggestions pulled from Pinboard, but entry of tags can
auto-complete, taking completions from both the suggested tags and also tags
used amongst your own bookmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Auto-complete of tags" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tag-suggest.gif#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feature was really easy to add thanks to &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/suggester/"&gt;the &lt;code&gt;Suggester&lt;/code&gt;
API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the
&lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/21/textual-0380-adds-a-syntax-aware-textarea/"&gt;recently-added&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code&gt;TextArea&lt;/code&gt; widget the add/edit dialog allows for proper full editing of the
extended text description of the bookmark too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Editing a bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/edit.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat here is a lack of word-wrapping; but this will be arriving in an
update to Textual early in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as all the usual add/edit/delete facilities, Tinboard is also
designed to make it pretty easy to find bookmarks too. There are filtering
options for seeing all read/unread, public/private and tagged/untagged
bookmarks; this makes bookmark management really easy for me because I can
filter for all the untagged and private bookmarks, which are likely the ones
that need editing and expanding on, and tidy up my bookmark library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also, of course, full text search too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Text search entry" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-entry.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a filter or search is in operation, the related tags and the like react
too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A search result being shown" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-result.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I've made a point of doing in Tinboard is leaning pretty hard
on the &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/command_palette/"&gt;Command
Palette&lt;/a&gt;. No
functionality is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; available by it (I've done my best to make sure that
keyboard is the primary input device here, with keyboard shortcuts for as
much as possible). Initially I approached this as a "for the sake of
completeness" feature, but already I'm finding that it's a pretty quick
method of pulling up a tag filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The command palette in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/command-palette.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help make all the features as discoverable possible, I've also ensured
there's a pretty comprehensive help screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Help" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/help.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's a few more things I'd like to add. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard"&gt;via GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/"&gt;via
PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an environment that
has &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; installed you should be able to get up and going with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tinboard
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="terminal"></category><category term="textual"></category></entry><entry><title>Evolve Words</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/10/31/evolve-words.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-31T21:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-10-31T21:39:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-10-31:/2023/10/31/evolve-words.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This follows on from my &lt;a href="/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.
If you've not read that, it's worth having a dive in first for the
background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair
of scripts. The first one, called &lt;code&gt;selection&lt;/code&gt;, did what &lt;code&gt;visual-selection&lt;/code&gt;
does, only &lt;code&gt;visual-selection&lt;/code&gt; does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a
random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target
phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As covered before: I don't remember all of the details of the conversation
that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the
lines of &lt;em&gt;"yes, but you start out and end up with something the same
length"&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;"nothing more complex is made"&lt;/em&gt; (let's gloss over the whole
"complex" thing for now... well okay let's just gloss over it, end of story;
this is just a fun coding exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about
I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the
"fitness landscape" that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a
population over and over and see what happens. Would I "randomly" create
known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would
randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a
random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that
aren't in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival
within the landscape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun
to write some code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version became &lt;code&gt;selection2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having turned &lt;code&gt;selection&lt;/code&gt; into a TUI application with Textual, I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt;
to do the same with this code...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Evolve Words" src="/attachments/2023/10/31/evolve-words.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, because it's fun to do so, this leans heavily on the &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/"&gt;worker
API&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-plotext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out the app itself there's &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/evolve-words"&gt;a GitHub
repo&lt;/a&gt; and it can also be
installed &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/evolve-words/"&gt;from PyPi&lt;/a&gt; using
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="evolution"></category><category term="biology"></category><category term="terminal"></category><category term="textual"></category></entry><entry><title>Visual Selection</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-26T18:50:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-10-26T18:50:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-10-26:/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks I've had a couple of sessions of working on a
library to wrap &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/plotext/"&gt;Plotext&lt;/a&gt; -- a popular
terminal-based plotting library for Python -- so that it can easily be used
in Textual apps;
&lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-plotext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel it's come together pretty well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... I've been itching to find a reason to use it in a project of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the mid-2000s, when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB"&gt;phpBB&lt;/a&gt;
systems were still the fashion, I used to hang out on a site that was
chiefly aimed at the atheist and secular humanist crowd. We'd get a good
number of drive-by
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism"&gt;YEC&lt;/a&gt; types who'd
want to argue (sorry... debate) and often talk nonsense about biology and
the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm no biologist, I'm no scientist, I'm just a hacker who likes to
write code for fun and profit; so any time there was a chance to write some
code to help illustrate an idea I'd jump at the chance. I forget the detail
now -- this was back in 2008; 15 years ago as of the time of writing -- but
one time I remember a conversation was taking place where someone was just
flat out claiming that "random mutation" can only cause "loss of
information" and could never lead to a "desired result", or some such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever had, read or watched those debates, you'll know the sort of
thing I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that got me thinking back then, could I write something that could give a
simple illustration of how this doesn't quite make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had a little hacking session and came up with some Ruby code&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that
did what I felt was the job. You'd give it a phrase you wanted it to
generate (a stand-in for the current "fitness landscape", in effect), it
would then generate a totally random string of that length, and then would
set about mutating it, finding mutations that were "fitter" than others (a
stand in for selection), breed the best two so far (randomly copy one chunk
from another to create a child), then repeat over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote it I wasn't sure what to expect; would it ever finish
given a reasonably large target string?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got posted to the BB and of course wasn't in any way persuasive to them
(honestly I never expected it would be). I seem to recall it being
hand-waved away with calls of there obviously being an intelligent designer
involved&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the "meanwhile..." in this: a few times this year I've thought it
could be fun to rework this in Python (it's really not that complex after
all; just a string-chopping loop really) and use Textual to put a fun UI on
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's what I did, complete with &lt;code&gt;textual-plotext&lt;/code&gt; plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Visual Selection in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/26/visual-selection.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, 15 years on, this isn't going to convince anyone of the underlying
point, I think it does serve a good educational purpose. It shows that you
can create a fun UI for the terminal, with Textual, with not a lot of code.
It also shows off how you can easily create dynamic plots. Plus -- and I
think this might be the really important one -- it shows you can write
"traditional" tight-loop code in a Textual application and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have a
responsive UI; all thanks to the &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/"&gt;worker
API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the code for this application is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;This is the target string we want to create!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;best_fit_found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shit_happens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there's some detail in the &lt;code&gt;Environment&lt;/code&gt; class, but you get the idea:
while we've not hit the target, let &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg"&gt;life find a
way&lt;/a&gt;. A loop like that would
totally bog down an application with a UI without some other work taking
place. With Textual and workers the resulting method in the application,
complete with code to send updates to the UI, really doesn't look much
different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exclusive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run_world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;worker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_current_worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;post_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WorldUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_cancelled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;best_fit_found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shit_happens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;best_fit_found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;best_fit_found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;post_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think the worker API is one of the coolest things added to
Textual and I so often see people have real &lt;em&gt;"woah!"&lt;/em&gt; moments when they get
to grips with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway... I've covered science, religion, and how Ruby is better than
Python, so I'm sure I've annoyed almost everyone. Job done I guess. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out the app itself there's &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/visual-selection"&gt;a GitHub
repo&lt;/a&gt; and it can also be
installed &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/visual-selection/"&gt;from PyPi&lt;/a&gt; using
&lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect it to be my tinker project of choice for a wee while; there's a
couple of other things I'd like to add to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly unpopular opinion with some folk who will read this, but I've
long been a fan of Ruby as a language and actually generally prefer it
to Python.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, the coder. While utterly missing the point of a simple
illustration, while apparently not understanding the concept of an
analogy, I guess at least they felt I was intelligent?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I can't
even remember what motivated me to create one now, but back in October 2008
I grabbed the &lt;code&gt;davep&lt;/code&gt; account...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Making my account" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/account-made.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and then made my &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/dict.rb"&gt;first repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First repo made" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/first-repo.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My use of the site after that was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sporadic. It looks like I'd add or
update something once or twice a year, but I wasn't a heavy user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First few years" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/first-few-years.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then around the middle of 2015 I seem to have started using it a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The next few years" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/next-few-years.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This very much shows that during those years I was working on personal stuff
that I was making available in case anyone found it useful, but also leaning
heavily on GitHub as a (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) place to keep backups of code I
cared about (or even no longer cared about). Quite a lot of that green will
likely be me having a few periods of &lt;a href="/category/emacs.html"&gt;revamping my Emacs
configuration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really fun part though starts about a year ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Working on FOSS full time" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/full-time.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty obvious when I started working at Textualize, and working on a
FOSS project full time. This is, without a doubt, the most green my
contribution graph has looked. It looks like there's a couple of days this
year where I haven't visited my desk at all, and I think this is a good
thing (I try really hard to have a life outside of coding when it comes to
weekends), but I'm also delighted to see just how busy this year looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope this carries on for a while to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, as of the time of writing, I've made 12,588 contributions that
are on GitHub. What's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fun is the fact that my first contribution
pre-dates my GitHub account by 9 years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My very first contribution" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/very-first-contrib.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one's pretty easy to explain: this is back from when I was involved
with
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_(programming_language)"&gt;Harbour&lt;/a&gt;.
Back then we were using SourceForge to manage the project (as was the
fashion at the time), and at some point in the past whoever is maintaining
the project has pulled the full history into GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="/attachments/2023/10/01/contributions.png"&gt;contribution history on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is actually older than my
adult son. I suspect it's older than at least one person I work with. :-/ &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm informed that this isn't the case&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; apparently I'm either bad at
estimating people's ages, or bad at remembering them; or both.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far off. :-/&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

my personal website&lt;/a&gt;, in this case
"porting" over many of the files that made up the old "miscellaneous stuff"
section of the site. If I'm honest, most if not all of the things in there
are no longer relevant (like: who really needs a shell script to make
&lt;code&gt;gnuplot&lt;/code&gt; plots from files pulled off a 1990s-era Garmin handheld GPS
unit?), but I thought I'd keep them kicking around "just in case".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wee section I wasn't going to get rid of though was my scans of three
pages from a UK magazine called &lt;em&gt;Personal Computer News&lt;/em&gt;. These contain
&lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/misc/grid-bike/"&gt;Grid Bike&lt;/a&gt;; a game I wrote for the
VIC-20, all in BASIC, and got published. For my efforts I got a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;
cheque for £40! If that doesn't seem like much to you, trust me, to 1983 me
this was &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 16k RAM pack with the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, while trying to improve some of the links in the text, I
decided to see if there was now an archive online somewhere and, sure
enough, there is: &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews001-18Mar1983/"&gt;in the obvious
place&lt;/a&gt;.
This means that my web site isn't the only copy of my program on the net. If
you go to the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews041-21Dec1983/page/n9/mode/2up"&gt;December 21st 1983
edition&lt;/a&gt;
and turn to around page 84, there I am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The cover of PCN" src="/attachments/2023/08/14/PCN-cover.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I'm almost tempted to try and get an emulator up and running
and get the code going again. How much fun would it be to add a video to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson"&gt;my
YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, of me playing one of
the very first games I wrote?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Website: Norton Guide information moved</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/13/website-norton-guide-information-moved.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-13T10:02:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-13T10:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-13:/2023/08/13/website-norton-guide-information-moved.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I've spent a wee bit of time tinkering with the configuration
of &lt;a href="/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html"&gt;the planned complete remake of my personal
website&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this I made an
effort to "port" over a section of the site. The choice for the first
section to move was easy enough: &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/"&gt;Norton
Guides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the parts of my old site, this is probably the most useful in terms
of &lt;em&gt;"contains information that isn't generally available out there on the
web elsewhere and some folk might find it useful"&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, at some point in
the past, someone edited the Wikipedia page for Norton Guides and linked to
mine as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So getting that one back up and running as soon as possible made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not added &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; bit of Norton Guide code to the main page, instead
just pulling over and tidying up what was there before. On the other hand,
just hacking on Markdown makes it all so much easier so I may expand on it a
bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really important part was moving over &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/file-format/"&gt;the file format
details&lt;/a&gt;. This, I feel, is
the information that people will be looking for, if anyone is ever looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, proper start made; there's content beyond the landing page. There's
still a lot to weed out and move over, and I think there's a lot of tweaking
and the like with the configuration to do too. But the ball is rolling now.
Ever time I get a spare hour and the desire to sit at my desk I can pick a
section, look it over, decide if it deserves to come over, and act on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, at this rate I might even end up with an actively-maintained website
again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>The reboot begins</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-11T13:19:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-11T13:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-11:/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And I'm off! This morning I spent a good amount of time going through the
sources for the old version of &lt;a href="http://www.davep.org"&gt;&lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
removing everything that won't be needed any more, and also building up a
rough TODO list of things I may want to recreate as content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done, &lt;a href="/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html"&gt;as mentioned earlier
today&lt;/a&gt;, I started work on
building the site around Pelican. Pretty quickly though I started to feel
that that was going to be a bad choice. While Pelican felt like a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;
fit for this blog -- mainly because it seems to be very blog-oriented -- it
was feeling a bit clunky for a general website that would have a handful of
static pages at best; likely something I wouldn't be updating too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put it aside and went on with my morning, doing normal Friday domestic
stuff like the weekly supermarket shop. It was while I was out doing that
that I realised the obvious answer: use &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/"&gt;what we use for the Textual
docs&lt;/a&gt; and what's been used for
&lt;a href="https://label.dev/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;label.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/"&gt;Material for
MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just spent about 40 minutes after lunch kicking that off and it was
really straightforward. Of course the result is horrifically cookie-cutter
in terms of its look -- such is the way that &lt;code&gt;mkdocs-material&lt;/code&gt; sites end up
looking out of the box -- but I don't much care about that; what's important
is that I've got a placeholder page in place, and I've quickly built a
framework for writing and publishing the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the plan: now that the welcome page is in place and there's
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on my domain that looks like a working website again I can start
to slowly drag in old content in a new format. Heck, if I'm careful I might
even be able to retain some of the old URLs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer-term plans might involve finally sorting out &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; support (yes,
even today, my site is &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;-only), and perhaps adding some sort of RSS
feed so there's a record of when changes are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that... hopefully that'll be about it and perhaps the website will
last another 22 years running on top of the same engine (actually that part
should be easier because the "engine" is now local and it generates a static
site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes who'll last longer, the site or me?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Admitting defeat on my website</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-11T08:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-11T08:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-11:/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had &lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt; since very late 1999. Initially it started as a domain
used just for email; while I did have a website, around that time it was
still hosted on my then-ISPs hosting service, with a mirror on a friend's
web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so later I finally did a proper revamp of my website and finally
settled on &lt;code&gt;www.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; as the place to point people to. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;, when
I made that move, that's when I decided to write my own website engine in
php. It was fun. It worked. I didn't want to code backend stuff (I don't
think the backend vs frontend distinction was even a thing we were talking
about then) so hacking it together in an unholy mix of ruby to generate
various static files that live in the filesystem and then php to turn them
into actual HTML made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The earliest version of davep.org I can find" src="/attachments/2023/08/11/davep-org.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heavily maintained the site for many years; keeping the same engine,
tweaking the styles, adding features and content. I figure some time around
2013 or 2014 I probably stopped being quite so active in messing with it,
and then in the last 5 or 6 years I've pretty much neglected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neglect shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... php has changed. Quiet a lot. It's one of those languages I
used back in the day and pay no attention to. Then earlier this week I
noticed that there must have been an update on the host and huge parts of my
site broke, lots of content missing, pretty much useless and dead in the
water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did briefly think about breaking out the latest and greatest php locally,
setting things up to investigate what's going on, and seeing if I could
breathe some more life into it; but really what's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all these years I'm finally admitting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, on the home page, I've just got a placeholder saying that bitrot
finally ate my website and that I'm going to start again from scratch.
That's my plan: given that &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html"&gt;I had a good experience moving this blog over to
Pelican&lt;/a&gt; I
think I'm going to build a new &lt;code&gt;www.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; with Pelican. Where possible
I'll try and drag some of the old content over, but I'm also going to use
this opportunity to have a proper digital spring clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no planned timescale for this, but this morning I've spent an hour
or so over coffee, branching the repo for the site and pruning out all the
stuff I know I won't need and don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try and drop the odd update in here as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="php"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>A new GitHub profile README</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/03/making-my-github-banner.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-03T08:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-03T08:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-03:/2023/07/03/making-my-github-banner.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My new GitHub banner" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/davep/main/davep.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since GitHub introduced the &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme"&gt;profile
README&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I've had a massively low-effort one in place. I made the repo, quickly wrote
the file, and then sort of forgot about it. Well, I didn't so much forget as
just keep looking at it and thinking "I should do something better with that
one day".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, while there are lots of fancy approaches out there, and lots of
neat generator tools and the like... they just weren't for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then yesterday, over my second morning coffee, after &lt;a href="/2023/07/02/catching-up.html"&gt;getting my blog
environment up and going again&lt;/a&gt;, I had an
idea. It could be cool to use &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.save_screenshot"&gt;Textual's screenshot
facility&lt;/a&gt;
to make something terminal-themed! I mean, while it's not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; I am these
days, so much of what I'm doing right now is aimed at the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... what to do? Then I thought it could be cool to knock up some sort of
login screen type thing; with a banner. One visit to an online large
terminal text generator site later, I had some banner text. All that was
left was to write &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/davep/blob/main/make_banner.py"&gt;a simple Textual application to create the
"screen"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main layout is simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ComposeResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;banner&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PRATTLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;github.com/davep login: [reverse] [/]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;NAME&lt;/code&gt; contains the banner and &lt;code&gt;PRATTLE&lt;/code&gt; contains the "login message".
With some &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/CSS/"&gt;Textual CSS&lt;/a&gt; sprinkled
over it to give the exact layout and colour I wanted, all that was left was
to make the snapshot. This was easy enough too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the whole thing isn't fully documented just yet, Textual does have &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.run_test"&gt;a
great tool for automatically running an application and interacting with
it&lt;/a&gt;; that
meant I could easily write a function to load up my app and save the
screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;make_banner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GitHubBannerApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pilot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;pilot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save_screenshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;davep.svg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that needs running async, but that's simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;make_banner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw in a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; so I don't forget what I'm supposed to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;.PHONY:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;all:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;pipenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;make_banner.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that's it! Job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here onward I guess I could have some real fun with this. It would be
simple enough I guess to modify the code so that it changes what's displayed
over time; perhaps show a "last login" value that relates to recently
activity or something; any number of things; and then run it in a cron job
and update the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though... I'll stick with keeping things nice and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually kind of annoying when they introduced it because the
repo it uses is named after your user name. I already had a &lt;code&gt;davep&lt;/code&gt;
repo: it was a private repo where I was slowly working on a (now
abandoned, I'll start it again some day I'm sure) ground-up rewrite of
my &lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt; website.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

about to start working at &lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io"&gt;Textualize&lt;/a&gt;, and
building Open-source software is important to the company.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan"&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; -- the CEO -- is all about building
in public. If you follow him on Twitter you'll notice that his Python coding
adventure tweets actually outnumber is cooking tweets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has long been a supporter of and fan of &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"&gt;Free
Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"&gt;Open-source
software&lt;/a&gt;, and has made
some small contributions along the way, I've also always made a point of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/"&gt;building my own tools in public&lt;/a&gt;. In most cases
they're things that are likely only helpful to me, but some are more
generally useful. The point being though: it's all there in case it's
helpfull to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that, as much as possible, when I'm writing code, I write it as
if it's going to be visible in public and someone else is going to be
reading it. I try and make the code tidy. I try and comment it well. I try
(but don't always manage for personal projects) to fully document it. The
important thing here being that someone coming to the code fresh should be
able to follow what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against that background, and having just gone through the process of handing
off almost 5 years of work to someone else as a left an employer, I got to
thinking: we should always "build in public", even if it's in private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started with my previous employer, and even to the day I left, I was
the only software developer there. I worked with a team who wrote code, but
being software developers wasn't what they did. Bioinformaticians and
machine learning scientists have other things to be doing. But, as I wrote
my code, I wrote every line assuming they, or some other developer down the
line, would be reading it. Pretty much every line was written for an
audience I couldn't see and didn't fully know. This, as mentioned above,
meant trying to keep the code clean, ensuring it was commented in helpful
ways, ensuring the documentation was helpful, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't just about the code. Any non-trivial system will have more to
it than code. We had an internal instance of GitLab and I tracked all of my
work on there. So, as I planned and worked on new features, or went on bug
hunts, I'd document the process in the issue tracker. As much as possible
I'd be really verbose about the process. Often I wouldn't just open an
issue, go work on it, and then mark it closed; as I worked through the issue
I'd add comment after comment under it, documenting my thinking, problems,
solutions, cite sources when looking something up, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process was an act in having a conversation with current or future
team members if they ever needed to look; with future me (really, that
helped more than once -- we all have those "that the &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt; was I thinking?"
moments); with any developer(s) who took over from me in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did all this as if I was broadcasting it in public &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg"&gt;on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep"&gt;on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It was in private, of course, but I
approached it as if it was in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were always three main reasons for this, I felt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountability. At any moment someone who I worked with could review what
   I was doing and why I was doing it; it was an invitation to anyone
   curious enough to talk with me about what I was building and how I was
   building it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuity of support for unplanned reasons. Life happens, sometimes you
   may, unplanned, never be available at work again. I never wanted to leave
   my employer in a position where picking up from such an event was a
   nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuity of support for planned reasons. It was possible, and it became
   inevitable, that I'd move on to something else. If that was to happen I
   wanted to be sure that whoever picked up after me would be able to do so
   without too much effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end item 3 seemed to really pay off. When it came time for me to hand
over my work to someone else, as I left, the process was really smooth and
trouble-free. I was able to point the developer at all the documentation and
source code, at all the issues, and invite them to read through it all and
then come back to me with questions. In terms of time actually spent talking
about the main system I was handing over I'd say that 4 years of work was
handed over with just a few hours of actual talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if it really paid off, of course. If they get really
stuck they do have an open invitation to ping me a question or two; I care
enough about what I designed and built that I want it to carry on being
useful for some time to come. But... I like to think that all of that
building in public, in private, will ensure that this is an invitation that
never needs to be called on. I like to think that, if something isn't clear,
they'll be able to check the code, the documentation and the issue history
and get to where they need to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Reading 2bit files (for fun) - the sequence</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/09/26/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-sequence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-26T15:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-26T15:57:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2020-09-26:/2020/09/26/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-sequence.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will cover the most important content of a 2bit file: the actual
sequence data itself. In &lt;a href="/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html"&gt;the first
post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about the format
of the file's header, and in &lt;a href="/2020/09/05/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-index.html"&gt;the second
post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about
the content of the file's index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point that's enough information to know what's in the file and where
to find it. In other words we know the list of sequences that live in the
file, and we know where each one is positioned within the file. So, assuming
we have our index in memory (ideally some sort of key/value store of
sequences names and their offsets in the file), given the name of a sequence
we can know where to go in the file to load up the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next obvious question is, what will we find when we get there? Actual
sequence data is stored like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Content&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Comments&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DNA size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Count of bases in the sequence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N block count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Count of N blocks in the sequence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N block starts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Array&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4*count bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Positions are zero-based&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N block sizes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Array&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4*count bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mask block count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Count of mask blocks in the sequence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mask block starts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Array&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4*count bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Positions are zero-based&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mask block sizes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Array&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4*count bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reserved&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Should always be 0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DNA data&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Byte Array&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;See below&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking the above down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;N blocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in passing in the first post: technically it's necessary to
encode 5 different characters for the bases in the sequences. As well as the
usual T, C, A and G, there also needs to be an N, which means the base is
unknown. Now, of course, you can't pack 5 states into two bits, so the 2bit
file format solves this by having an array of block positions and sizes
where any data in the actual DNA itself should be ignored and an &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; used in
its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mask blocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where my ignorance of bioinformatics shows, and where it's made very
obvious that I'm a software developer who likes to muck about with data and
data structures, but who doesn't always understand why they're used. I'm
actually not sure what purpose mask blocks serve in a 2bit file, but they
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; affect the output. If a base falls within a mask block the value that
is output should be a lower-case letter, rather then upper-case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The DNA data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the fun bit, where the real data is stored. This should be viewed
as a sequence of bytes, each of which contains 4 bases (except for the last
byte, of course, which might contain 1, 2 or 3 depending on the size of the
sequence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each byte should be viewed as an array of 2 bit values, with the values
mapping like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Binary&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Decimal&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Base&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given a byte whose value is &lt;code&gt;27&lt;/code&gt;, you're looking at the sequence &lt;code&gt;TCAG&lt;/code&gt;.
This is because &lt;code&gt;27&lt;/code&gt; in binary is &lt;code&gt;00011011&lt;/code&gt;, which breaks down as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;00&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;01&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you pull that data out of the byte will depend on the language and what
it makes available for bit-twiddling; those that don't have some form of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field"&gt;bit field&lt;/a&gt; will probably provide
the ability to bit shift and do a bitwise &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; (it's also likely that doing
bitwise operations is better than using bit fields anyway). In the version I
wrote in Emacs Lisp, it's simply a case of shifting the two bits I am
interested in over to the right of the byte and then performing a bitwise
and to get just its value. So, given an array called &lt;code&gt;2bit-bases&lt;/code&gt; whose
content is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defconst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit-bases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;T&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;C&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;G&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vector of the bases.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;Note that the positions of each base in the vector map to the 2bit decoding&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;for them.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this bit of code to pull out the individual bases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;aref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit-bases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;logand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mb"&gt;#b11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given code to unpack an individual byte, extracting all of the bases in a
sequence then becomes the act of having two loops, the outer loop being over
each byte in the file, the inner loop being over the positions within each
individual byte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pseudo-code, assuming that &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; hold the base locations
we're interested in and &lt;code&gt;dna_pos&lt;/code&gt; is the location in the file where the DNA
starts, the main loop for unpacking the data looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that some of the detail is left out in the above, especially the
business of loading up the relevant blocks; how that would be done will
depend on language and the approach to writing the code. The Emacs Lisp code
I've written has what I think is a fairly straightforward approach to it.
There's a similar approach in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-2bit"&gt;Common Lisp code I've
written&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. There are a few other details that differ
depending on how this is approached, the language used, and other
considerations; one body of 2bit reader code that I've written attempts to
optimise how it does things as much as possible because it's capable of
reading the data locally or via ranged HTTP GETs from a web server; the
Common Lisp version I wrote still needs some work because I was having fun
getting back into Common Lisp; the Emacs Lisp version needs to try and keep
data as small as possible because it's working with buffers, not direct file
access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got to know the format of 2bit files a fair bit, I'm adding this to
my list of "fun to do a version of" problems when getting to know a new
language, or even dabbling in a language I know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Bioinformatics"></category></entry><entry><title>Reading 2bit files (for fun) - the index</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/09/05/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-index.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-05T10:59:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-05T10:59:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2020-09-05:/2020/09/05/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-index.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in &lt;a href="/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html"&gt;the first
post&lt;/a&gt;, once you've read in the
header data for a 2bit file, the next step is to read the index. This is an
index into all the different sequences held in the file. Reading the index
itself is fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index comes right after the header -- so it starts on the 17th byte of
the file. Each entry in the index contains three items of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Content&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Comments&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name length&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How many bytes long the name is&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;String&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Varies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Length given by previous field&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Offset&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Location in the file of the sequence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in some sort of pseudo-code, you'd read in the index as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;seq_count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;seq_count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;comes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;read_bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;read_bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;read_bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, as mentioned in the &lt;a href="/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html"&gt;first
post&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; will need to
be byte-swapped if the file is in an endian form other than the machine
you're running your code on. How you'd go about this will, of course, vary
from language to language, but the main idea is always going to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fairly striking downside to this approach though: reading data can
often be an expensive (in terms of time) operation -- this is especially
true if the data is coming in from a remote machine, perhaps even one that's
being accessed over the Internet. As such, it's best if you can make as few
"trips" to the file as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the best thing to do is to read the whole index into
memory in one go and then process it from there -- the idea being that
that's just one trip to the data source. The problem here, however, is that
there's nothing in the header or the index that tells you how large the
index actually is. What you can do though is work on the worst case scenario
(assuming memory will allow). The worst case is fairly easy to handle: it's
going to be 1 byte for the name length, plus 255 bytes for the name (the
longest possible name), plus 4 bytes for the offset; multiply all that by
the number of sequences in the index and you have the worst-case buffer
size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading this data in you might also want to ensure you're not going to
run off the end of the file (perhaps the names are all quite small and so
are the sequences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been working on &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/2bit.el"&gt;a package for Emacs that can read data from
2bit files&lt;/a&gt;, so here's the core code for
reading in the index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit--read-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Read the sequence index from SOURCE.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;As a side effect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;`2bit-data-pos&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; of SOURCE will move.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cl-loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; The index will be a hash of sequence names, with the values being the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; offsets within the file.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;make-hash-table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;:test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#&amp;#39;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; We could read each name/value pair one by one, but because we&amp;#39;re doing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; this within Emacs, which means making a temp buffer for every read,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; that could get pretty expensive pretty fast. So instead we&amp;#39;ll read the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; index data in in one go. However, there is no easy-to-calculate size&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; for the index. The best we can do is calculate the worst case size. So&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; let&amp;#39;s do that. The worst case size is the maximum size of the name of&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; a sequence (255), plus the size of the byte that tells us the name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; (1), plus the size of the word that is the offset in the file (4).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit--read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit-data-sequence-count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; For every sequence in the file...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit-data-sequence-count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Calculate the position within the buffer for this loop around. Note&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; that the skip is the last position plus 1 for the size byte plus the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; size plus the length of the offset word.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Get the length of the name of the sequence.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;aref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Pull out the offset.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;2bit--word-from-bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Collect the offset into the hash.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;gethash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Once we&amp;#39;re all done.... return the index.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code does what I mention above: it grabs enough data into a buffer in
one go that I'll have the whole index in memory to pull apart, and then I
work with the in-memory copy. The index is added to a hashing dictionary.
Note that, in this case, I don't actually do the test for running off the
end of the file because at the heart of the file reading code is
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Reading-from-Files.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;insert-file-contents-literally&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and it doesn't error if you request too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done you'll have a list of all the sequences in the file. The next
part, which will come in &lt;a href="/2020/09/26/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-sequence.html"&gt;the next
post&lt;/a&gt;,
is the properly tricky part: the decoding of the sequence data itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Bioinformatics"></category></entry><entry><title>Reading 2bit files (for fun)</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-30T15:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-30T15:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2020-08-30:/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written a bit before about the value of having simple but interesting
"problems", that you know the solution to, as &lt;a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html"&gt;a way of exercising yourself
in a new environment&lt;/a&gt;. Recently I've
added another to the list I already have, and I used it as an excuse to get
back into writing &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-2bit"&gt;some Common
Lisp&lt;/a&gt;; and then went on to use it
as a reason to write &lt;a href="(https://elisp.dev/)"&gt;yet another&lt;/a&gt; package &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/2bit.el"&gt;for
Emacs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gone through the process of writing code to handle 2bit files twice
in about a month, and in two very similar but slightly different languages,
I thought it might be interesting for me to then use it to exercise my
ability to write blog posts (something I always struggle with -- I find
writing &lt;em&gt;very hard&lt;/em&gt; on a number of levels) and especially posts that explain
a particular problem and how I implemented code relating to that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, because the initial version of this post rambled on a bit too much and
I lost the ability to finish it, I'm starting again and will be breaking it
up a number of posts spanning a number of days -- perhaps even weeks -- so
that I don't feel too overwhelmed by the process of writing it. I will, of
course, make sure every post links to the other posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I go on, I'll make the important point that everything here is
written from the perspective of a software developer who happens to work as
part of a bioinformatics team; I don't do bioinformatics, I don't claim to
understand it, I just happen to sit with (well, used to sit with them --
hopefully we'll all make it back to the office one day!) and work with them,
and develop software that supports their work. Anything you see in any of
the posts that's wrong about that subject: that's just my ignorance being
shown through the lens of a software developer (all corrections are
welcome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all those disclaimers aside, I'm going to go on a slow wander
through what a 2bit file is, how you'd go about reading it, and related
issues. This isn't designed as a tutorial or anything like that, this is
simply me taking what I've learnt and writing it down. Perhaps someone else
will benefit one day, but the purpose is to simply enjoy cementing it in my
own mind and to enjoy the process of putting it all in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is a "2bit file"?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's this new "problem" I've added to my list? It's code to read
sequence data from &lt;a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7"&gt;2bit format
files&lt;/a&gt;. For anyone who
doesn't know (&lt;em&gt;bioinformatics people look away now; a software developer is
going to explain one of your file formats&lt;/em&gt;), this is a file format that is
intended to hold sequences in an efficient way. As I'm sure you know,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; is made up of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase"&gt;4
bases&lt;/a&gt;, represented by the letters
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine"&gt;&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine"&gt;&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"&gt;&lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So, in the simplest case, we
could just represent a genome using those four letters. Simple enough,
right? Nice big text file with just those 4 letters in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, something like the human genome is around &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome#Molecular_organization_and_gene_content"&gt;3 billion bases in
length&lt;/a&gt;.
That'd make for a petty big file to have to store and move around. So why
not compress it down a bit? That's where the 2bit format comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this problem I'm sure most developers would quickly notice that, given
4 different characters, you only need 2 bits to actually hold them all (two
bits gets us &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;, so four different states). This
means with a little bit of coding you can store 4 bases in a single byte.
Just like that you've pretty much squished the whole thing down to 1/4 of
the original size. And that's more or less what the 2bit format does. If you
take a look at &lt;a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/"&gt;the actual data for the human
genome&lt;/a&gt; you'll see
that &lt;code&gt;hg38.2bit&lt;/code&gt; is roughly 1/4 of 3 billion bytes, ish, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wrinkle, however. There are parts of a genome where you might not
know what base is there. Generally &lt;a href="https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html"&gt;an &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; is used for
that&lt;/a&gt;. So, actually, we want
to be able to store 5 different characters. But 5 isn't going to go into 2
bits... Damn! Well, it's okay, 2bit has a solution to that too, and I'll
cover that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How is a 2bit file formatted?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from &lt;a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7"&gt;the format information available
online&lt;/a&gt;, a 2bit file is
a binary file format that is split into 3 key parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fixed size header with some key information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An index into the rest of the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series of records that contain actual sequence information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first post I'll cover the details of the header. Subsequent posts
will cover the index and the actual sequence data records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The header&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The header of a 2bit file is fixed in size and contains some key
information. It can be broken down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Content&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Comments&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Signature&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;See below for endian issues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Version&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Always 0.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sequence count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reserved&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Always ignored.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signature value is used to test if what you're looking at is a 2bit
file, but also tells you some vital information about how to read the file
-- see below for more on that. The version value is always &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; -- as such
another useful test would be to error out if you get a valid signature but
get a version other than &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. The sequence count is, as you'd guess, the
number of sequences that are held within the file -- this is important when
loading in the index of the file (more on that in the next post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The signature, big and little endianness, and byte swapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The header mentioned above comprises of 4 32-bit word values. The very first
word is important to how you read the rest of the file. This is the
&lt;code&gt;signature&lt;/code&gt; for the 2bit file and it should always be &lt;code&gt;0x1A412743&lt;/code&gt;. And this
is where it gets interesting and fun right away. The 2bit file format allows
for the fact that the file can be built in either &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness"&gt;a little-endian or a
big-endian machine&lt;/a&gt;, and the
32-bit word values can be binary-written to the file in the local
architecture's byte order. The effect of this is that, from reading the very
first value in the file, you need to decide if every other numeric value you
read needs to be byte-swapped in some way. The early logic being (in no
particular language) something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x1A412743&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;must_swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;byte_swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x1A412743&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;must_swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t a valid 2bit file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, to read the rest of the file you will need a function that
byte-swaps a 32bit numeric value, and a flag of some sort to mark that you
need to do this every time you read such a value. Of course, depending on
your language of choice, you could do it in a number of different ways. In a
language like JavaScript or Scheme, where you can easily throw around
functions, I'd probably just assign the appropriate 32bit-word-reading
function to a global function name and call that regardless throughout the
rest of the code. In other languages I'd probably just check the flag each
time and call the swapping function if needed. In something like Python I'd
likely just use the signature to decide on which format to pass to
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/struct.html#struct.unpack"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct.unpack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
For example, some variation on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Assuming that &amp;#39;header&amp;#39; is the whole header of the file read as a binary buffer.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;word_fmt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_fmt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;I&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;I&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unpack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x1A412743&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;word_fmt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_fmt&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;word_fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t a 2bit file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the Python approach sort of hides the important detail here. With it
we'd simply use &lt;code&gt;struct.unpack&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/struct.html#byte-order-size-and-alignment"&gt;ability to handle different byte orders
&lt;/a&gt;
and not worry about the detail. Which isn't fun, right? So how might code to
byte-swap a 32bit value look?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you've got the value as an actual numeric integer, it can be as
simple as using a bit of bitwise anding and shifting. Here's the basic code
I wrote in Common Lisp, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;swap-long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Swap the endianness of a long integer VALUE.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;logior&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;logand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#xff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;logand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#xff00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;logand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#xff0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;logand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#xff000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript might be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;swapLong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xff00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xff0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xff000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and other variations on that theme in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Up next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/2020/09/05/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-index.html"&gt;the next post&lt;/a&gt;
I'll write about how the sequence index is stored and how to load it,
including some considerations about how to make the loading as efficient as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Bioinformatics"></category></entry><entry><title>When the man page fibs</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/07/10/when-the-man-page-fibs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-10T20:58:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-10T20:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2020-07-10:/2020/07/10/when-the-man-page-fibs.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week something in my development environment, relating to
&lt;a href="https://brew.sh/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, Python,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"&gt;pipenv&lt;/a&gt;, got updated and broke a handful
of repositories. Not in a way that I couldn't recover from, just in a way
that was annoying, got in the way of my workflow, and needed attention.
&lt;em&gt;(note to self: how I set up for Python/Django development on a machine
might be a good post in the future)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was sure what the fix was (pretty much: nuke the virtual environment
and recreate it with &lt;code&gt;pipenv&lt;/code&gt;, being very explicit about the version of
Python to use) the next step was to figure out how many repositories were
affected; not all were and there wasn't an obvious pattern to it. What was
obvious was that the problem came down to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;.venv&lt;/code&gt; directory
pointing to a binary that didn't exist any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png" src="/attachments/2020/07/10/Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... tracking down problematic repositories would be simple enough, just
look for every instance of &lt;code&gt;.venv/bin/python&lt;/code&gt; and be sure it points to
something rather than nothing; if it points to nothing I need to remake the
virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly knocked up a script that was based around looking over the results
of a &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, and initially decided to use &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; to perform the test on
&lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. It seemed to make sense, as I wrote the script I checked the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;
page for &lt;code&gt;file(1)&lt;/code&gt; on macOS and sure enough, this exists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-E On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; dereferences links by default, that should get me an error
for a broken link, right? Bit hacky I guess, but it was the first thing that
came to mind for a quick bit of scripting and would do the trick. Only...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;file&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-E&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;does-not-exist
file:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;invalid&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;option&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;E
Usage:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;file&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;bcCdEhikLlNnprsvzZ0&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-e&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;test&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;namefile&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-F&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;separator&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;magicfiles&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-M&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;magicfiles&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;file...
&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;file&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-C&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;magicfiles
Try&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;file&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--help&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;more&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;information.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"&gt;Wat&lt;/a&gt;?!? But it's right there! It says so in the manual! &lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; is documented right in the manual page! And yet it's not in the valid switch list as put out by the command, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it's an &lt;code&gt;invalid option&lt;/code&gt;. The hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I go back and look at the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; page again and then I notice it isn't in
the list of switches in the synopsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS&lt;br&gt;
    file [-bcdDhiIkLnNprsvz] [--extension] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] [-P name=value] [-M magicfiles] file&lt;br&gt;
    file -C [-m magicfiles]&lt;br&gt;
    file [--help]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then did the obvious tests. Did I have &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; aliased in some way? No. Was
some other thing that works and acts like &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; in my path? No. Was I
absolutely 100% using &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/file&lt;/code&gt;? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short: it seems the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; page for &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;, on macOS, fibs about
what switches it supports; it says that &lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; is a valid option, but it's not
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's even odder is the man page says it documents v5.04 of the command,
but &lt;code&gt;--version&lt;/code&gt; reports v5.37. Meanwhile, if I check on a GNU/Linux box I
have access to, it does support &lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt;, reports it in the switches, documents
it in the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; page (in both the synopsis and in the main body of the page)
and it is v5.25 (and so is its man page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was something like 20 minutes lost to a very small problem, for
which there was no real solution, but was time that had to be spent to get
to the bottom of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I went with what I probably should have gone with in the first
place: &lt;code&gt;stat -L&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;find&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-name&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.venv&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;!&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stat&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-L&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/bin/python&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/null&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;dirname&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I have that script in my &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, ready for the next time

unsurprisingly it's bubbled up again recently: the business of swapping the
name of the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch in &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; out for something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's one of those jobs that's simultaneously simple and also
laborious, I kept putting it off. Changing up the local configuration so
that &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever name you prefer) is used "out of the box" &lt;a href="https://leigh.net.au/writing/git-init-main/"&gt;is
simple enough&lt;/a&gt;; the laborious
part is updating all of the repositories that live in the "forge of choice".
In my case, &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep"&gt;over on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, I have &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories"&gt;getting on
for 200 repositories&lt;/a&gt; -- 142 of
which are public (as of the time of writing). At work we use
&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; as our internal forge and I've got a
non-trivial number of repositories on there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious first step to tackling this is to knock up a little tool to help
find the repos that still need swapping. That was &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/git-archaic"&gt;simple
enough&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Quick and dirty tool to find repositories that still make use of a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; branch. Helps with tracking down the ones that need&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# updating/improving.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;repo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;find&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-name&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.git&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;dirname&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;branch&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;master&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/null&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;dirname&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;### git-archaic ends here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not meant to be clever, just something I can run when I'm in a "default
branch swapping" mood so find a repository or two to tackle. The idea being
that it uses &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to pull out any instance of &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; in or below the
current directory, changes to it (inside a sub-process to ensure the &lt;code&gt;PWD&lt;/code&gt;
gets put back after the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; that happens, before the next iteration of the
loop), gets a list of the branches and, if &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; is one of them, prints
the directory name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this, I can now slowly work through my more active repositories and
make the swap -- the idea being that if I currently have them cloned down to
my machine, they're obviously some level of "active". At some point I
imagine I could get more clever and use the APIs of the forges to look at
all the repositories I own; that's another job for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives me enough to be going on with. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>A second attempt to learn Swift</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/06/21/a-second-attempt-to-learn-swift.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-21T14:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-21T14:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2020-06-21:/2020/06/21/a-second-attempt-to-learn-swift.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's five years ago this month that I bought myself my first macOS (then OS
X) device. After many years of having a Windows machine as my daily driver,
which was also my work machine (I worked from home), I decided it was high
time that I returned to having a Unix-a-like system on my desk too. For a
decade or so, starting in the later-90s, I'd had a GNU/Linux desktop. I
still had a Windows desktop (until a couple of years ago most of my work was
on DOS and Windows), but thanks to the wonders of a KVM, and later an X
server that ran on Windows, my personal hacking was done on a GNU/Linux
desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as things moved around, priorities changed, as life moved on, the
GNU/Linux boxes got retired and never quite replaced. Eventually, in 2015, I
found myself with the means and desire to recover that sort of setup. Long
story short, after a lot of reading up and weighing up options I decided
that the best option for a desktop Unix was... an iMac!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved it. Sure, &lt;a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html"&gt;there were lots of little things on the surface that were
different or annoying or just plain not as cool as the Mac fans would tell
you&lt;/a&gt;,
but under the hood I found what I needed: a Unix CLI with all the things I
knew well. And, of course, it ran GNU Emacs just fine; that was the really
important thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much right away I decided that it might be fun to learn the tools
necessary to develop native Mac apps, and perhaps even iOS apps. I
downloaded XCode, bought a book, and started working through it. Having got
that book, I decided it might be interesting to own an iOS device too. So,
sort of needing an MP3 player, and having no wish to get an iPhone, &lt;a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html"&gt;I got
myself an iPod
Touch&lt;/a&gt;. So I
was all set to devour the Swift book, write some stuff for OS X, create an
iOS app or two, and... life happened. Stuff cropped up that distracted me
from taking that further and I never really returned to working through the
book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now and that initial iMac and iPod purchase spiralled a wee
bit. Next after the iPod was an iPad Mini, when my Nexus 7 was starting to
show its age and it was obvious that Google wasn't going to produce any more
good Android tablets. Then, when I needed a very portable Unix-a-like
machine for trips between where I was living and Edinburgh, &lt;a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html"&gt;I got myself a
MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;.
Since then the iPod Touch has been replaced once, as has the iPad Mini. I
now also own an iPad and a MacBook Pro. Unless Apple screw up and turn Macs
into something unusable for developers (there are rumours), I imagine I'll
be using Apple devices for some time to come now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, last month, having finally got frustrated with where Google were
going with Android and the Pixel series, I jumped ship to the iPhone 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of right now I'm in a situation where I'm all about the Apple ecosystem
regarding hardware and operating systems (including for my work machine),
all of which is there to support my heavy use of the Google ecosystem
(actually, the one bit of Google hardware I still lean on heavily is the
Google Home -- I have 3 around my home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... given all of that, I thought it was time to look at returning to
learning Swift, with a view to writing some native macOS and i(Pad)OS stuff.
I soon realised that the book I'd bought back in 2015 was rather out of
date. It covers Swift 1.2 -- &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Version_history"&gt;we're now up to
5.2&lt;/a&gt;!
Given this, and given I've forgotten pretty much everything I'd read at the
time, I decided I should start again from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I've started reading my way though &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ios-13-programming/9781492074526/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS Programming
Fundamentals with
Swift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
While this obviously has an emphasis on iOS, I'm already finding that the
first part of the book is a really great introduction to the Swift language
in general. The pace seems just right, and the way topics are grouped makes
it easy enough for me to skip over what's obvious (I don't need to know what
objected-oriented programming is, and what the difference between a class
and an object is, etc) and read up on the detail of this particular language
when it comes to general concepts I know (knowing the differences between a
class, struct and enum in the language is important, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've yet to write a line of code, but I'm fine with that. The book is
spending a lot of time introducing the language before encouraging you to
fire up XCode, and I'm okay with that. I'm never a fan of being asked to
write out code that I can't properly follow -- that just makes stuff look
like magic when it's far more educational to know what's going on. What I am
finding is I'm making lots of notes that are either &lt;em&gt;"oh, yeah, this is
cool, I like this idea!"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"WTF are you kidding me?!?"&lt;/em&gt;. Which is really
nice -- it's always great to learn a new language that's a bit different
from what you normally use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan then, over the next few weeks, it to keep at this and hopefully
document my journey. I think I'd like to write a short series of TIL-type
posts; nothing too long, just some new thing I read or discovered and my
reaction to it. So, if you happen to follow this blog, I apologise in
advance for any Swift-spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been warned. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Swift"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Where I live and work</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2020/01/11/where-i-live-and-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-11T14:17:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-11T14:17:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2020-01-11:/2020/01/11/where-i-live-and-work.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise that I spend a lot of time in Emacs. Especially when I'm
developing software, either for work or for personal fun, most of my time is
time spent in Emacs. While I do obviously flit over to Chrome, and mostly do
my CLI stuff in &lt;a href="https://iterm2.com/"&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; (I really like
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html"&gt;eshell&lt;/a&gt;
but it just can't replace a good terminal for me), I spend a lot of time
looking at Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what my Emacs looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 13.49.04.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 13.49.04.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key elements for me are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Light background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I've never really got on with when it comes to code editing is
dark themes and dark backgrounds. I find it too much of an eye strain.
Oddly, I tend to prefer dark themes everywhere else, but not when it comes
to working in Emacs. The theme I use is &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/init-style.el#L12-L13"&gt;the built-in adwaita
theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Less boring mode line&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make use of &lt;a href="https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline"&gt;powerline&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b9a3df42f0708eabc31a6176d69a67bbdf31a087/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L386-L399"&gt;make the mode line a bit less
boring-looking&lt;/a&gt;.
While the colour scheme is such that it's kept in line with the light look,
the style is nice in that it sort of matches the style of prompt I use in my
shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.05.39.png" src="/attachments/2020/01/11/Screenshot 2020-01-11 at 14.05.39.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Full screen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always run Emacs as a full-screen application, then splitting it into
different tiled windows using its own internal window handling. This is
something I've done from way back when I got started with my first GNU/Linux
desktop machine, and still like to do on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el"&gt;run Emacs as a server&lt;/a&gt; and
then use &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/e"&gt;a little wrapper around &lt;code&gt;emacsclient&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Emacs session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Comfortable eshell when I need it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I say above that I generally don't use &lt;code&gt;eshell&lt;/code&gt;, preferring to use
a full-featured terminal application, in combination with
&lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, I do sometimes dip into eshell for quick
things. So of course I have that configured to feel comfortable too.&lt;/p&gt;

weeks, the subject of &lt;em&gt;"how do I progress in leaning to program?"&lt;/em&gt; has
cropped up. For me, I think the approaches and solutions tend to be the same
for when I want to get my head around a new language: read good examples of
idiomatic code, read other related materials, find a problem you care about
and implement a solution (ideally something you'll directly benefit from, or
at least others may benefit from). Hence the &lt;a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html"&gt;5x5 puzzle and Norton Guide
reader projects I mentioned in my previous
post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone has problems that they need solving in a way that
would work for this approach. So another approach I've recommended in the
past is to go looking on somewhere like GitHub and find projects that
promote "low-hanging fruit" issues in a way that's designed to be friendly
for those who are new to development, new to contributing or new to the
problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for examples of this yesterday I stumbled on &lt;a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awesome for
Beginners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This looks
like a great list and one I'm going to keep &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep/"&gt;bookmarked for future
reference&lt;/a&gt;. Now, this particular list does
seem to have an emphasis on &lt;a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/issues/215"&gt;pulling in people who are new to contributing
to a project&lt;/a&gt;
rather than new to development, but it does strike me as a good place to
start looking no matter where you're coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I'm going to start having a wander around that list. It's always nice
to contribute and I feel there's real personal benefit in actively solving a
problem that someone else has and welcomes help with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="Coding"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry><entry><title>gh.fish -- Quickly visit a repo's forge</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/10/20/fg-fish.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-20T13:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-20T13:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2019-10-20:/2019/10/20/fg-fish.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These days &lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; is my shell of choice. I started
out with &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; back in the 1990s, went
through a bit of a
&lt;a href="https://www.zsh.org/"&gt;zsh&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://ohmyz.sh/"&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt; phase, but
earlier this year finally settled on fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I might write a post about my fish config, and why fish works
well for me. But that's an idea for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I thought I'd share a little snippet of code that can come in
handy now and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I find myself inside a git repo, in the shell, and I want to get
to the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;" for
that repo. This is most often either on &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or in
a &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/"&gt;company-local installation of GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.
To get there quickly I wrote
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/davep/3bac3b30e45a3560c265150e609219db"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gh.fish&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;##############################################################################&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Attempt go visit the origin hub for the current repo.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Visit the repo in its origin hub&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Check that there is some sort of origin.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# If we didn&amp;#39;t get anything...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;$origin&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# ...complain and exit.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;This doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be a git repo with an origin&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Open in the browser.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;$origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;### gh.fish ends here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is pretty simple: I see if the repo has an origin of some
description and, if it has, I &lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#string"&gt;slice and dice
it&lt;/a&gt; into something
that looks like the URL you'd expect to find for a GitHub or GitLab repo.
Finally I use
&lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#open"&gt;&lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to open the
URL in the environment's browser of choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="fish"></category><category term="git"></category></entry></feed>
