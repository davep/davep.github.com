my ideas list for weeks, months even, before I get around to it -- mostly
just due to not having the clear time to make a run at getting it going --
and then other times an idea can pop into my head and it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be created
there and then. &lt;strong&gt;Has&lt;/strong&gt; to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened yesterday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the tool I built is something I'd thought of before (back around
November last year I think) it hadn't even made it to my &lt;em&gt;"list of stuff I
should make"&lt;/em&gt; that I keep in Apple Reminders; not sure why really. But then
yesterday evening a question cropped up on the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr"&gt;Textual Discord
server&lt;/a&gt; that related to the subject and I was
reminded of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject being: &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/"&gt;Textual DOM
queries&lt;/a&gt;. I like to think that
DOM queries in Textual are pretty easy to do, and well-explained in the
docs, but it's fair to admit that they need a bit of practice first, just
like any powerful tool. So I was reminded that I'd wanted to write a sandbox
application, that would have a practice DOM inside it, an input field to
type in a query, and a way of displaying the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-query-sandbox"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-sandbox-query&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Textual Query Sandbox" src="/attachments/2023/09/01/tqs.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this very first version (which was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; quickly put together -- it
was something like 15 minutes to write the main code and then probably 45
minutes tweaking styles, adding all the admin stuff to allow &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-query-sandbox/"&gt;deployment to
PyPi&lt;/a&gt; and writing the
README) there's an &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/input/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
a display of a group of nested containers with different IDs and classes,
and then a &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/pretty/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pretty&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; widget
at the bottom to show the
&lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/queries/#query-objects"&gt;&lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this looks like it might be useful to you, it can be installed
using either &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; or (ideally) &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;textual-query-sandbox
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then you can run it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tqs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At which point load up the Textual query docs, type queries into the input
field, hit enter and see what gets highlighted and which widgets end up in
the result set at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I say: this was a quick hack yesterday evening, I think there's a lot
more can go into this. For one thing I think a more interesting practice DOM
would be a good idea, with a good mix of widgets; another thing could be
having a collection of different DOM playgrounds that can be switched
between (a &lt;code&gt;TabbedContent&lt;/code&gt; of different playgrounds could be fun here); this
could even be taken further such that the user can create their own
playground DOM to practice against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually it would be neat if this could be turned into a library that can
be included in a Textual application, as a development-time debug tool, so
that on-the-fly test queries can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, it's started, it's under way, and I think the current
version probably covers 90% of the use cases for something like this; making
for a really quick and easy tool to double-check how to query something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="PyPi"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="coding"></category><category term="Textual"></category></entry><entry><title>Mythos: Ragnarok (plus Oppenheimer)</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/27/mythos-ragnarok.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-27T10:55:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-27T10:55:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-27:/2023/08/27/mythos-ragnarok.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And I'm done! While it did only turn out to be one a week, &lt;a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html"&gt;I pulled it
off&lt;/a&gt;, I managed to make it to at
least one Fringe show per week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View inside the Roxy" src="/attachments/2023/08/27/IMG_2834.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a full, busy, and hugely enjoyable day. While it could have
just been a dash into town to see the show and back home again, in
conjunction with &lt;a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle"&gt;MariÃ«lle&lt;/a&gt; (who &lt;a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html"&gt;first
introduced me to the Mythos show&lt;/a&gt;)
we arranged to go watch Oppenheimer first (amazing, easily the fastest any
combined 3 hours have passed for me -- I'm not even going to try and write
up anything about this, other than I was utterly enthralled by the movie
from start to end), grab some dinner, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; go and see &lt;em&gt;Mythos: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a wee bit of shopping thrown in along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned before, I first saw Ragnarok last year. Then they were in
a fairly small venue, with a pretty full crowd. At the end they talked about
how the first night they'd played the audience had been a single person;
over the nights of the run it had slowly grown, and by the end of the run
(we went on the last night) it was getting properly busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year they were in a &lt;a href="https://assemblyfestival.com/venues/61_assembly-roxy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; bigger
place&lt;/a&gt;, with a lot
more seating, and the house was full. This did make it feel a little less
intimate than last year, and also last year we were sat all around the
stage, which worked well for the performance; this time around it was a more
traditional stage at the front, seating all on one side thing. I was really
pleased for them that they were in a much bigger place, but I did miss the
layout from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the show itself... just as fantastic. There seemed to have been some
tweaks and changes to how the story was done over what I remember from last
year, but mainly it was the same. The energy in the performance was
incredible, and the comedy was spot on, with a lot of nods and winks to the
audience. This is the part that I think I enjoy most: they know what they
have, they know what they're doing, they know what they have on offer. It's
a high-energy play performed by stunt people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VltdZJNLV68?si=bvN4UrdzyoLgFCUg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this there's one last show, I believe, tonight; so the chances of
anyone reading this and getting to see it are very remote. But if they're
back next year, and you're reading this near then and wondering about Fringe
shows, do it! Really, do it. You won't regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be going again. No question.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="Fringe"></category><category term="wrestling"></category><category term="movie"></category></entry><entry><title>Seen by davep broke (again)</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/20/seen-by-davep-broke-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-20T09:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-20T09:25:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-20:/2023/08/20/seen-by-davep-broke-again.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Almost &lt;a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html"&gt;seven years ago&lt;/a&gt; I took
up maintaining an ad-hoc photoblog again. I say again because I'd had one
once before. I'd kicked that off back in the late 200xs, with my little HTC
Magic, and hosted it on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous"&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually Posterous
was shut down, mostly because the company (or at least the team behind it))
had been &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424063619/http://blog.posterous.com/big-news"&gt;bought up by
Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.
When kicking off the blog this time I decided on a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd host it on Blogger.com; it had been around for long enough, and of
  course &lt;a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/"&gt;Google could be trusted to keep something that big up and running
  for good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd keep multiple backup copies of the images and file them in useful ways
  (I keep copies in Google Photos, on Google Drive, on iCloud and locally).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As much as possible I'd automate the process of doing some, if not all of
  this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, while it was kind of old as an idea, this felt very much like
one of those things that was perfect to do in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"&gt;Web
2.0&lt;/a&gt; way; the good old reliable
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)"&gt;mashable
web&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the plan became this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every post would be a tweet, posted to Twitter with a &lt;code&gt;#photoblog&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd use &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;ifttt&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on my tweets and when
  it saw one with that tag it would extract the image, make a post to
  Blogger, drop a copy into Google Drive, and do a couple of other things
  too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every week or so I'd do some manual checks to make sure everything is
  looking okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked. Mostly. It ran fine for a few years, with very few problems.
I'd take a photo, manipulate the heck out of it for the emotional effect I
was going for (that was the point of the blog; it was all about the messing
with the image), tweet it, and Web 2.0 magic would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the odd issue started to crop up. At one point Twitter made changes to
how images were stored, or something, and the ifttt recipe broke for a wee
while; then they changed the way that public posts could be seen (long
before the Musk-era bullshit) and that broke things again, and so on. I
forget the details but at every point I was able to nurse it back to life
and things carried on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, of course, it all fell apart when Musk took over Twitter and
massively ruined it, turning it into the steaming pile it is now&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I've
honestly lost track of which change broke what, and of course I also gave up
even trying to use Twitter (the drip, drip, drip of right-wing hate politics
got to a point where I could not find a way to make it work any more). So
that's when I decided to cut Twitter out altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had actually started a little earlier than that, when the whole API
fiasco kicked off. When that came in ifttt had to remove Twitter things from
its free tier; I was on the free tier. I was on the free tier only because I
didn't need anything the paid service offered. If Twitter had been "normal"
and this change had been made I'd have happily paid -- I don't mind paying
for things I find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, nope, given all the context, I bailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by that point I decided the easiest thing to do was to simply hand-add
posts to Blogger, and also along the way post to &lt;a href="https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/496199122963740964"&gt;a pixelfed account
instead&lt;/a&gt;,
reposting those posts from &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep"&gt;my Fosstodon
account&lt;/a&gt;. Not ideal, needing more manual
input, but also I was thinking that once I find a good flow I could probably
automate the whole thing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's the point I'd reached. Twitter was 100% out of the workflow,
there was a bit more manual intervention, but the &lt;a href="https://seenbydavep.blogspot.com/"&gt;primary location for the
photos&lt;/a&gt; was still getting updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then yesterday I noticed this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Broken images in my photoblog" src="/attachments/2023/08/20/borked-photos.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually quite know exactly what's going on here, and at this point
I really don't care. My working hypothesis is this: when ifttt added the
images to the Blogger posts, it was doing so in a way that it was using the
image hosted by Twitter. Because of this, either due to some change in the
Twitter API, or perhaps because I've locked down my Twitter account, the
images can't be served any more. That's my best guess anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really care to dig deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, this is another example of the long-growing rot of the dream of
Web 2.0. I'm not surprised; I'm not angry; I'm just disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I have all the images saved (see backup options above), so I can
go back and edit the posts and drop fresh copies of the images into them.
There's 100s of posts affected so this is going to take quite a while; I
mean, sure, I could probably do it in a day if I sat and did nothing else,
but I have other things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option would of course be to create a fresh blog using my own tools;
that would be simple enough. I have the images, they're all set with the
right date and time, recreating things would be fairly trivial (post titles
a slight problem but I could work around that); a tool like mkdocs or
Pelican plus some Python code to recreate the posts from the images would be
a fun couple of hours mucking about. But... I have a lot of posts on Blogger
and all the URLs are stable and still there many years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I could automate the "fixing" of the broken posts? I wonder what the
Blogger API is like to work with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: If you've read this and feel that what's &lt;/em&gt;really&lt;em&gt; needed is a "helpful"
comment that self-hosting is the solution; please sit on that and read the
above again (and, you know, look over the rest of this blog and the entirety
of my time and content on the Internet in general and the Web in particular,
going back to the mid-90s).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you are reading this and you're still maintaining a
Twitter account that you actively use, what the hell is wrong with you?
Multiply that lots if you have a blue tick.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

back&lt;/a&gt;, last night I went to see a
Fringe show that was a production of &lt;em&gt;The Little Shop of Horrors&lt;/em&gt;. Before
going I had no idea what to expect (in terms of how it would be done, not
what the content would be): I wasn't clear if it would be a really small
affair, or something on a bigger stage with reasonably high production
values (what can I say? It was LSoH, it was a Fringe show, it was booked
knowing nothing else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got there and got into the venue it was... small, oh so very small!
No real set to speak of. The cast who were about to kick off the performance
didn't really seem to have much of a costume going on. So, without
judgement, I settled down to expect the next 90 minutes or so to be... a
Fringe experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions were oh so wrong! While there was (for obvious reasons) a
lack of any real set, the effort that went into the performance really
worked and I absolutely enjoyed every single moment. Also, because it was a
production of the musical (which I haven't seen), rather than an adaption of
the movie (which I have), I got to experience a fresh ending (spoilers!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seats were uncomfortable. The room was down in the basement, with no
ventilation, and so was uncomfortably hot. Physically it wasn't a great
space to be. And yet I really wasn't wishing for it to be over. I think that
says a lot about the show itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think special mention has to be given to the Audrey II models, of which
there were three different sizes. Someone put some real effort into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, a fun night, topped and tailed with pre-show dinner and post-show
drinks with friends. I couldn't have asked for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I last-moment book anything else over the next week, &lt;a href="/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html"&gt;there's one
more show to go&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html"&gt;push to go
and see at least one show per week of the
Fringe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Sadly no photos. I wasn't sat in a great spot to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="Music"></category><category term="Gig"></category><category term="Fringe"></category></entry><entry><title>Mythos: Ragnarok booked</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-15T20:06:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-15T20:06:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-15:/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That's a third show booked!

hoped&lt;/a&gt;, I'm
going to manage at least one show a week for the Fringe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this one could be seen as a cheat, sorta, kinda. I've seen this show
before. But I liked it so much last year I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to see it again! The odd
thing about it was it's not something I would have gone for on my own, it's
technically not really my thing, but I got talked into it and I'm so glad I
was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a year back &lt;a href="https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle"&gt;MariÃ«lle&lt;/a&gt; told me about
this wrestling show at the Fringe and how she wanted to go but nobody else
was interested and I was all &lt;em&gt;"yebbut wrestling though?"&lt;/em&gt; and didn't think
much more about it. Eventually though, after some persuasion (I mean, an
hour or so at a show and some beers afterwards, how bad could it be
really?), I agreed to go. I expected to find it meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cast of Mythos: Ragnarok 2022" src="/attachments/2023/08/15/IMG_7612.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit was it so much fun! Like, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37r1CqMKLzM"&gt;seriously so much
fun&lt;/a&gt;. I'd never realised that
wrestling was the best way to tell the tales from Norse mythology; turns out
that wrestling is absolutely the best way to tell the tales from Norse
mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mythos-ragnarok"&gt;we're off back again this
year&lt;/a&gt;. All booked,
not this weekend, the weekend after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might even be a beer afterwards. Perhaps not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; so many as last
year though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="Fringe"></category><category term="wrestling"></category></entry><entry><title>Website: Miscellaneous Stuff moved</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/14/website-misc-stuff-moved.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-14T22:04:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-14T22:04:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-14:/2023/08/14/website-misc-stuff-moved.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This evening I've spent more time working on &lt;a href="/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html"&gt;the planned complete remake of
my personal website&lt;/a&gt;, in this case
"porting" over many of the files that made up the old "miscellaneous stuff"
section of the site. If I'm honest, most if not all of the things in there
are no longer relevant (like: who really needs a shell script to make
&lt;code&gt;gnuplot&lt;/code&gt; plots from files pulled off a 1990s-era Garmin handheld GPS
unit?), but I thought I'd keep them kicking around "just in case".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wee section I wasn't going to get rid of though was my scans of three
pages from a UK magazine called &lt;em&gt;Personal Computer News&lt;/em&gt;. These contain
&lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/misc/grid-bike/"&gt;Grid Bike&lt;/a&gt;; a game I wrote for the
VIC-20, all in BASIC, and got published. For my efforts I got a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;
cheque for Â£40! If that doesn't seem like much to you, trust me, to 1983 me
this was &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 16k RAM pack with the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, while trying to improve some of the links in the text, I
decided to see if there was now an archive online somewhere and, sure
enough, there is: &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews001-18Mar1983/"&gt;in the obvious
place&lt;/a&gt;.
This means that my web site isn't the only copy of my program on the net. If
you go to the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews041-21Dec1983/page/n9/mode/2up"&gt;December 21st 1983
edition&lt;/a&gt;
and turn to around page 84, there I am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I'm almost tempted to try and get an emulator up and running
and get the code going again. How much fun would it be to add a video to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson"&gt;my

bunch of new things that I'd added to PyPi, things mostly kicked off by an
early &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/"&gt;dog-fooding session we had at textual
HQ&lt;/a&gt;.
Since then I've been slowly doing my best to keep the applications up to
date with Textual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Unbored" src="/attachments/2023/08/13/unbored.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as possible we try and not make breaking changes with the framework,
but at the same time it is still 0.x software and there's still new ways of
doing things being designed so there's going to be the odd break in approach
now and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/unbored"&gt;Unbored&lt;/a&gt;, my kind of silly
self-populating TODO list application, has been sitting atop Textual 0.20.x
for a while now and earlier today I checked how it was getting in with
0.32.0 and... actually surprisingly okay. Not perfect, there were a couple
of things that had suffered from bitrot, but it wasn't crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I needed to change was the ability to focus a couple of
containers (they didn't used to receive focus by default, now they do so I
had to tell them not to again), and that was about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was in there I also updated the application so that I dropped the
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZsXGQQpFw"&gt;nifty little slide-in error dialog I'd
made&lt;/a&gt;, and instead embraced
&lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/07/17/textual-0300-adds-desktop-style-notifications/"&gt;the new Textual notification
system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the application itself is a bit silly, and likely of no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; use to
anyone, I feel it's a pretty good barometer application, helping me check
what the experience is like when it comes to maintaining a Textual
application and the needs to keep on top of changes to Textual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying, I hope, that really you should pin the Textual
dependency for your applications, and upgrade in a controlled and tested
way; for this though it's less crucial and is a good test of the state of
the ecosystem, and on the remote chance that anyone is using it, it'll be
helpful to me if it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; break and they yell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="PyPi"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="coding"></category><category term="Textual"></category></entry><entry><title>Website: Norton Guide information moved</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/13/website-norton-guide-information-moved.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-13T10:02:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-13T10:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-13:/2023/08/13/website-norton-guide-information-moved.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I've spent a wee bit of time tinkering with the configuration
of &lt;a href="/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html"&gt;the planned complete remake of my personal
website&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this I made an
effort to "port" over a section of the site. The choice for the first
section to move was easy enough: &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/"&gt;Norton
Guides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the parts of my old site, this is probably the most useful in terms
of &lt;em&gt;"contains information that isn't generally available out there on the
web elsewhere and some folk might find it useful"&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, at some point in
the past, someone edited the Wikipedia page for Norton Guides and linked to
mine as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So getting that one back up and running as soon as possible made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not added &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; bit of Norton Guide code to the main page, instead
just pulling over and tidying up what was there before. On the other hand,
just hacking on Markdown makes it all so much easier so I may expand on it a
bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really important part was moving over &lt;a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/file-format/"&gt;the file format
details&lt;/a&gt;. This, I feel, is
the information that people will be looking for, if anyone is ever looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, proper start made; there's content beyond the landing page. There's
still a lot to weed out and move over, and I think there's a lot of tweaking
and the like with the configuration to do too. But the ball is rolling now.
Ever time I get a spare hour and the desire to sit at my desk I can pick a
section, look it over, decide if it deserves to come over, and act on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, at this rate I might even end up with an actively-maintained website
again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Nick Harper at the Jazz Bar</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/12/nick-harper-at-the-jazz-bar.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-12T08:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-12T08:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-12:/2023/08/12/nick-harper-at-the-jazz-bar.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As mentioned &lt;a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html"&gt;about a week back&lt;/a&gt;,
my first show booked for this year's Edinburgh Fringe was to see &lt;a href="https://harperspace.com/home"&gt;Nick
Harper&lt;/a&gt;. It's been a long time since I've seen
him; far too long. As best as I can tell the last gig I made it to was in
2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen years. Shit's changed in that time, for me, for the world. O_o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first getting into town it was warm and crowded, with that fun "town is
doing festival shit" vibe that I like, so I went and grabbed an ice cream to
kill some time until the venue opened. I knew I was in the right spot when,
as I stood on Chambers Street, enjoying the cooldown, the man himself dashed
passed, guitar case in hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got into the venue I grabbed a drink and tried to find a seat; most
were taken; except for one right at the front and off to the side. So I
grabbed it. Moments later Nick himself came over to say hello to the folk
sat in this spot. We had a wee chat about how long it was since I'd last
seen him, nattered about general stuff, and he said very nice things about
my hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2682.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gig itself was fantastic. While I love his recorded work anyway, Nick's
always been one of those artists who I enjoy most live. He's got this way of
singing and playing guitar that fills whatever time he's got to play; never
once have I ever found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it's near
the end; or if I have it's because I'm worried it'll be over soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2684.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good number of the tracks he played I didn't recognise; at least two of
them I know are from a new album that's coming, and I have to admit that
when I do listen to his stuff it's the earlier works that tend to go into
heavy rotation (I think the last album of his I bought was &lt;em&gt;The Last
Guitar&lt;/em&gt;). But I loved everything I got to hear. I'll be diving back into
&lt;a href="https://harperspace.com/shop"&gt;his catalogue&lt;/a&gt; and also keeping an eye out
for the new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2689.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was only an hour for his slot, he did manage to get a couple of
old favourites of mine in; I was delighted when he launched into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQAebSpqVw"&gt;By My
Rocket Comes Fire&lt;/a&gt;, did a
wonderful &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH6TqeeM5ZY"&gt;She Rules My World&lt;/a&gt;,
and even squeezed in a quick &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yz7mQ_i6pg"&gt;Galaxy
Song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2705.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too quickly though, the hour was up. It was kind of fitting that many of
the songs he did have on the set list were all about time (on purpose, I'm
sure). I'm happy to say I got to say a quick thank you and goodbye and then
it was time for me to head out of town again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nick Harper" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/IMG_2701.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Nick brought back a lot of good memories, and reminded me that I need
to catch up on his more recent works. While most of his stuff doesn't seem
to be on Apple Music (what can I say, I'm very online these days when it
comes to music), I'm glad to see &lt;a href="https://nickharper.bandcamp.com/"&gt;he's got a full
Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll be paying that a visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope he swings back this way some time soon, not during the Fringe, and
with a proper long set. It's been too long since I got to enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTD03-3qgmg"&gt;him really
going for it and having a ton of
fun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="Music"></category><category term="Gig"></category><category term="Fringe"></category><category term="Nick Harper"></category></entry><entry><title>The HomePod fixed itself</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/12/the-homepod-fixed-itself.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-12T07:46:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-12T07:46:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-12:/2023/08/12/the-homepod-fixed-itself.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html#home-pod-stuck-installing"&gt;A couple of weeks
back&lt;/a&gt;
I mentioned home my main HomePod had got stuck installing 16.6 of the
software that runs it. This situation persisted for days after writing that
post and I kept promising myself that I was going to see if I could unstick
it by removing it from the Home, doing a factory reset and adding it back
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, during the week that followed, I never got round to that. You can
imagine what it's like: no time in the morning, and by the time I get home
in the evening I want to watch TV and use the HomePod as the speaker for the
Apple TV, I don't want to be doing tech support shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following weekend... yeah, I kinda forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, a couple of Saturdays on, it's early morning, I've had
breakfast and I'm having coffee and I think it's the perfect time to do
this. I hope the Home app my on iPad and... it's sorted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HomePod all good again" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 07.25.44.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, it looks like it somehow managed to unstick itself in the end. A
quick test of some of the issues I was seeing suggested there was still an
issue, for example asking for the temperature in the bedroom would still
result in a &lt;em&gt;"working on it"&lt;/em&gt; reply followed by it telling me it wasn't
responding. A quick reset seems to have fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it's good to know: if it happens again, it'll keep on working as the
speaker for my Apple TV, and it'll eventually sort itself out even if I
don't muck about with a hard reset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Apple"></category></entry><entry><title>The reboot begins</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-11T13:19:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-11T13:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-11:/2023/08/11/the-reboot-begins.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And I'm off! This morning I spent a good amount of time going through the
sources for the old version of &lt;a href="http://www.davep.org"&gt;&lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
removing everything that won't be needed any more, and also building up a
rough TODO list of things I may want to recreate as content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done, &lt;a href="/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html"&gt;as mentioned earlier
today&lt;/a&gt;, I started work on
building the site around Pelican. Pretty quickly though I started to feel
that that was going to be a bad choice. While Pelican felt like a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;
fit for this blog -- mainly because it seems to be very blog-oriented -- it
was feeling a bit clunky for a general website that would have a handful of
static pages at best; likely something I wouldn't be updating too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put it aside and went on with my morning, doing normal Friday domestic
stuff like the weekly supermarket shop. It was while I was out doing that
that I realised the obvious answer: use &lt;a href="https://textual.textualize.io/"&gt;what we use for the Textual
docs&lt;/a&gt; and what's been used for
&lt;a href="https://label.dev/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;label.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/"&gt;Material for
MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just spent about 40 minutes after lunch kicking that off and it was
really straightforward. Of course the result is horrifically cookie-cutter
in terms of its look -- such is the way that &lt;code&gt;mkdocs-material&lt;/code&gt; sites end up
looking out of the box -- but I don't much care about that; what's important
is that I've got a placeholder page in place, and I've quickly built a
framework for writing and publishing the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the plan: now that the welcome page is in place and there's
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on my domain that looks like a working website again I can start
to slowly drag in old content in a new format. Heck, if I'm careful I might
even be able to retain some of the old URLs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer-term plans might involve finally sorting out &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; support (yes,
even today, my site is &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;-only), and perhaps adding some sort of RSS
feed so there's a record of when changes are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that... hopefully that'll be about it and perhaps the website will
last another 22 years running on top of the same engine (actually that part
should be easier because the "engine" is now local and it generates a static
site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes who'll last longer, the site or me?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Admitting defeat on my website</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-11T08:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-11T08:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-11:/2023/08/11/admitting-defeat-on-my-website.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had &lt;code&gt;davep.org&lt;/code&gt; since very late 1999. Initially it started as a domain
used just for email; while I did have a website, around that time it was
still hosted on my then-ISPs hosting service, with a mirror on a friend's
web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so later I finally did a proper revamp of my website and finally
settled on &lt;code&gt;www.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; as the place to point people to. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;, when
I made that move, that's when I decided to write my own website engine in
php. It was fun. It worked. I didn't want to code backend stuff (I don't
think the backend vs frontend distinction was even a thing we were talking
about then) so hacking it together in an unholy mix of ruby to generate
various static files that live in the filesystem and then php to turn them
into actual HTML made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The earliest version of davep.org I can find" src="/attachments/2023/08/11/davep-org.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heavily maintained the site for many years; keeping the same engine,
tweaking the styles, adding features and content. I figure some time around
2013 or 2014 I probably stopped being quite so active in messing with it,
and then in the last 5 or 6 years I've pretty much neglected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neglect shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... php has changed. Quiet a lot. It's one of those languages I
used back in the day and pay no attention to. Then earlier this week I
noticed that there must have been an update on the host and huge parts of my
site broke, lots of content missing, pretty much useless and dead in the
water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did briefly think about breaking out the latest and greatest php locally,
setting things up to investigate what's going on, and seeing if I could
breathe some more life into it; but really what's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all these years I'm finally admitting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, on the home page, I've just got a placeholder saying that bitrot
finally ate my website and that I'm going to start again from scratch.
That's my plan: given that &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html"&gt;I had a good experience moving this blog over to
Pelican&lt;/a&gt; I
think I'm going to build a new &lt;code&gt;www.davep.org&lt;/code&gt; with Pelican. Where possible
I'll try and drag some of the old content over, but I'm also going to use
this opportunity to have a proper digital spring clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no planned timescale for this, but this morning I've spent an hour
or so over coffee, branching the repo for the site and pruning out all the
stuff I know I won't need and don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try and drop the odd update in here as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Coding"></category><category term="php"></category><category term="html"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Off to see Little Shop of Horrors</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-10T20:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-10T20:30:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-10:/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)"&gt;Little Shop of
Horrors&lt;/a&gt; for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Poser for Little Shop of Horrors" src="/attachments/2023/08/10/IMG_2652.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in &lt;a href="/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html"&gt;a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would&lt;/a&gt;, this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; how much there is on offer?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors"&gt;a performance of Little Shop of

entry&lt;/a&gt;, where I outlined a
weird problem I'd started having with syncing Obsidian via iCloud, I finally
decided to sit down and try and work out the exact flow of the problem.
Today, for example, I'd created an entry in two different vaults on my phone
while on the bus into work, and when I got to my desk the vault I use on my
work machine had updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I got home this evening, the vault for my personal stuff
hadn't updated on my home Mac Mini. I tried a few edits, in both vaults, on
the iPhone, and nothing came through to the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... before I started really diving into things I decided to &lt;em&gt;"turn it off
and on again"&lt;/em&gt; -- the iPhone that is -- and when it came back I ran up
Obsidian, which told me it wasn't allowed to access my iCloud drive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a moment to go into the settings to try and figure it out, didn't
find what I wanted right away, then got to thinking that perhaps some of the
phone's services were still spinning up, so I ran Obsidian up again (after
killing it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, this time, it saw my vaults. With both vaults open on my Mac I
made edits to open entries and &lt;strong&gt;the edits started to flow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yup, looks like it was a simple case of &lt;em&gt;"turn it off and on again"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Not that heavily, not to the extent some
people do, but just as a way to keep a daily journal of work-related things.
Each day at &lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/"&gt;Textual HQ&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/about-us/"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; finish off with a chat about how
our day has gone, stuff we're wondering about, etc, etc... So I don't lose
tack of what I've been up to I keep notes and Obsidian is how I do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really like about it is how I can have iPhone, iPad and
macOS versions on the go and have it all sync via iCloud. It generally works
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the last couple of days I've noted the oddest problem, and I've yet
to pin down the exact flow. But it seems to be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I create or edit a note on my iPhone, it doesn't turn up on my Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I create or edit a note on my Mac, it turns up on my iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I might have seen variations on that theme but I've not made
careful note -- normally I'm made aware of it when I'm trying to get
something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's super weird is this: on the iPhone, if I create a note, and then go
into the &lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt; app and look at the iCloud folders for Obsidian, the file
isn't there! It's there in Obsidian itself, I can move it about, edit it,
etc, etc... but it's not in the "vault" as seen from the &lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the last part that has be really puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get to the bottom of this I'll try and remember to write up what I
find. I suspect I'm going to need some proper clear time, without other
distractions, and experiment with all the edit and sync options and see what
works and what fails.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Obsidian"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="iCloud"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="Mac"></category></entry><entry><title>Off to see Nick Harper</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-07T21:56:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-07T21:56:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-07:/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Poster from likely the last time I saw Nick" src="/attachments/2023/08/07/2009-05-08-19-14-07.jpg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lived near Edinburgh for getting on well over 6 years now and, aside
form the odd show here and there, I've never really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; the Fringe. As
in, really dived in. Since moving up here my life situation didn't quite
allow for it and then the pandemic hit and... well, you can imagine. Every
year I've been up here I've managed one show, at least, but this year I want
to try and make myself get to a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one per week. Possibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might not happen, but I'm going to try. What can I say? I don't live &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;
Edinburgh, I'm not a big "be out amongst people" kind of person, and the
activation energy to get on a bus into town vs what I can do in my little
part of Scotland is a constant battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year I'm going to try my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening I've booked a ticket for an artist I've been a fan of since the
1990s: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harper"&gt;Nick Harper&lt;/a&gt;. I saw Nick
quite a few times in the 200xs (see the image above, I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; 2009 might be
the last time I saw him!) and then my going to gigs tailed off somewhat
(again, life stuff). So seeing that &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/5-nights-in-harperspace"&gt;he's playing here for a few
days&lt;/a&gt; was
something I could not ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend me can thank Monday me for committing him to doing something
kinda sociable. I'm sure he'll be mad at me most of the day it's happening,
but once it all kicks off and the music is flowing he'll be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, at this moment... I'm rather looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="Music"></category><category term="Gig"></category><category term="Fringe"></category><category term="Nick Harper"></category></entry><entry><title>HomePod Stuck Installing Update</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-29T07:56:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-29T07:56:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-29:/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have three HomePods. I have a Mini in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.
I then have one of the newer-gen "big" HomePods in the living room, which
amongst other things is the speaker for my Apple TV device (yeah, I'm kinda
Apple all over the place these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week there was an update to the software, updating to 16.6. The two
Minis updated just fine. The big one, however, days later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HomePod stuck installing the update" src="/attachments/2023/07/29/HomePodStuck.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been like this all the time since the update turned up. I've tried a
reboot from the Home app. I've tried pulling the plug and plugging it in
again. Nope. It just keeps sitting there like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... it's working (more or less) fine. It's still playing music.
It's still being the speaker for the Apple TV. It still answers most
questions and performs most commands (most of the commands I give it are to
add stuff to my Reminders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasion if I ask it questions about other devices in the apartment
(&lt;em&gt;"hey siri, what's the temperature in the bedroom?"&lt;/em&gt;) it'll do the
&lt;em&gt;"working on it"&lt;/em&gt; thing and then give up saying the thing wasn't responding.
That seems to be about the worst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having checked this online it looks like, annoyingly, the one option I have
left is to do a full reset, removing it from my Home, doing a factory reset,
and then setting it up again. I'm sure it's something that'll take 10
minutes or so; but it's an annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;

been via a comment on some article on the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news"&gt;orange
site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I stumbled on a really
handy bit of free (as in beer) software called &lt;a href="https://quiche.works/reader/"&gt;Quiche
Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really simple and I feel &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the sort of thing I need. Over the
years I've tried all sorts of "save to read later" tools and systems; be it
things like Pocket, or tools now built into the browser these days, even
adding URLs to &lt;a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt; (back
when I used that) or (these days) Apple Reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever quite stuck. Normally I'd end up slapping stuff to read into
these systems and then never reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiche Reader, so far, feels like the perfect approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quiche Reader in action" src="/attachments/2023/07/27/quiche-reader.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple: if I see something I want to read a bit later I save it
into the application (which will sync to my other devices via iCloud). Then,
when I go to Quiche Reader, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to read the article or delete it and
move on. This is sort of what I'd do anyway, saving stuff up for months on
end until one day I'd declare saved reading bankruptcy and then start the
whole cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can look at the saved article stack and I'm forced to either read the
thing, or be honest with myself that if I'm not gonna read it now, I'm
probably never going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does have a "pause" facility (or something like that, I forget the name)
where you can throw an article to the back of the queue; but even then that
means it'll keep popping back to the top again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll see how it goes; but so far I feel like this is the best &lt;em&gt;"I'll save
this to read later"&lt;/em&gt; tool I've found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I KNOW! But there's so few places left to aimlessly scroll on
the bus now!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

know that, starting January 1st that year, I set about losing weight. At the
time I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; overweight and wanted to get into some sort of healthy
state. By August that year I'd managed to drop 30kg and hit and then went a
wee way under my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I'm back up a wee bit. Not much: generally about 5kg or so above
that goal, most of that having turned up on the last 7 or 8 months (not
exactly coincidental that it's happened in conjunction with the new job, the
new work location, and the new commute). While it's no real cause for
concern -- I'm still generally careful and still get plenty of exercise
(normally walk around 35km a week, run 20km, get my 10k steps in every day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week back I decided that it was time to give myself a bit of
breathing room, to try and at least drop a couple or kg; so with that in
mind I set a lower daily calorie goal in my tacking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording my weight first thing this morning (yes, I'm one of those
people who records it every day and have for a few years -- it makes for
interesting data!), this is what my calorie/stats tracker had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of my calorie and weight tracking app" src="/attachments/2023/07/21/IMG_2475.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it's putting a positive spin in things? (for the record, I'm 5.3kg
&lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; my absolute goal).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="UI"></category><category term="UX"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="fitness"></category></entry><entry><title>textual-canvas v0.2.0</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/16/textual-canvas-0-2-0.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-16T09:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-16T09:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-16:/2023/07/16/textual-canvas-0-2-0.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Demo of textual-canvas" src="/attachments/2023/07/16/textual-canvas.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that for a good chunk of this year I've been a bit lax about writing
here, there's a couple or so coding projects I've not written about (well,
not on &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; anyway -- I have spoken lots about them &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep"&gt;over on
Fosstodon&lt;/a&gt;). One such project is
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-canvas/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;textual-canvas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name might suggest, it's a "canvas" for Textual applications, which
provides a pretty basic interface for drawing pixels, lines and circles --
and of course any other shape you are able to build up from those basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/releases/tag/v0.2.0"&gt;released a quick
update&lt;/a&gt; after
it was &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/discussions/1"&gt;requested that I add a &lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt; method to the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt;
widget&lt;/a&gt;; a request
that makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Textual"></category><category term="coding"></category><category term="PyPi"></category></entry></feed>
