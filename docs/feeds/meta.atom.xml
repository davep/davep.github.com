couple of days back&lt;/a&gt; I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog &lt;a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html"&gt;back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912"&gt;mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new&lt;/a&gt;, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that looks promising so far is &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also &lt;a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web"&gt;using the library when kicking
  off &lt;code&gt;ng2web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS feed generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax-highlighted code blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got off to a good start with an easy install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pelican[markdown]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then used the &lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rough
version of my blog up and going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a base theme that's to my taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Disqus working it so that any old comments remain in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get my image/attachment layout back in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.
;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting this up a couple of days back, I had to pin some packages
for the blog to older versions because of Ruby version issues; I'm sure
that Ruby has virtual environment solutions akin to Python, but diving
into that just for one tool... nah.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

year&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't make a point of intending to write
lots and often, I had hope that I'd manage something at least once a week;
perhaps at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been two main reasons why it's been quiet around here. The first is
that &lt;a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html"&gt;my (now not so) new job&lt;/a&gt;
keeps me busy (in a good way). It involves a reasonable amount of trekking
into town and back (which I don't mind on the whole), and once I'm home in
the evening I'm generally (but not always) done with the keyboard and desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason, which is probably the dafter one, is that a bit earlier
this year I finally upgraded my desktop setup from the 2019 Intel MacBook
Pro I was using to a recently-released M2Pro Mac Mini (and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; an
upgrade!). How this plays into blogging being even more quiet is... I needed
to set up jekyll again, and I'd forgotten how I got it running in the first
place, so I kept putting off getting it going, and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning, I sat down with coffee, grepped the &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; on my
previous machine, and got it running in like 5 minutes (of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, back adding another blog post. I'm writing this as much to
test that the setup works as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, this time, I'm going to try and make a promise to myself: I'm
going to try and write more. I can and should write about anything. I can
and should write short things as well as long things. I can and should
remember that it's not about writing things that are going to be super
important or anything like that, it's about just getting stuff down and
creating and recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note of course I said "try" and make a promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="Mac"></category><category term="Apple"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm back!</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2022/05/20/im-back.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-20T12:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-05-20T12:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2022-05-20:/2022/05/20/im-back.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm back! Almost. More or less. In more ways than one. First off, as often
happens with blogs (we've all been there right?), I've been away from

twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and have also stumbled into
&lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep"&gt;fosstodon as well&lt;/a&gt;. Doubtless …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm back! Almost. More or less. In more ways than one. First off, as often

twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and have also stumbled into
&lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep"&gt;fosstodon as well&lt;/a&gt;. Doubtless plenty of other
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big distraction for me, and one that is ongoing, is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg"&gt;mucking about on
YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Since the last time I wrote
anything on the blog I got myself a VR setup, and then a PCVR setup, and
then finally fibre came to the village and I could stream, and... well, you
can see how that would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in short, that's where I've been and that's what's been keeping me busy.
Now that I'm paying some attention to blogging again (hopefully!) I imagine
some of that will end up on here -- I'd quite like to write about VR and
gaming amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I said I'd been away in more ways than one. Another way is explained by
&lt;a href="/2019/10/18/time-to-move-on.html"&gt;this post from back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, where I
said I was going to head &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.dev/"&gt;over to Hashnode&lt;/a&gt; and
carry on blogging there, obviously with an emphasis on development and just
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kept me busy for a while and worked out well, mostly. But... well, see
above in part; I sort of ran out of steam when it came to purely-development
topics. But I still wanted to write, a bit, and wanted to write about more
than just development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, something else was bothering me about being over on Hashnode. In the
past year, in terms of what they promote themselves, especially blogs and
posts they promote on their Twitter feed, they seem to have started to lean
really hard into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g"&gt;crypto and web3 and
NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and all that stuff. This
left me feeling like that was all a bit icky and it was time to put some
distance between that platform and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the past couple of weeks, low-level and as a background task, I've
been back-porting posts from over there back into this blog. Starting with
this post all new blog content, be it about software development or anything
else, will be on here. If I'm really sensible and don't get distracted by
new shiny... this should be how it remains now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect some changes over the next few weeks. While I'm aiming to stick with
the core tech (Github pages, Markdown and Jekyll, Emacs to edit, etc), I'd
like to tinker with the look and layout of the blog. The content will remain
the same though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, anyway, if you're reading this... hey, it's good to be back. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="news"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>Time to move on</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/10/18/time-to-move-on.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-18T17:42:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-18T17:42:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2019-10-18:/2019/10/18/time-to-move-on.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's well over a year since I last wrote something on this blog.

mentioned in the last post (and the one before), it's not for bad reasons or
anything like that. Being in a new job, which actually isn't all that new
now, has kept me busy in all the best ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been other stuff going on too which has drawn on my attention and
the time and motivation to blog, either random stuff, or more
development-related stuff, just hasn't been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also... blogging via GitHub, using Jekyll, has lost a lot of its shine. It
sort of makes sense, well, sort of &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; sense, but in the end it felt like
more work than it should. Whereas most blogging systems tend to encourage
just diving in and banging on the keyboard, there's just a bit more faff
with the GitHub pages approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with that in mind, and with no desire right now to roll my own (which
would be fun, it has to be said), I'm going to &lt;a href="https://blog.davep.dev/"&gt;skip off over to Hashnode's
blogging system&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to have everything I'd
want and I can slap it on a domain of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my random musings about random things really happen on Twitter, so I
can't imagine I'll be wanting to blog about normal/mundane things. What I
would like to do is write about development-related things from time to
time. So that would seem to fit even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough of all this waffle. If you land here and it looks kind of
quiet, that's because it has been quiet for a while and I'm now going to try
and concentrate elsewhere, with a wish to do some coding-related writing now
and again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello, World!</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2015/06/18/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-18T14:53:00+01:00</published><updated>2015-06-18T14:53:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2015-06-18:/2015/06/18/hello-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set
of posts on &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; or a torrent
of 140-character thoughts on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; but
an actual blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set

an actual blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects
I want to have a go at over the next few months and writing about them as I
work on them might be fun. Another reason is that I've being wanting to explore
the business of hosting a blog on GitHub pages for quite some time and now's
the perfect time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how am I doing this? Well, for starters, I recently acquired an iMac. The
reasons for how and why I chose to do this are varied and mostly uninteresting
but what it does mean is that, for the first time in quite a long time, I
have a Unix desktop machine again. This fact alone means it's nice and easy
for me to play with the likes of Git (or, at the moment more
&lt;a href="https://mac.github.com/"&gt;GitHub for Mac&lt;/a&gt; than the command line git), ruby,
&lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;SublimeText&lt;/a&gt; (along with
&lt;a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll"&gt;a rather nifty package for quickly kicking off a blog post&lt;/a&gt;).
So that's how I'm doing it. Writing it all locally and pushing it up to
GitHub and hosting it with &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this goes on I imagine much will change. I've started out with a basic
setup, created by simply using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;davep@Ariel:~/blogging$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;jekyll&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;new&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;davep.github.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on I'll be playing with styles and my own layouts to see what I can
come up with and what I like (although, I most say, for the most part I'm
actually liking the clean look it delivers out of the box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that's obviously missing right now is a facility for commenting.
That's something I'll look into should I feel it's necessary -- from what I've
seen elsewhere it's easy enough to make use of something like
&lt;a href="https://disqus.com/"&gt;disqus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This has now happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing I might look at doing is putting this behind my own domain.
For the moment it's only available via github.io and I guess it might look
nicer if it was actually available via a URL that looks like the name I've
attached to the blog. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This has now happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's it for now. Time to push this up and think some more about
where it'll go from here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="Mac"></category></entry></feed>
