phones -- starting out with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic"&gt;HTC
Magic&lt;/a&gt; and going through a few
different phones before settling on Pixels (until I finally jumped ship to
iOS in 2020) -- I have to admit that there's always been something nice
about the design of iPhones. iOS, less so... My first exposure to iOS was
&lt;a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html"&gt;back in 2015 when I got an iPod&lt;/a&gt;,
and I wasn't terribly impressed. It looked okay, but it felt so far behind
Android in terms of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has changed and improved since then. These days, 3 years into being
totally consumed by the Apple ecosystem (one day I should write a post about
how comprehensively I've moved over), I'm won over and I like how iOS works
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-bad.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thing where, when you're in one app, it will show the most useless link
"back" to another app, and in doing so bump the time up and out of the way a
little. Like, seriously, compare it to when the app link thing isn't there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Good design" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/top-good.jpeg#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see it, you can't unsee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Toggle of the two images" src="/attachments/2023/09/23/bad-good-toggle.gif#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this time you'd think they would have found a less janky way of
doing this; perhaps even simply removed it (I can't remember the last time I
needed or wanted the ability to go "back" an app like this, especially not
with the bottom-of-screen swipe gesture being a thing). If nothing else
you'd think that, by now, they'd have found a way of doing it that doesn't
look so terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;"eh, let's just shove it here"&lt;/em&gt; approach that seems to be on display
here almost reminds me of &lt;a href="/2015/10/07/imac-time-wiggle.html"&gt;the "time wiggle" that used to mildly annoy me
back on my iMac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="iOS"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="design"></category></entry><entry><title>The HomePod fixed itself</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/12/the-homepod-fixed-itself.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-12T07:46:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-12T07:46:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-12:/2023/08/12/the-homepod-fixed-itself.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html#home-pod-stuck-installing"&gt;A couple of weeks
back&lt;/a&gt;
I mentioned home my main HomePod had got stuck installing 16.6 of the
software that runs it. This situation persisted for days after writing that
post and I kept promising myself that I was going to see if I could unstick
it by removing it from the Home, doing a factory reset and adding it back
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, during the week that followed, I never got round to that. You can
imagine what it's like: no time in the morning, and by the time I get home
in the evening I want to watch TV and use the HomePod as the speaker for the
Apple TV, I don't want to be doing tech support shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following weekend... yeah, I kinda forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, a couple of Saturdays on, it's early morning, I've had
breakfast and I'm having coffee and I think it's the perfect time to do
this. I hope the Home app my on iPad and... it's sorted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HomePod all good again" src="/attachments/2023/08/12/Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 07.25.44.png#centre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, it looks like it somehow managed to unstick itself in the end. A
quick test of some of the issues I was seeing suggested there was still an
issue, for example asking for the temperature in the bedroom would still
result in a &lt;em&gt;"working on it"&lt;/em&gt; reply followed by it telling me it wasn't
responding. A quick reset seems to have fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it's good to know: if it happens again, it'll keep on working as the
speaker for my Apple TV, and it'll eventually sort itself out even if I
don't muck about with a hard reset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Apple"></category></entry><entry><title>I turned it off and on again</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/08/10/i-turned-it-off-and-on-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-10T18:17:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-10T18:17:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-08-10:/2023/08/10/i-turned-it-off-and-on-again.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following on from &lt;a href="/2023/08/08/strange-obsidian-sync-issue.html"&gt;the previous
entry&lt;/a&gt;, where I outlined a
weird problem I'd started having with syncing Obsidian via iCloud, I finally
decided to sit down and try and work out the exact flow of the problem.
Today, for example, I'd created an entry in two different vaults on my phone
while on the bus into work, and when I got to my desk the vault I use on my
work machine had updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I got home this evening, the vault for my personal stuff
hadn't updated on my home Mac Mini. I tried a few edits, in both vaults, on
the iPhone, and nothing came through to the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... before I started really diving into things I decided to &lt;em&gt;"turn it off
and on again"&lt;/em&gt; -- the iPhone that is -- and when it came back I ran up
Obsidian, which told me it wasn't allowed to access my iCloud drive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a moment to go into the settings to try and figure it out, didn't
find what I wanted right away, then got to thinking that perhaps some of the
phone's services were still spinning up, so I ran Obsidian up again (after
killing it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, this time, it saw my vaults. With both vaults open on my Mac I
made edits to open entries and &lt;strong&gt;the edits started to flow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yup, looks like it was a simple case of &lt;em&gt;"turn it off and on again"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Not that heavily, not to the extent some
people do, but just as a way to keep a daily journal of work-related things.
Each day at &lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/"&gt;Textual HQ&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.textualize.io/about-us/"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; finish off with a chat about how
our day has gone, stuff we're wondering about, etc, etc... So I don't lose
tack of what I've been up to I keep notes and Obsidian is how I do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really like about it is how I can have iPhone, iPad and
macOS versions on the go and have it all sync via iCloud. It generally works
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the last couple of days I've noted the oddest problem, and I've yet
to pin down the exact flow. But it seems to be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I create or edit a note on my iPhone, it doesn't turn up on my Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I create or edit a note on my Mac, it turns up on my iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I might have seen variations on that theme but I've not made
careful note -- normally I'm made aware of it when I'm trying to get
something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's super weird is this: on the iPhone, if I create a note, and then go
into the &lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt; app and look at the iCloud folders for Obsidian, the file
isn't there! It's there in Obsidian itself, I can move it about, edit it,
etc, etc... but it's not in the "vault" as seen from the &lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the last part that has be really puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get to the bottom of this I'll try and remember to write up what I
find. I suspect I'm going to need some proper clear time, without other
distractions, and experiment with all the edit and sync options and see what
works and what fails.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Obsidian"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="iCloud"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="Mac"></category></entry><entry><title>HomePod Stuck Installing Update</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-29T07:56:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-29T07:56:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2023-07-29:/2023/07/29/home-pod-stuck-installing.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have three HomePods. I have a Mini in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.
I then have one of the newer-gen "big" HomePods in the living room, which
amongst other things is the speaker for my Apple TV device (yeah, I'm kinda
Apple all over the place these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week there was an update to the software, updating to 16.6. The two
Minis updated just fine. The big one, however, days later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HomePod stuck installing the update" src="/attachments/2023/07/29/HomePodStuck.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been like this all the time since the update turned up. I've tried a
reboot from the Home app. I've tried pulling the plug and plugging it in
again. Nope. It just keeps sitting there like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... it's working (more or less) fine. It's still playing music.
It's still being the speaker for the Apple TV. It still answers most
questions and performs most commands (most of the commands I give it are to
add stuff to my Reminders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasion if I ask it questions about other devices in the apartment
(&lt;em&gt;"hey siri, what's the temperature in the bedroom?"&lt;/em&gt;) it'll do the
&lt;em&gt;"working on it"&lt;/em&gt; thing and then give up saying the thing wasn't responding.
That seems to be about the worst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having checked this online it looks like, annoyingly, the one option I have
left is to do a full reset, removing it from my Home, doing a factory reset,
and then setting it up again. I'm sure it's something that'll take 10
minutes or so; but it's an annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;

been via a comment on some article on the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news"&gt;orange
site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I stumbled on a really
handy bit of free (as in beer) software called &lt;a href="https://quiche.works/reader/"&gt;Quiche
Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really simple and I feel &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the sort of thing I need. Over the
years I've tried all sorts of "save to read later" tools and systems; be it
things like Pocket, or tools now built into the browser these days, even
adding URLs to &lt;a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt; (back
when I used that) or (these days) Apple Reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever quite stuck. Normally I'd end up slapping stuff to read into
these systems and then never reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiche Reader, so far, feels like the perfect approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quiche Reader in action" src="/attachments/2023/07/27/quiche-reader.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple: if I see something I want to read a bit later I save it
into the application (which will sync to my other devices via iCloud). Then,
when I go to Quiche Reader, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to read the article or delete it and
move on. This is sort of what I'd do anyway, saving stuff up for months on
end until one day I'd declare saved reading bankruptcy and then start the
whole cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can look at the saved article stack and I'm forced to either read the
thing, or be honest with myself that if I'm not gonna read it now, I'm
probably never going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does have a "pause" facility (or something like that, I forget the name)
where you can throw an article to the back of the queue; but even then that
means it'll keep popping back to the top again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll see how it goes; but so far I feel like this is the best &lt;em&gt;"I'll save
this to read later"&lt;/em&gt; tool I've found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I KNOW! But there's so few places left to aimlessly scroll on
the bus now!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the month, having my morning coffee, I go and open my bank's mobile app to
move a bit of money about and pay a couple of things. This happens every
month. This is so routine I do it almost on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, I know, it's banking, pay attention! But still... morning,
coffee, routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to the final movement/payment and then notice something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Useless error message" src="/attachments/2022/06/03/Unexpected-error.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That.... that text! WTF? So then I look back at my payment history and
notice that all but one payment &lt;em&gt;hadn't&lt;/em&gt; gone through! O_o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alone is fine. Stuff happens. Things fail. I'm okay with that. It's an
inconvenience for sure but doubtless whatever the problem is will be fixed
and I can make the payments again later. But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That result. There's a tick. A &lt;strong&gt;GREEN&lt;/strong&gt; tick. And a "Thank you". It's
natural to see that image, know that it's always meant "shit worked" and
just carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my systems at work there's a tool I wrote for checking a
repository of code to make sure it conforms to a certain standard. When folk
use it they get a night big, bold and bright green thumb-up above the text
that says everything is cool. If there's a problem, any sort of problem at
all, then the display is red and there's no jolly icon and it's obvious that
things are different and you likely want to pay attention to the explanation
of what isn't right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't news, of course. This isn't some revelation about UI design or
anything. We know this stuff. I think what boggles my mind a little bit
about this is that something as important -- and hopefully by this point as
mature -- as a mobile banking app should get something as obvious as this
right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here we are, with a nice friendly green icon showing a tick and a
friendly big "Thank you" followed by smaller text going "aye shit didn't
work pal".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="UI"></category><category term="UX"></category></entry><entry><title>My VR recording setup</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2022/05/28/my-vr-recording-setup.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-28T17:01:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-05-28T17:01:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2022-05-28:/2022/05/28/my-vr-recording-setup.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For well over a year now I've been recording my VR gameplay &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg"&gt;and uploading
it to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Less as a "content
creation" thing, more as a nice record of games I've played and, on
occasion, as a little bit of help to others; in the past I've watched other
folk play games I like to get ideas for approaches to them, and I've also
received the odd comment now and again where my play-through has helped
someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question I've had a couple of times is what I use to do the recording, so
I thought I'd make an effort to write it all down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, a couple of things to note: I started recording PCVR around April
2021 and the initial setup was a bit trial-and-error and Google searching
and blog reading. As such, not all of the details of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to set up will be
here, and I may even miss off some stuff I changed and is worthy of note; at
the same time I might mention stuff that's just an obvious default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this blog post as being a written version of one of my videos: it's
for my own fun and benefit and might also help me in the future should I
want to apply some of this again, and if it helps someone else that's a
lovely bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's not exactly the point of this post, I guess it's worth mentioning
the hardware I use as of the time of writing. Given this is about PCVR, I of
course have a PC which is running Windows. The machine information within
Windows says it's a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: I don't do hardware. I buy it from time to time, but hardware
leaves me bored. It runs VR on a PC. This is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine itself has 16 GB of memory, is running Windows 10 Home and has a
GeForce RTX 3060 for handling the graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headset I'm using is a~~n Oculus~~ Meta Quest 2. I've had this
since around November 2020, playing Quest-native games for the first few
months, until I cracked and got the PC mentioned here to get into PCVR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headset is connected to the PC with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08MJDNV4F/"&gt;a USB
cable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for recording voice, I use a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08T1S7NRP/?th=1"&gt;USB lapel microphone with a really
long cable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be said that, yes, sometimes, I do get a little caught up in
things with two cables hanging off me. If I could give one tip here it would
be that running the microphone cable up your trousers and shirt makes life a
ton easier. As a bonus I have the USB cable for the headset running around
the headset's strap and connected to it at the back and then running down my
back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core software used is &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;. This has
got to be one of the best bits of free software I've ever used, in terms of
interface and what it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years back my son used to record and upload gameplay to YouTube and I can
remember him having no end of issues using different recording software;
some working with one game but not another, some other working with a
different set of games, video and sync issues, etc... Lots of pain quite
often. With OBS Studio the only issues I've ever had have been my own
mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I have to confess that when I set it up I didn't make a point
of keeping a recording of what I changed -- I was experimenting and not
expecting much to come of it. So what I note here are the things that feel
like they're important, and only the things that relate to recording PCVR,
not streaming it (that might end up being a different blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, here are things I seem to remember as being key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The items in the output pane in settings that I have and which might be
important are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Output Mode:&lt;/code&gt; Simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Recording Quality&lt;/code&gt;: High Quality, Medium File Size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Recording format&lt;/code&gt;: mkv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt;: Hardware (NVENC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do remember the recording format being set to &lt;code&gt;mkv&lt;/code&gt; as something that's
really important. I think it's &lt;code&gt;mp4&lt;/code&gt; by default, or was when I first
installed, and if your machine crashes or OBS were to crash or something,
you could end up with footage that can't be used. Using &lt;code&gt;mkv&lt;/code&gt; means you can
still use the footage (as I understand it). It does mean that once you're
finished you have to use the "remux" option under the &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; menu, but
that's a small price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say that at least once I've had to hard-reboot my machine when a game
and SteamVR and the like all got upset. I likely saved 45 minutes or more of
footage thanks to &lt;code&gt;mkv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Video Settings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing really special in here, I simply have both the base and output
resolutions set to the desktop resolution. This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be something for me
to tinker with in the future, but so far I've not run into any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;VR Capture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, all of the above is great and fine and all but there's the
issue of how you capture the VR gameplay. I approach this a couple of
different ways. The first is I use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/baffler/OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin"&gt;OpenVR Capture plugin for
OBS&lt;/a&gt;. This makes
capturing footage from SteamVR really easy. The only downside I found is
that out of the box there's no default crop setting for using a Quest 2 (or
I guess the Rift, as the Quest 2 sort of appears as a Rift to SteamVR
games). As such I remember playing trial and error with that until I was
happy I was getting as much footage as possible without having black bars
and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I also like about the OpenVR Capture plugin is you can say if you
want to capture the left or right eye. Normally not that big a deal for some
things, but if you're playing a shooter and want people to see exactly what
your dominant eye is seeing, that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, of course, not every game can be captured with that plugin. So far
I've found that any game that can't be has its own mirror window on the
desktop. In that case I use a &lt;code&gt;Game Capture&lt;/code&gt; source and set it to capture
that specific window. I could of course just get it to capture the focused
window or something like that but I prefer to know that it's only grabbing
what I want it to grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it I think. There's not a lot to it, although on occasion
a lot can go wrong. Mostly it's a wonder any of it works. I mean, think
about it, I have a computer with two screens strapped to my face, with two
controllers in my hands talking to it; it's then connected via the Oculus
Link to the Oculus Home; from which I start up SteamVR; and from the SteamVR
home I start up the game and then "live" inside the game. It's a virtual
world inside a virtual world inside a virtual world inside a real world;
with lots of software along the way, all talking at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is then being recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, on occasion, it takes a reboot or five to make it all work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, it's a wonder it ever works. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="VR"></category><category term="YouTube"></category><category term="PCVR"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I really like fish abbreviations</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2019/10/23/why-i-really-like-fish-abbreviations.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-23T00:18:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-23T00:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2019-10-23:/2019/10/23/why-i-really-like-fish-abbreviations.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm filing this as a TIL because, while it wasn't T, I did L it very
recently and it was a new trick that impacted on around 25 years if prior
working practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it must have been around 1991 when I first encountered
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS"&gt;4DOS&lt;/a&gt;. While I'd used the odd Unix
shell here and there previously, it'd only been in passing. It was 4DOS that
first introduced me to the power of aliases on the command line. Many of the
aliases I set up and used in 4DOS still remain with me to this day, on
GNU/Linux and macOS, in some form or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone reading this why aliases and cool and
handy and pretty much vital if you do lots of work on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, a couple or so weeks ago, as a very recent convert to
&lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered the
&lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#abbr"&gt;&lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command. At
first glance it didn't seem to make much sense. It was like
&lt;a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#alias"&gt;&lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, only it
expanded what you typed rather than acted as a command in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of digging and some of it started to make sense. One thing that
really won me over -- and while it's something that doesn't directly impact
on me -- was the argument that it allows for a far more transparent command
history; especially if you're likely to use a transcript of a shell session
in a place where people might not know or have access to your aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being in a position where you have loads of handy and cool aliases,
but you also need to record what you've done so other people can follow your
work (does it show that I sit amongst people who maintain lab notebooks?);
it seems like it would be a bit of a bother needing to record all of the
aliases in your own work environment up front. Without that information few
people will be able to make sense of the recorded commands, with that
information they'd still need to double-check what each command does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So imagine an alias that, when used, expands in place. Then you'd get all of
the benefit of aliases while also having a full and readable record of what
you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a silly example. For a long time I've carried around an alias called
&lt;code&gt;greedy&lt;/code&gt; that runs something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;du&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-hs&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-rh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's pretty straightforward: I'm using &lt;code&gt;du&lt;/code&gt; to get a sense of which
directories are using what space, and then using &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; to make a
worst-to-best-offender list out of it. So I could use an alias:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;greedy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;du -hs * | sort -rh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside to this is that, any time I run it, if I were to record
the shell session and make it available for someone else to read, they'd
just see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/develop$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;greedy
&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.1G&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;JavaScript
824M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;C
699M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;rust
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;93M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;python
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;33M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;fonts
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;33M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;elisp
&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.4M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;zsh
&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.0M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;misc
&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.1M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;bash
840K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ocaml
428K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;C++
316K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;lisp
172K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Swift
152K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;git
132K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ruby
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;28K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ObjC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with an abbreviation rather than an alias, I'd type &lt;code&gt;greedy&lt;/code&gt; but as
soon as I hit &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; it'd get expanded to something anyone could read and
follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/develop$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;du&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-hs&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-rh
&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.1G&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;JavaScript
824M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;C
699M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;rust
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;93M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;python
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;33M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;fonts
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;33M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;elisp
&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.4M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;zsh
&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.0M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;misc
&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.1M&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;bash
840K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ocaml
428K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;C++
316K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;lisp
172K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Swift
152K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;git
132K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ruby
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;28K&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;ObjC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is far from the only benefit of abbreviations; for most people it
probably isn't one of the most important ones, but I find it neat and
compelling and this alone drove me to rework almost all of my aliases as
abbreviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done that, I get other benefits too. For example, fish (like other
shells) has good support for argument completion for well-known commands.
The problem is, if you alias such a command, you don't get that completion.
With an abbreviation though you do! All you need to do is type the
abbreviation, hit &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt; and it'll expand to the underlying command and
then the full range of completion can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also one last reason why I like abbreviations over aliases, and it's
kind of a silly one, but in a good way. It's actually fun to see what you
type magically expand as you do things, it makes you look like you can type
even faster than you normally can! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: If you've never tried &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; before and you're curious, it's easy to
&lt;a href="https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/"&gt;try in your browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="fish"></category><category term="shell"></category></entry><entry><title>I want to like Gboard</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/03/13/i_want_to_like_gboard.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-13T08:29:16+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-13T08:29:16+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2017-03-13:/2017/03/13/i_want_to_like_gboard.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to like Gboard. On paper it looks really rather good. It's a keyboard
from Google, it ties in with your account, it syncs things, it has clever
searching for emoji and gifs and the like... what's not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem is, I've been a user of SwiftKey since around 2011 (I think it was).
I'm very used to how SwiftKey works and it also contains a lot of handy
things. I like that it has smart completion, that it learns how I type a bit
skewed and that it takes this into account, that I can turn off the fancy
swipe typing and instead make use of handy gestures like swipe-left to
delete a word. I like some of the themes a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the mix comes my iPad, which I use on occasion. The standard Apple
keyboard is horrible and, sadly, I find SwiftKey on iOS just as frustrating.
It seems to lack enough key features there (especially the word deletion
gesture, as far as I can tell) that it's also a bit annoying. My dream of a
consistent typing experience across all devices just wasn't happening --
until I found Gboard on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That felt almost right. And from what I could tell it worked almost exactly
the same on iOS and Android. So it felt like a good time to try and force
myself to use Gboard on my Google Pixel and Nexus 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, though, I'm just not getting on with it. It's okay. It's not bad.
It's just... not good. I'm finding that it lacks enough useful things that
it's a frustrating experience. Little things like: when I enter Google
Search, there's no word completion in the keyboard (SwiftKey has that); the
word deletion gesture (swipe left from the backspace key) seems very
hit-and-miss; the most obvious completion for a word sometimes appears in
the middle slot but, other times, in the left slot. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing huge. Nothing that's a show-stopper. But a handful of a little
things that make me miss the comfortable home that is SwiftKey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, it does have some very handy and cleaver features too.
The searching for emoji -- including showing them up as word completions --
is rather clever. The gif-search thing is all kinds of fun too (mostly used
to annoy the hell out
of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VolcanicArts"&gt;my son on twitter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those quite make up for the bits I miss from SwiftKey though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I've being making a point of pushing on with Gboard, thinking
that most of my issues might just be because I'm too used to my "old home".
Mostly this was working well, until I noticed something this morning. While
reading the description for Gboard I noticed this handy thing in the "Pro
Tips" section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sync your learned words across devices to improve suggestions (enable in
Gboard Settings→ Dictionary → Sync learned words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful! I'd assumed that this was the case anyway -- it's Google after all
-- but it's good to know I can ensure it's turned on. So I went to turn it
on. This is what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gboard WTF" src="/attachments/2017/03/13/Screenshot_20170313-072359.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell Google? Sure, I do have a Gsuite account on my phone -- as in
various apps have access to a Gsuite account (Gmail, Drive, etc...) -- but
it's not the primary account on my phone and it's not the account I'd really
want to be doing the dictionary sync with anyway. If I've got dictionary
sync I want it tied to the keyboard no matter the app I'm in, and no matter
the account I'm using in that app. I want the keyboard to be tied to a
specific account when it comes to sync (just like SwiftKey does it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, I think, is a show-stopper for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can overlook the other niggles, I can learn to cope with it not being
quite so perfect in some situations; but the blanket inability to do
something as simple as cloud-sync the predictions and learn from how I type
-- things that are, these days, central to what Google's about -- it's
frankly stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I'm going to have to keep Gboard as a backup keyboard for those
times when I need to find the perfect gif.&lt;/p&gt;

Now. It first seemed to start on my Nexus 7, then appeared on my Nexus 6.
More recently, even as of today, I've seen it on
my &lt;a href="/2017/03/08/hello_google_pixel.html"&gt;Google Pixel&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that,
in the Google Now launcher (or on the Pixel, in the Pixel launcher), the
Google Now page (that you swipe to the left for) sits empty for ages. All I
see is the little animated waiting circle and nothing else. Once or twice
I've had the Google app die and restart or, more often than not, after quite
some time it finally loads up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter happened a little earlier and I noticed something I'd not seen
before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blank Google Now" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-115910.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's with that "Achievements" menu option? You'll notice that the whole of
the menu is blank -- no profile picture or anything and none of the menu
options seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after I'd left it for a while, it ended up working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Now finally working" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-120052.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, once this happened, no "Achievements" option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably this is some back-end server issue, I'm being served up something
I'm not supposed to be seeing and it's confusing the client app. Okay, I
don't &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that's the case, but it has that sort of feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I need to go looking for what this Achievements thing is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Google, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Google"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello Google Pixel</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2017/03/08/hello_google_pixel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-08T12:22:05+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-08T12:22:05+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2017-03-08:/2017/03/08/hello_google_pixel.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past two years I've, mostly, being happily using a Google Nexus 6 as
my phone. In the past six months or so I've started to notice that it hasn't
been quite as good as it was. The main problem, for me, was that the camera
was starting to play out. The issues were the ones that I've seen reported
elsewhere: use of the camera would quickly make the phone laggy, very slow
response times on pressing the shutter, occasional failure to save an image,
etc. This was generally frustrating and, even more so, because &lt;a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html"&gt;I'd got back
into photoblogging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile... I've been lusting over the Google Pixel ever since it was
originally shown off. I was some way off my phone contract renewal and the
price of a new Pixel was something I just couldn't justify. Last week though
an offer cropped up that meant I could renew early &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; get a Pixel
(including a free Daydream headset thrown in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to Monday just gone and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My new Pixel" src="/attachments/2017/03/08/IMG_20170308_120458.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I'm liking it rather a lot. It is odd that it's smaller in my hand
than the Nexus 6 was (the XL wasn't an available option &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I was also
starting to think it was time to drop down in size a little again) but I'm
also finding it a little easier to work with; it's also nice that it fits in
trouser pockets as well as jacket pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels very fast (although every Android phone and tablet I've ever had
have felt fast to start with) and smooth to use. I especially like the
default feedback vibration -- it's a lot smoother yet also more reassuring
than any I've felt before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Assistant is proving to be very handy. I'm sort of used to it
anyway thanks to having owned an Android Wear watch for a couple of years
but having it on the phone like this seems like a natural next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I'm getting very used to very quickly, and really liking a
lot, is fingerprint recognition. I didn't think I needed it but now I'm
wondering how I ever managed without it. Combined with the notification
pull-down gesture that the recognition area supports it seems like a perfect
way to open the get going with a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a couple of niggles with it, of course. The main one for me is the
lack of wireless charging. That was something I really liked about the Nexus
6: I could be sat at my desk and have the phone sat on top of a charging
pad, staying topped up. No such handy setup with the Pixel. The other thing
is the lack of water resistance. To be fair: it's not something I've ever
really felt I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; with other phones and I'm not in the habit of
sticking them under water; but knowing that it doesn't matter too much if it
gets exposed to rain would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that... there's not much else to say right now. It works and
works well, the move from the N6 to it was pretty smooth and the Pixel has
fallen perfectly into my normal routine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Google"></category><category term="Android"></category><category term="Phone"></category></entry><entry><title>A bit of a backlog at the Apple store</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/11/03/a_bit_of_a_backlog_at_the_apple_store.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-03T13:45:35+00:00</published><updated>2016-11-03T13:45:35+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2016-11-03:/2016/11/03/a_bit_of_a_backlog_at_the_apple_store.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple or so
weeks &lt;a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html"&gt;my Macbook air&lt;/a&gt; has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="iMac"></category><category term="OS X"></category></entry><entry><title>Evernote's confusing menu</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/10/31/evernotes_confusing_menu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-31T11:38:41+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-31T11:38:41+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2016-10-31:/2016/10/31/evernotes_confusing_menu.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I stumbled on a tip about Evernote. It
was
&lt;a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/10/28/one-student-made-productivity-habit/"&gt;a snippet of information in a bigger post on the Evernote blog&lt;/a&gt;
so I saved it to Evernote (obviously) to take a look at later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip was that Ctrl-Cmd-B in Evernote (on the Mac) will format a body of
text as source code. While I'm not in the habit of using Evernote to store
code, not even snippets of code (that's something far better served
by &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/"&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;), it seemed like something worth
committing to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, while finally in front of a suitable machine, I took a look.
Sure enough, there's the menu option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.36.42.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handy! So I created a test note with some code in it so that I could see how
it formatted it. I was curious to see if it just did simple fixed text or if
it offered options to highlight various languages (I didn't hold out much
hope for the latter, but it was worth a look).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when it got odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I created a note and went to format some code, the menu option
disappeared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lack of code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.37.07.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. At
least, not until you actually close down Evernote and start it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, none of this is the case in the Windows version. While the
key combination is different there, the menu option is available and stays
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of Evernote I have (on my iMac and my Macbook) is 6.9.2. The
version number on Windows is 6.4.2 (after checking for updates -- I'm going
to guess that the Mac and Windows version numbers don't match on purpose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodness knows what's going on here. All I can imagine is that it has
something to do
with
&lt;a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/97731-code-block-in-evernote-for-mac/"&gt;a thread I found on Evernote's support forum&lt;/a&gt; that
suggests that code block formatting is some sort of test/beta feature and
can only be enabled via a settings option that &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; available via the
version downloaded from the Apple App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at some point, I guess I'm going to have to uninstall Evernote from the
Macbook and the iMac, reinstall from the Evernote website itself, and try
this again. All of which seems a bit silly when &lt;em&gt;the menu option is there
and visible when I run Evernote up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit to add:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure enough, removing the App Store version and installing
the version from Evernote's own website, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; going into preferences
and enabling the option, sorted it. It's still really odd they'd promote the
facility via the blog and not mention it, and also very odd that the option
would always show until the first time you're in a position to use it, and
then it'd disappear.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Evernote"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>I now own a Macbook</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-28T20:07:10+01:00</published><updated>2016-04-28T20:07:10+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2016-04-28:/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to go and look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having looked I came away with one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Mac"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="iMac"></category><category term="Unix"></category></entry><entry><title>Until next alarm is back</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2015/12/17/until-next-alarm-is-back.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-17T11:32:44+00:00</published><updated>2015-12-17T11:32:44+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2015-12-17:/2015/12/17/until-next-alarm-is-back.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now and again Google seem to actually listen. While they do generally have a
bad habit of removing things from things and saying it's for everyone's good
(because options are bad and they can't maintain them, apparently) it seems
they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do the odd turnaround now and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing they removed from Android recently was the
"&lt;a href="/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html"&gt;until next alarm&lt;/a&gt;""
option when putting a device in "do not disturb" mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a small thing, but it makes so much more sense and makes things so much
easier (even if it's a trivial thing).&lt;/p&gt;

I
stated with them during the old tenner-a-month days when there were only a
handful of points-of-presence to be called. I stuck with them through them
getting full local POP coverage, through having an ISDN line and then finally
ADSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved though I decided it might be easier to just go with BT; for the
most part this hasn't actually been a bad decision. This week though I suffered
my first proper outage with them and it was rather frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It kicked off at around 2015-11-16 21:00. I noticed that Google Drive (in
Chrome) was complaining that it was offline. I then noticed that gmail and
a couple of other tabs in Chrome were complaining about the same thing. I
did a couple of local network checks and found nothing, checked the router and
it was connected and reporting just fine, so then I rebooted the router and
things appeared to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a short while anyway. Then I started to notice other problems; mostly that
some sites would time out, others not. Initially I was getting a lot of DNS
timeouts and, while I normally use Google's DNS servers (BT's have long had
lots of problems&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), I tried switching back to BT's own and that appeared
to improve matters. For a while anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the issues on twitter and got a handful of replies from different
people running into similar issues. It was clear that this wasn't just me. I
then went looking for BT's broadband status page but hilariously was unable
to load it because of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first bit of real frustration with them. Here's how the page
looks inside a desktop browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Status in desktop browser" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-18 at 10.42.40.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare it as seen inside Android Chrome on my Nexus 6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Status on my phone" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screenshot_20151118-104156.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently they have decided that I'd never want to be able to check why my
broadband might be down, from a mobile device. Yes, sure, there's the option
to put my phone number in -- perhaps it tells me after I've done that -- but
I don't even know my land line number; I don't use it as a phone most of the
time and so never bother remembering it. The main point here is why the hell
wouldn't they include the same useful information as the desktop view? Or
perhaps use geolocation of the phone to narrow things down if they feel the
need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I gave up and went to bed. In the morning things were no better but,
after another router reboot, I did manage to get a view of the status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Finally got to see broadband status" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 10.29.47.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally! Acknowledgement of the problem. Worryingly though it was dated almost
12 hours after I first noticed the problem. From what I can see that date and
time isn't the date and time the status was last updated, it's the date and
time it was first added. That suggest that they really hadn't noticed the
problem all night. It's not like it was a problem that was hard to notice,
at least from a customer's point of view. Check this graph from a &lt;a href="http://downdetector.co.uk/problems/bt-british-telecom"&gt;down
detector site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="It really was down" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 10.27.07.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd think that a company as big as BT would have something in place that could
catch network problems, especially ones that are able to be caught with a simple
crowdsourcing "press this button if you have a problem" approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... nope. Appears not. O_o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a couple or so hours later the problem was finally fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Finally got to see broadband status" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 13.01.00.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Notice how the date and time is the same as earlier; so 100% not an update time
but a first-added time) I mentioned this on twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like BT broadband problems are resolved. Everything working that I can see, and this... &lt;a href="https://t.co/m5Mo7vm5Yu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/m5Mo7vm5Yu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/666602185233440768"&gt;November 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I even got a reply (which I'd not gone looking for, so that was nice):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg"&gt;@davepdotorg&lt;/a&gt; Yes Dave we have the problem fixed, if you still notice a few issues then reset the hub and try again. ^Chris&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; BT (@BTCare) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare/status/666642010045050880"&gt;November 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious as to why it'd take almost 12 hours from the problem appearing to it
being acknowledged on their status, I thought I'd ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare"&gt;@BTCare&lt;/a&gt; All looking good. Any reason why it took 12 hours to acknowledge?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/666642201783480320"&gt;November 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which got this reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg"&gt;@davepdotorg&lt;/a&gt; Sorry it took so long, identifing the source of the problems would have taken some time. ^Shane&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; BT (@BTCare) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare/status/666666833148268548"&gt;November 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. Sure, you to spend time
identifying the source of a problem to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; it, but you don't need to do that
to notice and acknowledge that there's a problem. I've asked again but
haven't received any sort of reply as of the time of writing (I'm not expecting
one really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I take from all of this is that BT are shockingly bad at keeping people
informed of problems with their service when there's a large outage. I find
that kind of annoying. I don't mind that there are problems, I do mind when
a company can't take the time to clearly and quickly state "yup, it's us, it's
not you, we're looking into it..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't even get me started on how the HH5 won't allow setting of DNS servers in the hub itself. That's stupid and frustrating beyond words.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my iMac. It's not "native" to
it so I got to wondering how you go about getting something like that onto it.
Sure, I could have just grabbed the source and built myself, but really it's
a lot nicer to use some sort of package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search lead me to &lt;a href="http://brew.sh/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; and I was then up and
running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in turn got me to thinking about how it might be fun to get some of the
software I used to use on my GNU/Linux machine up and running again. The first
one that came to mind was &lt;a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;slrn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sure enough
slrn is available via Homebrew and installing it was dead simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I was faced with a problem: I needed an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol"&gt;NNTP&lt;/a&gt; server.
Way back I used to run a local one in my office that fed from and to my
ISP's. Back then my ISP was Demon Internet; these days I'm with BT. A quick
search lead me to an article or two that BT had a NNTP server, of sorts,
provided by a third party. So I did a quick check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.27.43.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay! This looked good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I fired up &lt;code&gt;slrn&lt;/code&gt; and.... problems. It kept asking me to log in,
to provide a user name and password. The only problem was that I'd read in more
than one place that a user name and password weren't needed for BT's server;
all that was required was you be on a BT IP address. Checking the slrn docs
I found &lt;a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-manual-6.html#ss6.32"&gt;&lt;code&gt;force_authentication&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
but ensuring that was off made no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I removed &lt;code&gt;slrn&lt;/code&gt; and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, thinking it might be an issue with just &lt;code&gt;slrn&lt;/code&gt; and perhaps it was worth
trying a native NNTP client, I grabbed Unison
(&lt;a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/"&gt;which is no longer supported&lt;/a&gt;
but seems to work fine). I got that set up and ran into the same issue: it
wanted login details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after a bit more digging, I stumbled on the reason why I was struggling
to make any of this work: &lt;a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51205/?s_cid=con_FURL_giganews"&gt;BT had closed support for the server back in
December last year&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search around the web and I stumbled on &lt;a href="http://www.eternal-september.org/"&gt;Eternal September&lt;/a&gt;.
Given all I was interested in was the good old text groups this looked perfect.
I quickly registered an account, ran up Unison again and plugged in my details
and....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.19.17.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's all sorted I should try again with &lt;code&gt;slrn&lt;/code&gt;. At which point I'll need
to drag out and tidy up &lt;code&gt;post.el&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="http://post-mode.sourceforge.net/"&gt;the version that was being maintained
by some other people seems to have gone very stale&lt;/a&gt;, sadly).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="OS X"></category><category term="iMac"></category><category term="NNTP"></category><category term="usenet"></category><category term="Homebrew"></category></entry><entry><title>I miss "Until next alarm"</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-12T14:20:23+00:00</published><updated>2015-11-12T14:20:23+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2015-11-12:/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I actually can't remember when the change was now, it was either Android 5.0
or one of the 5.x point releases, but I can recall the frustration of Google
having changed how you make an Android device silent, or not. The idea seemed
clever enough but it was a real pain to switch to and use. Previously there'd
simply been this neat system of setting he volume to either be some non-off
value, vibrate or totally silent. I even had a neat little widget on the home
screen of my phone to allow me to toggle between these 3 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was simple, and worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system though.... ugh. It was confusing and so much more long-winded
to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point though they added one big redeeming feature: "Until next alarm".
When I got into bed I could tell my tablet to go totally silent until my
alarm went off in the morning, and then it would all work as normal. That was
an utterly brilliant idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it made sense that if they changed anything about this in Marshmallow they'd
keep that in and make it even more awesome, right? Right?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nope" src="/attachments/2015/11/12/Screenshot_20151112-140600.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well fuck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Just..... why?!? I actually prefer how the new one works. They've more or
less solved the problem of how it was more faff to deal with, they've solved
the problem of having to cock about with the volume rocker to get at the
settings and then set the settings. I like all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But taking "Until next alarm" away? That's just nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I really get the impression that the Android developers are like the
Chrome OS developers: they're having a ton of fun improving and onward developing
the system but they have little connection to how people actually use this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Android"></category><category term="Google"></category><category term="Marshmallow"></category></entry><entry><title>Voice search failing on Nexus 6</title><link href="https://blog.davep.org/2015/11/11/voice-search-failing-on-nexus-6.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-11T16:07:25+00:00</published><updated>2015-11-11T16:07:25+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave Pearson</name></author><id>tag:blog.davep.org,2015-11-11:/2015/11/11/voice-search-failing-on-nexus-6.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been quite a while since I used voiced search on my Nexus 6. Ever since
I got the Moto 360 I've not really had a need to say "OK Google" to my phone
because I could simply say it to my wrist. Today though, because I wanted to
quickly look something up and my phone was to hand, I spoke to it and got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Voice search fail" src="/attachments/2015/11/11/Screenshot_20151111-154157.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been here before. I had &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/fP9kdADZPQ9"&gt;exactly this sort of problem with my Xperia Z
at one point&lt;/a&gt;.
The problem appeared to go away eventually (actually, it sort of came and
went a few times over a matter of weeks, if I recall correctly), although I
never really got to the bottom of the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried rebooting the phone and that hasn't helped at all. While it's more
of a vague annoyance than anything else (like I say above, my Android Wear
device is my goto tool for talking to Google these days) it does frustrate a
little when fairly expensive tools don't "just work".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="Google"></category><category term="Android"></category><category term="Nexus"></category></entry></feed>
