Despite having grown up
in the 80s, and so having a good vinyl collection, and then having got into
buying all the CDs in the 90s and 00s, these days I have managed to embrace
the "just stream all the things" approach. After a long time using Spotify I
finally ended up migrating to Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I do find Apple Music does well is the whole "you seem to
like this, have you tried this?" thing; which on occasion has resulted in a
pretty neat rabbit hole of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year this happened with &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/109709660400107128"&gt;female-fronted Dutch goth/rock type
bands&lt;/a&gt;. I don't even
remember how that happened, but it's a thing that happened and I gleefully
dived right in. I came away with a few names I didn't know before, but one
album has really stuck in my head and, now that we're just over 1/2 way
through the year, I feel it's the one that gets played more than anything
else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This keeps creeping back to the top of things I'm playing; sometimes when
I'm in "bang on the keyboard lots" coding mode (you know the sort of coding
mode: where you don't have to think too much because you have a good plan
for what you're doing, but you've got a lot of tapping away to do), plus
also often while I'm in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't be the least bit surprised to find that this ends up being my
most-played album this year. According to last.fm it's at the top of the
albums I've played (in places where I have scrobbling set up) in the last
365 days.&lt;/p&gt;
