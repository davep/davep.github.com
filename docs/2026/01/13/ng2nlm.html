<meta name="description" content="After having knocked up obs2nlm the other day I realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be fun to throw into NotebookLM: one or more of the Norton Guide files in my collection! And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon, ng2nlm was born. In terms of what it does, it&#39;s pretty much the same as obs2nlm, only it uses ngdb to read the contents of a Norton Guide and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source in NotebookLM.

Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and let it do its thing.

Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to nowhere when it&#39;s emitting code.

Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where the confusion comes from. In &#34;normal&#34; paragraphs it does do a good job of citing its source and linking to it: so presumably, when it &#34;thinks&#34; it&#39;s outputting code it doesn&#39;t do the markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little confused. If I ask that citations aren&#39;t included in the code, this does seem to have the desired effect: So, given this, perhaps I can use the --additional-instructions switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links to code?

    <p>After having knocked up <a href="/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html">obs2nlm the other day</a> I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: <a href="/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html">one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection</a>!</p>
<p>And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as <code>obs2nlm</code>, only it
uses <a href="https://ngdb.davep.dev"><code>ngdb</code></a> to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be working a treat.</p>
<p><img alt="Learning abut low-level DOS programming" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/low-level-dos.png#centre"></p>
<p>Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.</p>
<p>I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a <em>long</em>
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I <em>think</em> this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What are all the numbers in square brackets for?</p>
<p><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
[Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source <em>and linking to it</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="NotebookLM citing a source" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre"></p>
<p>so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.</p>
<p>If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:</p>
<p><img alt="No citations in the code" src="/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre"></p>
<p>So, given this, perhaps I can use the
<a href="https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions"><code>--additional-instructions</code></a>
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak <code>ng2nlm</code> itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm"><code>ng2nlm</code></a> exists.</p>
