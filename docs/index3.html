      <div><p>A couple of days back (for vague values of "couple", of course), first of
the month, having my morning coffee, I go and open my bank's mobile app to
move a bit of money about and pay a couple of things. This happens every
month. This is so routine I do it almost on autopilot.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know, it's banking, pay attention! But still... morning,
coffee, routine.</p>
<p>I get to the final movement/payment and then notice something:</p>
<p><img alt="Useless error message" src="/attachments/2022/06/03/Unexpected-error.jpeg"></p>
<p>That.... that text! WTF? So then I look back at my payment history and
notice that all but one payment <em>hadn't</em> gone through! O_o</p>
<p>This alone is fine. Stuff happens. Things fail. I'm okay with that. It's an
inconvenience for sure but doubtless whatever the problem is will be fixed
and I can make the payments again later. But...</p>
<p>That result. There's a tick. A <strong>GREEN</strong> tick. And a "Thank you". It's
natural to see that image, know that it's always meant "shit worked" and
just carry on.</p>
<p>In one of my systems at work there's a tool I wrote for checking a
repository of code to make sure it conforms to a certain standard. When folk
use it they get a night big, bold and bright green thumb-up above the text
that says everything is cool. If there's a problem, any sort of problem at
all, then the display is red and there's no jolly icon and it's obvious that
things are different and you likely want to pay attention to the explanation
of what isn't right.</p>
<p>This isn't news, of course. This isn't some revelation about UI design or
anything. We know this stuff. I think what boggles my mind a little bit
about this is that something as important -- and hopefully by this point as
mature -- as a mobile banking app should get something as obvious as this
right.</p>
<p>But here we are, with a nice friendly green icon showing a tick and a
friendly big "Thank you" followed by smaller text going "aye shit didn't
work pal".</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For well over a year now I've been recording my VR gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg">and uploading
it to YouTube</a>. Less as a "content
creation" thing, more as a nice record of games I've played and, on
occasion, as a little bit of help to others; in the past I've watched other
folk play games I like to get ideas for approaches to them, and I've also
received the odd comment now and again where my play-through has helped
someone else.</p>
<p>A question I've had a couple of times is what I use to do the recording, so
I thought I'd make an effort to write it all down here.</p>
<p>First up, a couple of things to note: I started recording PCVR around April
2021 and the initial setup was a bit trial-and-error and Google searching
and blog reading. As such, not all of the details of <em>how</em> to set up will be
here, and I may even miss off some stuff I changed and is worthy of note; at
the same time I might mention stuff that's just an obvious default.</p>
<p>Consider this blog post as being a written version of one of my videos: it's
for my own fun and benefit and might also help me in the future should I
want to apply some of this again, and if it helps someone else that's a
lovely bonus.</p>
<h1>The Hardware</h1>
<p>While it's not exactly the point of this post, I guess it's worth mentioning
the hardware I use as of the time of writing. Given this is about PCVR, I of
course have a PC which is running Windows. The machine information within
Windows says it's a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warning: I don't do hardware. I buy it from time to time, but hardware
leaves me bored. It runs VR on a PC. This is fine.</p>
<p>The machine itself has 16 GB of memory, is running Windows 10 Home and has a
GeForce RTX 3060 for handling the graphics.</p>
<p>The headset I'm using is a~~n Oculus~~ Meta Quest 2. I've had this
since around November 2020, playing Quest-native games for the first few
months, until I cracked and got the PC mentioned here to get into PCVR.</p>
<p>The headset is connected to the PC with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08MJDNV4F/">a USB
cable</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, for recording voice, I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08T1S7NRP/?th=1">USB lapel microphone with a really
long cable</a>.</p>
<p>It should be said that, yes, sometimes, I do get a little caught up in
things with two cables hanging off me. If I could give one tip here it would
be that running the microphone cable up your trousers and shirt makes life a
ton easier. As a bonus I have the USB cable for the headset running around
the headset's strap and connected to it at the back and then running down my
back.</p>
<h1>OBS Studio</h1>
<p>The core software used is <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>. This has
got to be one of the best bits of free software I've ever used, in terms of
interface and what it delivers.</p>
<p>Years back my son used to record and upload gameplay to YouTube and I can
remember him having no end of issues using different recording software;
some working with one game but not another, some other working with a
different set of games, video and sync issues, etc... Lots of pain quite
often. With OBS Studio the only issues I've ever had have been my own
mistakes.</p>
<p>At this point I have to confess that when I set it up I didn't make a point
of keeping a recording of what I changed -- I was experimenting and not
expecting much to come of it. So what I note here are the things that feel
like they're important, and only the things that relate to recording PCVR,
not streaming it (that might end up being a different blog post).</p>
<p>That said, here are things I seem to remember as being key:</p>
<h2>Output Settings</h2>
<p>The items in the output pane in settings that I have and which might be
important are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Output Mode:</code> Simple</li>
<li><code>Recording Quality</code>: High Quality, Medium File Size</li>
<li><code>Recording format</code>: mkv</li>
<li><code>Encoder</code>: Hardware (NVENC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do remember the recording format being set to <code>mkv</code> as something that's
really important. I think it's <code>mp4</code> by default, or was when I first
installed, and if your machine crashes or OBS were to crash or something,
you could end up with footage that can't be used. Using <code>mkv</code> means you can
still use the footage (as I understand it). It does mean that once you're
finished you have to use the "remux" option under the <code>File</code> menu, but
that's a small price to pay.</p>
<p>I can say that at least once I've had to hard-reboot my machine when a game
and SteamVR and the like all got upset. I likely saved 45 minutes or more of
footage thanks to <code>mkv</code>.</p>
<h1>Video Settings</h1>
<p>Nothing really special in here, I simply have both the base and output
resolutions set to the desktop resolution. This <em>might</em> be something for me
to tinker with in the future, but so far I've not run into any problems.</p>
<h1>VR Capture</h1>
<p>Now, of course, all of the above is great and fine and all but there's the
issue of how you capture the VR gameplay. I approach this a couple of
different ways. The first is I use the <a href="https://github.com/baffler/OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin">OpenVR Capture plugin for
OBS</a>. This makes
capturing footage from SteamVR really easy. The only downside I found is
that out of the box there's no default crop setting for using a Quest 2 (or
I guess the Rift, as the Quest 2 sort of appears as a Rift to SteamVR
games). As such I remember playing trial and error with that until I was
happy I was getting as much footage as possible without having black bars
and the like.</p>
<p>Something I also like about the OpenVR Capture plugin is you can say if you
want to capture the left or right eye. Normally not that big a deal for some
things, but if you're playing a shooter and want people to see exactly what
your dominant eye is seeing, that matters.</p>
<p>Sadly, of course, not every game can be captured with that plugin. So far
I've found that any game that can't be has its own mirror window on the
desktop. In that case I use a <code>Game Capture</code> source and set it to capture
that specific window. I could of course just get it to capture the focused
window or something like that but I prefer to know that it's only grabbing
what I want it to grab.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>That's pretty much it I think. There's not a lot to it, although on occasion
a lot can go wrong. Mostly it's a wonder any of it works. I mean, think
about it, I have a computer with two screens strapped to my face, with two
controllers in my hands talking to it; it's then connected via the Oculus
Link to the Oculus Home; from which I start up SteamVR; and from the SteamVR
home I start up the game and then "live" inside the game. It's a virtual
world inside a virtual world inside a virtual world inside a real world;
with lots of software along the way, all talking at once.</p>
<p>That is then being recorded.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on occasion, it takes a reboot or five to make it all work
together.</p>
<p>Really, it's a wonder it ever works. ;-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I'm back! Almost. More or less. In more ways than one. First off, as often
happens with blogs (we've all been there right?), I've been away from
blogging for a while. I've still been online, still been waffling away <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">on
twitter</a>, and have also stumbled into
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep">fosstodon as well</a>. Doubtless plenty of other
things.</p>
<p>A big distraction for me, and one that is ongoing, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg">mucking about on
YouTube</a>. Since the last time I wrote
anything on the blog I got myself a VR setup, and then a PCVR setup, and
then finally fibre came to the village and I could stream, and... well, you
can see how that would go.</p>
<p>So, in short, that's where I've been and that's what's been keeping me busy.
Now that I'm paying some attention to blogging again (hopefully!) I imagine
some of that will end up on here -- I'd quite like to write about VR and
gaming amongst other things.</p>
<p>Now, I said I'd been away in more ways than one. Another way is explained by
<a href="/2019/10/18/time-to-move-on.html">this post from back in 2019</a>, where I
said I was going to head <a href="https://blog.davep.dev/">over to Hashnode</a> and
carry on blogging there, obviously with an emphasis on development and just
development.</p>
<p>That kept me busy for a while and worked out well, mostly. But... well, see
above in part; I sort of ran out of steam when it came to purely-development
topics. But I still wanted to write, a bit, and wanted to write about more
than just development.</p>
<p>Also, something else was bothering me about being over on Hashnode. In the
past year, in terms of what they promote themselves, especially blogs and
posts they promote on their Twitter feed, they seem to have started to lean
really hard into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g">crypto and web3 and
NFTs</a> and all that stuff. This
left me feeling like that was all a bit icky and it was time to put some
distance between that platform and myself.</p>
<p>So over the past couple of weeks, low-level and as a background task, I've
been back-porting posts from over there back into this blog. Starting with
this post all new blog content, be it about software development or anything
else, will be on here. If I'm really sensible and don't get distracted by
new shiny... this should be how it remains now.</p>
<p>Expect some changes over the next few weeks. While I'm aiming to stick with
the core tech (Github pages, Markdown and Jekyll, Emacs to edit, etc), I'd
like to tinker with the look and layout of the blog. The content will remain
the same though.</p>
<p>So, yeah, anyway, if you're reading this... hey, it's good to be back. :-)</p></div>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post will cover the most important content of a 2bit file: the actual
sequence data itself. In <a href="/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html">the first
post</a> I wrote about the format
of the file's header, and in <a href="/2020/09/05/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-index.html">the second
post</a> I wrote about
the content of the file's index.</p>
<p>At this point that's enough information to know what's in the file and where
to find it. In other words we know the list of sequences that live in the
file, and we know where each one is positioned within the file. So, assuming
we have our index in memory (ideally some sort of key/value store of
sequences names and their offsets in the file), given the name of a sequence
we can know where to go in the file to load up the data.</p>
<p>So the next obvious question is, what will we find when we get there? Actual
sequence data is stored like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Content</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>DNA size</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Count of bases in the sequence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N block count</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Count of N blocks in the sequence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N block starts</td>
<td>Integer Array</td>
<td>4*count bytes</td>
<td>Positions are zero-based</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N block sizes</td>
<td>Integer Array</td>
<td>4*count bytes</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mask block count</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Count of mask blocks in the sequence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mask block starts</td>
<td>Integer Array</td>
<td>4*count bytes</td>
<td>Positions are zero-based</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mask block sizes</td>
<td>Integer Array</td>
<td>4*count bytes</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reserved</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Should always be 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DNA data</td>
<td>Byte Array</td>
<td></td>
<td>See below</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Breaking the above down:</p>
<h1>N blocks</h1>
<p>As mentioned in passing in the first post: technically it's necessary to
encode 5 different characters for the bases in the sequences. As well as the
usual T, C, A and G, there also needs to be an N, which means the base is
unknown. Now, of course, you can't pack 5 states into two bits, so the 2bit
file format solves this by having an array of block positions and sizes
where any data in the actual DNA itself should be ignored and an <code>N</code> used in
its place.</p>
<h1>Mask blocks</h1>
<p>This is where my ignorance of bioinformatics shows, and where it's made very
obvious that I'm a software developer who likes to muck about with data and
data structures, but who doesn't always understand why they're used. I'm
actually not sure what purpose mask blocks serve in a 2bit file, but they
<em>do</em> affect the output. If a base falls within a mask block the value that
is output should be a lower-case letter, rather then upper-case.</p>
<h1>The DNA data</h1>
<p>So this is the fun bit, where the real data is stored. This should be viewed
as a sequence of bytes, each of which contains 4 bases (except for the last
byte, of course, which might contain 1, 2 or 3 depending on the size of the
sequence).</p>
<p>Each byte should be viewed as an array of 2 bit values, with the values
mapping like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Binary</th>
<th>Decimal</th>
<th>Base</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>00</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>G</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, given a byte whose value is <code>27</code>, you're looking at the sequence <code>TCAG</code>.
This is because <code>27</code> in binary is <code>00011011</code>, which breaks down as:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>00</th>
<th>01</th>
<th>10</th>
<th>11</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>G</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>How you pull that data out of the byte will depend on the language and what
it makes available for bit-twiddling; those that don't have some form of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field">bit field</a> will probably provide
the ability to bit shift and do a bitwise <code>and</code> (it's also likely that doing
bitwise operations is better than using bit fields anyway). In the version I
wrote in Emacs Lisp, it's simply a case of shifting the two bits I am
interested in over to the right of the byte and then performing a bitwise
and to get just its value. So, given an array called <code>2bit-bases</code> whose
content is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defconst</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">2bit-bases</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;T&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;C&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;A&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;G&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;Vector of the bases.</span>

<span class="s">Note that the positions of each base in the vector map to the 2bit decoding</span>
<span class="s">for them.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I use this bit of code to pull out the individual bases:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">aref</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">2bit-bases</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">logand</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">ash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">byte</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">shift</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mb">#b11</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Given code to unpack an individual byte, extracting all of the bases in a
sequence then becomes the act of having two loops, the outer loop being over
each byte in the file, the inner loop being over the positions within each
individual byte.</p>
<p>In pseudo-code, assuming that <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> hold the base locations
we're interested in and <code>dna_pos</code> is the location in the file where the DNA
starts, the main loop for unpacking the data looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">#</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">The</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">bases</span><span class="p">.</span>

<p>Note that some of the detail is left out in the above, especially the
business of loading up the relevant blocks; how that would be done will
depend on language and the approach to writing the code. The Emacs Lisp code
I've written has what I think is a fairly straightforward approach to it.
There's a similar approach in the <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-2bit">Common Lisp code I've
written</a>.</p>
<p>And that's pretty much it. There are a few other details that differ
depending on how this is approached, the language used, and other
considerations; one body of 2bit reader code that I've written attempts to
optimise how it does things as much as possible because it's capable of
reading the data locally or via ranged HTTP GETs from a web server; the
Common Lisp version I wrote still needs some work because I was having fun
getting back into Common Lisp; the Emacs Lisp version needs to try and keep
data as small as possible because it's working with buffers, not direct file
access.</p>
<p>Having got to know the format of 2bit files a fair bit, I'm adding this to
my list of "fun to do a version of" problems when getting to know a new
language, or even dabbling in a language I know.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>As mentioned in <a href="/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html">the first
post</a>, once you've read in the
header data for a 2bit file, the next step is to read the index. This is an
index into all the different sequences held in the file. Reading the index
itself is fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>The index comes right after the header -- so it starts on the 17th byte of
the file. Each entry in the index contains three items of information:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Content</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Name length</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>1 byte</td>
<td>How many bytes long the name is</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Varies</td>
<td>Length given by previous field</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Offset</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Location in the file of the sequence</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, in some sort of pseudo-code, you'd read in the index as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">index</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">dict</span><span class="ss">()</span>

<p>Note, as mentioned in the <a href="/2020/08/30/reading-2bit-files-for-fun.html">first
post</a>, the <code>index</code> will need to
be byte-swapped if the file is in an endian form other than the machine
you're running your code on. How you'd go about this will, of course, vary
from language to language, but the main idea is always going to be the same.</p>
<p>There's a fairly striking downside to this approach though: reading data can
often be an expensive (in terms of time) operation -- this is especially
true if the data is coming in from a remote machine, perhaps even one that's
being accessed over the Internet. As such, it's best if you can make as few
"trips" to the file as possible.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the best thing to do is to read the whole index into
memory in one go and then process it from there -- the idea being that
that's just one trip to the data source. The problem here, however, is that
there's nothing in the header or the index that tells you how large the
index actually is. What you can do though is work on the worst case scenario
(assuming memory will allow). The worst case is fairly easy to handle: it's
going to be 1 byte for the name length, plus 255 bytes for the name (the
longest possible name), plus 4 bytes for the offset; multiply all that by
the number of sequences in the index and you have the worst-case buffer
size.</p>
<p>When reading this data in you might also want to ensure you're not going to
run off the end of the file (perhaps the names are all quite small and so
are the sequences).</p>
<p>Recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/davep/2bit.el">a package for Emacs that can read data from
2bit files</a>, so here's the core code for
reading in the index:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">2bit--read-index</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="s">As a side effect </span><span class="ss">`2bit-data-pos&#39;</span><span class="s"> of SOURCE will move.&quot;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cl-loop</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="c1">;; The index will be a hash of sequence names, with the values being the</span>

<span class="w">   </span><span class="c1">;; We could read each name/value pair one by one, but because we&#39;re doing</span>

<p>This code does what I mention above: it grabs enough data into a buffer in
one go that I'll have the whole index in memory to pull apart, and then I
work with the in-memory copy. The index is added to a hashing dictionary.
Note that, in this case, I don't actually do the test for running off the
end of the file because at the heart of the file reading code is
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Reading-from-Files.html"><code>insert-file-contents-literally</code></a>
and it doesn't error if you request too much.</p>
<p>With that done you'll have a list of all the sequences in the file. The next
part, which will come in <a href="/2020/09/26/reading-2bit-files-for-fun-the-sequence.html">the next
post</a>,
is the properly tricky part: the decoding of the sequence data itself.</p></div>

      <div><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I've written a bit before about the value of having simple but interesting
"problems", that you know the solution to, as <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">a way of exercising yourself
in a new environment</a>. Recently I've
added another to the list I already have, and I used it as an excuse to get
back into writing <a href="https://github.com/davep/org-davep-2bit">some Common
Lisp</a>; and then went on to use it
as a reason to write <a href="(https://elisp.dev/)">yet another</a> package <a href="https://github.com/davep/2bit.el">for
Emacs</a>.</p>
<p>Having gone through the process of writing code to handle 2bit files twice
in about a month, and in two very similar but slightly different languages,
I thought it might be interesting for me to then use it to exercise my
ability to write blog posts (something I always struggle with -- I find
writing <em>very hard</em> on a number of levels) and especially posts that explain
a particular problem and how I implemented code relating to that problem.</p>
<p>Also, because the initial version of this post rambled on a bit too much and
I lost the ability to finish it, I'm starting again and will be breaking it
up a number of posts spanning a number of days -- perhaps even weeks -- so
that I don't feel too overwhelmed by the process of writing it. I will, of
course, make sure every post links to the other posts.</p>
<p>Now, before I go on, I'll make the important point that everything here is
written from the perspective of a software developer who happens to work as
part of a bioinformatics team; I don't do bioinformatics, I don't claim to
understand it, I just happen to sit with (well, used to sit with them --
hopefully we'll all make it back to the office one day!) and work with them,
and develop software that supports their work. Anything you see in any of
the posts that's wrong about that subject: that's just my ignorance being
shown through the lens of a software developer (all corrections are
welcome).</p>
<p>So, with all those disclaimers aside, I'm going to go on a slow wander
through what a 2bit file is, how you'd go about reading it, and related
issues. This isn't designed as a tutorial or anything like that, this is
simply me taking what I've learnt and writing it down. Perhaps someone else
will benefit one day, but the purpose is to simply enjoy cementing it in my
own mind and to enjoy the process of putting it all in writing.</p>
<h1>What is a "2bit file"?</h1>
<p>So what's this new "problem" I've added to my list? It's code to read
sequence data from <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7">2bit format
files</a>. For anyone who
doesn't know (<em>bioinformatics people look away now; a software developer is
going to explain one of your file formats</em>), this is a file format that is
intended to hold sequences in an efficient way. As I'm sure you know,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> is made up of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase">4
bases</a>, represented by the letters
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine"><code>T</code></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine"><code>C</code></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine"><code>A</code></a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"><code>G</code></a>. So, in the simplest case, we
could just represent a genome using those four letters. Simple enough,
right? Nice big text file with just those 4 letters in?</p>
<p>The thing is, something like the human genome is around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome#Molecular_organization_and_gene_content">3 billion bases in
length</a>.
That'd make for a petty big file to have to store and move around. So why
not compress it down a bit? That's where the 2bit format comes in.</p>
<p>Given this problem I'm sure most developers would quickly notice that, given
4 different characters, you only need 2 bits to actually hold them all (two
bits gets us <code>00</code>, <code>01</code>, <code>10</code> and <code>11</code>, so four different states). This
means with a little bit of coding you can store 4 bases in a single byte.
Just like that you've pretty much squished the whole thing down to 1/4 of
the original size. And that's more or less what the 2bit format does. If you
take a look at <a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/">the actual data for the human
genome</a> you'll see
that <code>hg38.2bit</code> is roughly 1/4 of 3 billion bytes, ish, give or take.</p>
<p>There is a wrinkle, however. There are parts of a genome where you might not
know what base is there. Generally <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html">an <code>N</code> is used for
that</a>. So, actually, we want
to be able to store 5 different characters. But 5 isn't going to go into 2
bits... Damn! Well, it's okay, 2bit has a solution to that too, and I'll
cover that later on.</p>
<h1>How is a 2bit file formatted?</h1>
<p>As you can see from <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7">the format information available
online</a>, a 2bit file is
a binary file format that is split into 3 key parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fixed size header with some key information</li>
<li>An index into the rest of the file</li>
<li>A series of records that contain actual sequence information</li>
</ul>
<p>In this first post I'll cover the details of the header. Subsequent posts
will cover the index and the actual sequence data records.</p>
<h2>The header</h2>
<p>The header of a 2bit file is fixed in size and contains some key
information. It can be broken down as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Content</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Signature</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>See below for endian issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Version</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Always 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sequence count</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reserved</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>4 bytes</td>
<td>Always ignored.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The signature value is used to test if what you're looking at is a 2bit
file, but also tells you some vital information about how to read the file
-- see below for more on that. The version value is always <code>0</code> -- as such
another useful test would be to error out if you get a valid signature but
get a version other than <code>0</code>. The sequence count is, as you'd guess, the
number of sequences that are held within the file -- this is important when
loading in the index of the file (more on that in the next post).</p>
<h2>The signature, big and little endianness, and byte swapping</h2>
<p>The header mentioned above comprises of 4 32-bit word values. The very first
word is important to how you read the rest of the file. This is the
<code>signature</code> for the 2bit file and it should always be <code>0x1A412743</code>. And this
is where it gets interesting and fun right away. The 2bit file format allows
for the fact that the file can be built in either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">a little-endian or a
big-endian machine</a>, and the
32-bit word values can be binary-written to the file in the local
architecture's byte order. The effect of this is that, from reading the very
first value in the file, you need to decide if every other numeric value you
read needs to be byte-swapped in some way. The early logic being (in no
particular language) something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">signature</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="nv">x1A412743</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">then</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">must_swap</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">False</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">byte_swap</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">signature</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="nv">x1A412743</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">then</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">must_swap</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">True</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">raise</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;This isn&#39;t a valid 2bit file&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Simply put, to read the rest of the file you will need a function that
byte-swaps a 32bit numeric value, and a flag of some sort to mark that you
need to do this every time you read such a value. Of course, depending on
your language of choice, you could do it in a number of different ways. In a
language like JavaScript or Scheme, where you can easily throw around
functions, I'd probably just assign the appropriate 32bit-word-reading
function to a global function name and call that regardless throughout the
rest of the code. In other languages I'd probably just check the flag each
time and call the swapping function if needed. In something like Python I'd
likely just use the signature to decide on which format to pass to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/struct.html#struct.unpack"><code>struct.unpack</code></a>.
For example, some variation on:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Assuming that &#39;header&#39; is the whole header of the file read as a binary buffer.</span>

<span class="n">word_fmt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">test_fmt</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;I&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&gt;I&quot;</span> <span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">struct</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unpack</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">test_fmt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">header</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">)[</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">0x1A412743</span>
        <span class="n">word_fmt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">test_fmt</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">word_fmt</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This isn&#39;t a 2bit file&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, the Python approach sort of hides the important detail here. With it
we'd simply use <code>struct.unpack</code>'s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/struct.html#byte-order-size-and-alignment">ability to handle different byte orders
</a>
and not worry about the detail. Which isn't fun, right? So how might code to
byte-swap a 32bit value look?</p>
<p>Assuming you've got the value as an actual numeric integer, it can be as
simple as using a bit of bitwise anding and shifting. Here's the basic code
I wrote in Common Lisp, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">swap-long</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;Swap the endianness of a long integer VALUE.&quot;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">logior</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">logand</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">ash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">-24</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">#xff</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">logand</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">ash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">-8</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">#xff00</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">logand</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">ash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">#xff0000</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">logand</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">ash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">#xff000000</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>JavaScript might be something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">swapLong</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

      <div><p>I first learnt Python back in the mid-to-late 90s, used it in place of Perl
once I was comfortable with it, and then we sort of drifted apart when I
first met Ruby. It's only in the last couple of years that I've got back
into it, and in a huge way, thanks to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">my (not-quite-so-) new
job</a>. Despite
the quirks and oddness (as I perceive them), I actually quite like Python
and it's one of those languages that just flows off my fingers. I'm sure you
know the same thing, perhaps not with Python, but there will be languages
that just flow for you, and those that take a bit more effort and
concentration. Python... feels okay to me.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that there's been a long-standing style guide. I quite
like <a href="python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> as a read, and think there's a
lot of good ideas in there; much of the content sits with how I'd approach
things if I was tasked to come up with such a document. With this in mind,
I'm a fairly heavy user of <code>pylint</code> and it in turn leans on PEP 8 (amongst
other things) and I'm happy to accept most of its judgements. Not all of its
judgements, <a href="/2019/11/04/my-pylint-shame.html">but even when I disagree with it I try and keep track of how
far I'm
drifting</a>.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely one hill I will happily die on when it comes to PEP
8: the concept of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements">"extraneous whitespace" in lists and
expressions</a>.
Just.... no! Oh gods no!</p>
<p>To borrow a line of code from <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">the journey problem I dabbled with a while
back</a>,
PEP 8 would have me write something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">commands</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">state</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, I'm sure plenty of people won't see a problem with this at all; but all
I can see is an almost-claustrophobic parameter list. What's with the
parameters being jammed up against the opening and closing parens? Why have
the dinky little comma lost between two different things? Why have it look
like a long stream of letters and punctuation? Why....</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just no.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly, I just need for the code to breathe a bit. When I type
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">commands</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="nb">str</span> <span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">State</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>suddenly if feels like there's fresh air in the code, like it flows gently
out of my head, off my fingers, through the keyboard and into the buffer.</p>
<p>In my head, and to my eyes, the code is.... relaxed.</p>
<p>Do I have a rational reason for this? Nope. Then again I don't see one for
doing it the other way either; I can't think of one and I don't see one in
the source document. So, that's a warning I always turn off with <code>pylint</code>
and it's a style I carry through all my Python code; and I think that's the
important point here: anyone reading and working with my code should see the
same style all the way through. It might differ from PEP 8 on this point,
but at least it's the same all the way.</p>
<p>And, really, that's okay: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds">PEP 8 is there to be
ignored</a>.
;-)</p>
<p>PS: This is a small part of another blog post I was meaning to write, and
might still do, about my (still ongoing) experience of getting
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode"><code>lsp-mode</code></a> up and running in Emacs
and having it play nice with Python projects. I have that working, but it
was a bit of a learning curve and epic battle over a couple of days, and one
that had me first encounter
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/"><code>pycodestyle</code></a>. I may still tell the
tale...</p></div>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>First a small aside: To be honest, the <code>T</code> part of <code>TIL</code> is getting to be
less and less true with this series of posts, but the posts themselves serve
a useful purpose for me. As I've been reading the book I'm working through,
I've also been making notes on my iPad in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109">Apple Notes
application</a>. I'm not
really convinced that that's the best final location for such notes, so
early on I made an extra step in keeping track of what I'm doing and trying
to reinforce what I'm learning: transfer the notes into
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> documents in my notebook repository.</p>
<p>This repository contains lots of Org-Mode files, broken down into subject
directories, that hang on to longer-form information I want to keep track of
regarding software development and general operating system use. I'm sure
you know the sort of thing, the things where you know you know them but you
can't always retain all the detail -- so having the detail where you know
you'll find it is useful.</p>
<p>So I've made that part of the process: read book, find thing worth noting,
note in Apple Notes, a wee while later re-read and test out by writing
sample code and transfer to the Org-Mode notebook. During that latter step I
sometimes also write up something that I really liked or found interesting
here to further reinforce the learning process.</p>
<p>The "TIL" I wanted to note quickly today is how happy I was to see that
Swift has something that's a reasonably recent addition to Emacs Lisp:
conditional binding. Skipping off into Emacs Lisp for a moment, it would be
very common for me to find myself writing something like this (this actually
happens in all languages really):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">get-something-from-elsewhere</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">foo</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">do-something-with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Quite simply: I'd get a value from elsewhere, that value could possibly be
<code>nil</code> to mark that there was a failure to get a value, but that failure
wasn't in any way fatal or even a problem worthy of note: I just needed to
skip along. But that binding followed by the test was always a little
jarring. And then, <a href="https://endlessparentheses.com/new-in-emacs-25-1-more-flow-control-macros.html">back in
25.1</a>,
<code>if-let</code> and <code>when-let</code> got added (of course, this being Lisp, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Macros.html#Macros">it would
have been very simple to add them
anyway</a>),
and it was easier to <a href="https://github.com/davep/pinboard.el/blob/d426f9d2ebec5f907c8a89d6b38ccbcb13750d4f/pinboard.el#L308">write the code so it looked just a little
nicer</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">when-let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">get-something-from-elsewhere</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">do-something-with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's a small difference, but I find it a pleasing one.</p>
<p>So of course I was pleased to find that Swift has something similar with
<code>if</code> and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional"><code>Optional</code></a>
values, where you can write something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">foo</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">getSomethingFromElsewhere</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do something with foo but only if it&#39;s not nil</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which means you can do things like this (not that I'd really do things like
this, but it was a handy test on the command line):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">oddRand</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">Int</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">n</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">Int</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="k">in</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">..</span><span class="mi">99</span> <span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">nil</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">..</span><span class="mi">10</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">n</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">oddRand</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Nope&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As usual... of course that's horrible code, it was just thrown together to
test/experience the language feature on the command line.</p>
<p>I like it though. I figure <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/when-let">all the best languages have conditional
binding</a>. ;-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This is one of those things, especially this little play to help appreciate
the feature, that I'm filing under "kinda cool, but I am <em>never</em> doing this
in production".</p>
<p>So Swift has operator overriding, and then some. Moreover, operators are, in
effect, functions, just with some extra syntax support. None of this is new
to me, I've worked in and with other languages that have this ability,
expect... I don't ever recall working in a language that, at the time I did,
supported creating brand new operators (okay, fine, Lisp is a bit of an
outlier here and there's all sorts of fun conversations to be had there --
but still, let's stick with more "conventional" syntax here). Support always
seemed to be about extending the ability of an existing operator.</p>
<p>Swift though... yeah, you get to pick from a huge character space when it
comes to creating operators.</p>
<p>Which got me thinking... How cool would it be to have a prefix operator that
turns a floating point number into a currency-friendly number (you know, the
sort of number type that can be used for currency-friendly calculations).</p>
<p>Swift has the
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/decimal"><code>decimal</code></a>
type which, at first glance anyway, looks to be a sensible candidate; even
if it isn't (and, really, how to actually sensibly handle currency is a
whole series of blog posts in their own right, that I have no wish to write
myself because such things are a previous working life for me, and other
people have doubtless done a very comprehensive job elsewhere over the
years) it will serve as a good stand-in for the little bit of horror I'm
going to write next.</p>
<p>So... Let's say we want to use <code>£</code> as a prefix operator to say "see this
number? make it a <code>decimal</code>", we could do something as simple as this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="nc">Foundation</span>

<span class="kr">prefix</span> <span class="kd">operator</span> <span class="err">£</span>
<span class="kr">prefix</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="mf">1.20</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="mf">0.75</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="mf">0.01</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Horrifically and delightfully, it works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>swift<span class="w"> </span>run
<span class="o">[</span><span class="m">3</span>/3<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span>Linking<span class="w"> </span>opover
<span class="m">1</span>.96
</code></pre></div>

<p>I know, I know, I feel bad for even trying. But it's also kinda cool that
the language has this.</p>
<p>It gets better though...</p>
<p>While reading up on what characters can and can't be used as operators, one
thing that stood out was the fact that, more or less, any character that
isn't a valid identifier can be used as an operator. So... hang on, we can
use "emoji" as identifiers?</p>
<p>Like this?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="nc">Foundation</span>

<span class="kr">prefix</span> <span class="kd">operator</span> <span class="err">£</span>
<span class="kr">prefix</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="err">💵</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="mf">1.20</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="mf">0.75</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="err">£</span><span class="mf">0.01</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="err">💵</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Why yes. Yes we can. 😈</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier this week something in my development environment, relating to
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, Python,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> and
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">pipenv</a>, got updated and broke a handful
of repositories. Not in a way that I couldn't recover from, just in a way
that was annoying, got in the way of my workflow, and needed attention.
<em>(note to self: how I set up for Python/Django development on a machine
might be a good post in the future)</em></p>
<p>Once I was sure what the fix was (pretty much: nuke the virtual environment
and recreate it with <code>pipenv</code>, being very explicit about the version of
Python to use) the next step was to figure out how many repositories were
affected; not all were and there wasn't an obvious pattern to it. What was
obvious was that the problem came down to <code>python</code> in the <code>.venv</code> directory
pointing to a binary that didn't exist any more.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png" src="/attachments/2020/07/10/Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 20.21.15.png"></p>
<p>So... tracking down problematic repositories would be simple enough, just
look for every instance of <code>.venv/bin/python</code> and be sure it points to
something rather than nothing; if it points to nothing I need to remake the
virtual environment.</p>
<p>I quickly knocked up a script that was based around looking over the results
of a <code>find</code>, and initially decided to use <code>file</code> to perform the test on
<code>python</code>. It seemed to make sense, as I wrote the script I checked the <code>man</code>
page for <code>file(1)</code> on macOS and sure enough, this exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-E On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that <code>file</code> dereferences links by default, that should get me an error
for a broken link, right? Bit hacky I guess, but it was the first thing that
came to mind for a quick bit of scripting and would do the trick. Only...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>-E<span class="w"> </span>does-not-exist

</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Wat</a>?!? But it's right there! It says so in the manual! <code>-E</code> is documented right in the manual page! And yet it's not in the valid switch list as put out by the command, <em>and</em> it's an <code>invalid option</code>. The hell?</p>
<p>So I go back and look at the <code>man</code> page again and then I notice it isn't in
the list of switches in the synopsis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br>
    file [-bcdDhiIkLnNprsvz] [--extension] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] [-P name=value] [-M magicfiles] file<br>
    file -C [-m magicfiles]<br>
    file [--help]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then did the obvious tests. Did I have <code>file</code> aliased in some way? No. Was
some other thing that works and acts like <code>file</code> in my path? No. Was I
absolutely 100% using <code>/usr/bin/file</code>? Yes.</p>
<p>Long story short: it seems the <code>man</code> page for <code>file</code>, on macOS, fibs about
what switches it supports; it says that <code>-E</code> is a valid option, but it's not
there.</p>
<p>What's even odder is the man page says it documents v5.04 of the command,
but <code>--version</code> reports v5.37. Meanwhile, if I check on a GNU/Linux box I
have access to, it does support <code>-E</code>, reports it in the switches, documents
it in the <code>man</code> page (in both the synopsis and in the main body of the page)
and it is v5.25 (and so is its man page).</p>
<p>So that was something like 20 minutes lost to a very small problem, for
which there was no real solution, but was time that had to be spent to get
to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>In the end I went with what I probably should have gone with in the first
place: <code>stat -L</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>venv<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>find<span class="w"> </span>.<span class="w"> </span>-name<span class="w"> </span>.venv<span class="k">)</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now I have that script in my <code>~/bin</code> directory, ready for the next time
Homebrew and friends conspire to throw my day off for a while.</p></div>
