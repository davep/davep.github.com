  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>Last week I was wrestling with some Textual code, trying to get something to
lay out on the screen "just so". On the whole this isn't too tricky at all,
and for those times where it might feel tricky <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/how-to/design-a-layout/">there's some advice
available on how to go about
it</a>. But in this case
I was trying to do a couple of "on the edge" things and one thing I really
needed to know was what particular part of the display was being "caused" by
what container or widget<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment anyway, Textual doesn't have a full-blown devtools with
all the bells and whistles; not like in your average web browser. It does
have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/">a devtools</a>, but not
with all the fancy DOM-diving stuff the above would have needed.</p>
<p>What I needed was the equivalent of <code>print</code>-debugging but with a
point-and-ask interface. Now, I actually <em>do</em> often do <code>print</code>-debugging
with Textual apps only I use
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/app/#textual.app.App.notify"><code>notify</code></a>;
this time though <code>notify</code> wasn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>I needed something that would let me point at a widget and say <em>"show me
stuff about this"</em>. Something that happens when the mouse hovers over a
widget. Something like... <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#tooltips">a
tooltip</a>!</p>
<p>So that was easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">widget</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span><span class="p">)]:</span>
        <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tooltip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="si">!r}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ancestors_with_self</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Suddenly I could hover my mouse over a bit of space on the screen and get a
"traceback" of sorts for what "caused" it.</p>
<p>I posted this little hack to <code>#show-and-tell</code> on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Discord
server</a> and someone mentioned it would be
handy if it also showed the CSS for the widget too. That was simple enough
because every widget has a <code>styles.css</code> property that is the CSS for the
widget, as a string.</p>
<p>After that I didn't think much more about it; until today.</p>
<p>Looking back, one thing I realised is that adding the CSS information
<code>on_mount</code> wasn't quite good enough, as it would only show me the state of
CSS when the mount happened, not at the moment I inspect the widget. I
needed the tooltip to be dynamic.</p>
<p>Thing is... Textual tooltips can't be functions (which would be the obvious
approach to make it dynamic); so there was no way to get this on-the-fly
behaviour I wanted.</p>
<p>Except there was! The type of
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/widget/#textual.widget.Widget.tooltip"><code>tooltip</code></a>
is <code>RenderableType</code>. So that means I could assign it an object that is a
Rich renderable; that in turn means I could write a <code>__rich__</code> method for a
class that wraps a widget and then reports back what it can see every time
it's called.</p>
<p>In other words, via one step of indirection, I could get the <em>"call a
function each time"</em> approach I was after!</p>
<p>It works a treat too.</p>
<p>All of which is a long-winded way of saying I now have a <code>print</code>-debug-level
DOM inspector tool for when I'm building applications with Textual:</p>
<p><img alt="textual-dominfo in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/15/textual-dominfo.png#centre"></p>
<p>If this sounds handy to you, you can grab the code too. Install it into your
development environment with <code>pip</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>textual-dominfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then attach it to your app or screen or some top-level widget you're
interested in via <code>on_mount</code>; for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">on_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">textual_dominfo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">DOMInfo</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">DOMInfo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">attach_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then hover away with that mouse cursor and inspect all the things!
Whatever you do though, <em>don't</em> make it part of your runtime, and don't keep
it installed; just make it a development dependency.</p>
<p>The source can be found <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-dominfo">over on
GitHub</a> and the package is, as
mentioned above, <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-dominfo">over on PyPi</a>.</p>

      <div><p>The idea for this one popped into my head while on the bus back from Textual
Towers this evening. So after dinner and some nonsense on TV I had to visit
my desk and do a quick hack.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown"><code>textual-countdown</code></a>, a
subtle but I think useful countdown widget for Textual applications.</p>
<p><img alt="Textual Countdown in action" src="/attachments/2024/01/11/textual-countdown.gif"></p>
<p>The idea is that you compose it somewhere into your screen, and when you
start the countdown the bar highlights and then starts to shrink down to
"nothing" in the middle of its display. When the countdown ends a message is
posted so you can then perform the task that was being waited for in an
event handler.</p>
<p>Not really a novel thing, I've seen this kind of thing before on the web;
I'm sure we all have. I just thought it would be a fun idea for Textual
applications too.</p>
<p>I envisage using this where, perhaps, an application needs to wait for an
API-visiting cooldown period, or perhaps as a subtle countdown for a
question in a quiz; something like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like it's something useful for your Textual
applications, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-countdown/">it's now available from
PyPi</a> and, of course, the
source is over <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown">on GitHub</a>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This is actually the second release of OSHit since <a href="/2024/01/01/oshit.html">I first announced it a
week back</a>, and I'll get to that other release in a
moment.</p>
<p>I've just published v0.2.0, which isn't a very substantial release, but
which bumps the required version of Textual to
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.1">v0.47.1</a> and
has some fun with <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.0">the new nested CSS
feature</a>.</p>
<p>Underlying the point of this release was me taking a <em>"real world"</em>
application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in
part to get a feel for how and when it's useful, but also to give it a
proper test in a <em>"proper"</em> application. In doing so <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3969">I think I've found one
bug</a>.</p>
<p>Dogfooding is always a good idea.</p>
<p>The main visible change in this release is I've played around with the look
of the comments dialog a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="OSHit you have comments" src="/attachments/2024/01/07/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I'm still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I
started out with.</p>
<p>Another change I made was also to the comments dialog. Before, if you
performed the <em>"expand comments"</em> action on a comment card that already had
its comments expanded, it would move focus to the first child comment; this
was a deliberate choice that felt right at the time. Having used the app for
a few days now I've realised that making it an open/close toggle is far more
useful. So that's what I've done.</p>
<p>Now... as for <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/releases/tag/v0.1.1">the previous
release</a> I mentioned
above. That was a fun one.</p>
<p>Back when I released v0.1.0 some joker decided that it would be fun to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38831083">submit the blog post about it to the Orange
Site</a>. The comments there
went as you'd expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph, ignoring the tool itself.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in self-reflective way.</li>
<li>Some riffed off the opening paragraph in a <em>"I never see the problem"</em>
  way.</li>
<li>One or two did the usual <em>"why even bother building that when
  <code>$TOOL_OF_CHOICE</code> exists?"</em> dance to show their terminal purity.</li>
<li>One or two posted genuinely useful links to other similar projects.</li>
<li>The biggest tree of comments was kind of a fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>One comment caught my eye though; someone reported having a problem running
it. My initial thought on reading it was <em>"my dude, seriously, you're going
to report the problem in some random comment on HN rather than raise an
issue with the author?!?"</em>.</p>
<p>For once <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues/2">I was wrong to be so cynical</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I'd been intentionally
reckless while writing the original code, and hadn't <a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit/pull/4">gone back to the API
code I'd written and made it behave</a>
before doing the initial release.</p>
<p>All of which is to say: if you run into a problem with some FOSS project, be
like <a href="https://github.com/mihaitodor">@mihaitodor</a>. Issue that thing so the
developer gets to know about it; don't assume they'll be reading some random
comment section, social media site or Discord server!</p>
<p>That and don't make 500+ HTTP requests at once; that might not end well for
some.</p></div>

      <div><p>I know I'm not alone in having a relationship with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">the orange
site</a> that is... weird. I generally dislike
the culture there, it's almost impossible to read any of the comments
without being frustrated about the industry I work in or am adjacent to and
some of the people who inhabit it; but as a link aggregator of stuff I might
find interesting... I honestly can't think of anywhere better. So, yes, I've
been a fairly avid reader of HackerNews for many years, and have even had an
account there for over 4 years.</p>
<p>Given this, for a wee while now, I've been meaning to knock up a
terminal-based client for it using
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a>.</p>
<p>So after work on <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a> settled down I got
the urge to start a new pet project (not abandoning Tinboard, I'm still
going to be tweaking and extending it of course) and finally knocking up
that client seemed like the one.</p>
<p><em>Orange Site Hit</em> is the result.</p>

This is a client built with <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">their own
API</a> and it doesn't provide such a thing;
at least not now and despite me seeing past promises that this will change,
there's no API for doing that sort of thing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea of this application is you can run it up in the terminal, check the
top, best and latest from the categories provided by the API, perhaps dive
off into your web browser if needed, and then got on with other things.</p>
<p>It's there for when you're in the terminal you just <em>need</em> your hit of the
orange site.</p>
<p>The main screen of the app revolves around the index of items, most of which
are going to be stories. You can see an example of that above. For people
who prefer things to be slightly less cramped, I've also added a "relaxed
layout" mode too:</p>
<p><img alt="The index in relaxed mode" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-index-relaxed.png"></p>
<p>From the index you can head off into your web-browser by hitting
<kbd>Enter</kbd> on any item; if the item is a story that links to somewhere
that link will be opened; if it's something more like <em>AskHN</em>, or a job,
it'll open the related page on HackerNews itself.</p>
<p>Pressing <kbd>u</kbd> with an item selected will let you view the details
for the user who posted the item:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the details of a user" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-user-dialog.png"></p>
<p>If you're the sort of person who wants to torture themselves by reading the
comments (oh come on we all do it!), there's a comment reader/navigator too.
With an item selected press <kbd>c</kbd> and the comment dialog will open:</p>
<p><img alt="Viewing the real meat of HackerNews" src="/attachments/2024/01/01/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the navigation within that dialog is fine; although I can see some
scope for improvement. At the moment it uses a widget-per-comment (actually,
it's at least 4 widgets per comment), which is fine and Textual handles that
without an issue, even on items with lots of comments, but longer-term I can
see me having some fun using <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#line-api">the line
API</a> to build a
super-efficient comment presentation and navigation widget.</p>
<p>That's it for now; it feels like a good v0.1.0 spot to be in. There are a
bunch of things I still want to do with it (better cleaning up of the text,
perhaps with some markup support so links get handled, etc; plus lots of
ways of searching for stuff), but I felt it was in a place where I could
start using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, it can be installed with
<code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/oshit/">from PyPi</a>. The
<a href="https://github.com/davep/oshit">source is available over on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <div><p>Although it's not planned this way, so far it looks like I'm on a "every
other day" release cycle with Tinboard right now! Today's release is a small
but handy one, I think.</p>
<p>Thanks to the handy little library
<a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip"><code>pyperclip</code></a> I've added:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to copy a bookmark's URL to the clipboard.</li>
<li>URL field autofill if you go to add a new bookmark and the clipboard
  appears to have a valid URL in it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The code for copying to the clipboard" src="/attachments/2023/12/25/copy-to-clipboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>At the moment the copy facility is just a straightforward copy of the URL,
nothing else. At some point I may add an extended copy option, which will
open a dialog with a bunch of options of what to copy from the bookmark, and
perhaps also how to format it or something. Like, often, if I'm copying a
bookmark's URL, it's because I want to paste it into some Markdown document,
or some location that will handle Markdown markup.</p>
<p>Perhaps that'll turn up in v0.5.0 in a couple of days? ;-)</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from

  <div>
      <div><p>It looks like I'm in a wee period of small incremental changes and release
of <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">Tinboard</a>. This morning I've release v0.3.0,
which has a couple of small but useful changes.</p>
<p>The first is more of a cosmetic thing. The <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/footer/"><code>Footer</code> widget in
Textual</a> is handy for showing
the current keyboard bindings in a given context, but it can get massively
cluttered very quickly (we do have plans to revisit this); in Tinboard this
clutter creep was turning into a thing.</p>
<p>So I've removed almost every binding from being displayed in the <code>Footer</code>,
and have placed an emphasis on the user pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> to get
context-sensitive help, and have also left the most useful bindings in the
footer with very minimal descriptions.</p>
<p>Given that this is a keyboard-first application, and I've tried to make the
bindings easy to remember, I think it's going to make more sense to do it
like this, and will make for a tidier UI too.</p>
<p>There is one disadvantage here of course: by removing the display of
bindings from the footer, the mouse-heavy user becomes disadvantaged; if a
particular binding doesn't have a UI feature that favours the mouse to cover
it too there's no way to initiate that action with the mouse. I'm going to
think on this a little. Again, Tinboard is designed for <em>me</em> first and
foremost, and my preference is to be keyboard-first when using the
application; but finding a good compromise would be advantageous when it
comes to advising people asking about Textual application design.</p>
<p>The second change is a simple but useful one. I've added a toggle of the
sort order of the tags menu in the left-hand column (bound to
<kbd>F4</kbd>). Right now it simply toggles between alphabetical order, or
bookmark count order (most to least). At some point I might make it more of
a cycle than a toggle, but this serves my purposes for now.</p>
<p>Tinboard can be installed with <code>pip</code> or (ideally) <code>pipx</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">from
PyPi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">source is available on

  <div>
      <div><p>Following on from <a href="/2023/12/19/tinboard.html">the initial full release a couple of days
ago</a>, I've just <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0">released v0.2.0 of
Tinboard</a>. There's
just one small change in this, but I think it's a really useful one.</p>
<p>In the top-left corner of the screen there's a menu of main filters, letting
you switch between seeing all bookmarks, or a combination of read, unread,
public, private, etc... In using the application I quickly realised that it
would be handy to have bookmark counts in that menu.</p>
<p>So I added that:</p>
<p><img alt="Counts in the filters menu" src="/attachments/2023/12/21/filters-menu.png#centre"></p>
<p>These counts are a little different from those in the tags list, in that
they always show the number of matching bookmarks amongst <em>all recorded
bookmarks</em>, not just those currently on display (and so subject to any sort
of filter that's in play).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this is the right approach here. I know for sure that that's what
I want from this, and I am writing this for me after all...</p>
<p>What's handy about this is that it makes it easier for me to see how many
bookmarks haven't been tagged, and also how many I haven't looked back over
and marked as read. This is already helping me get to untagged-zero.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new pet project, in part done
as a <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">Textual</a> "dogfooding" project, but
also because this is a tool I've been wanting for a while now: a
terminal-based client for the <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard bookmarking
service</a>.</p>
<p>The dogfooding side of the development has been helping, uncovering a couple
of fun bugs in Textual; plus the act of building this has let me try out a
few of the newer features we've recently added to the framework.</p>
<p>What's <em>really</em> important though is this is a tool I actually <strong>wanted</strong>,
and I'm using pretty often. I've written a <em>lot</em> of Textual-based
applications over the past year, most small examples, <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth">some quite a bit
bigger</a>, but none of them really
form part of my daily workflow. This changes with Tinboard.</p>
<p><img alt="Tinboard in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tinboard.png#centre"></p>
<p>Tinboard is designed as a fully-featured client, allowing for the creation
of new Bookmarks, complete with tag suggestion support:</p>
<p><img alt="Adding a new bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/new-bookmark.png#centre"></p>
<p>Not only are tag suggestions pulled from Pinboard, but entry of tags can
auto-complete, taking completions from both the suggested tags and also tags
used amongst your own bookmarks:</p>
<p><img alt="Auto-complete of tags" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/tag-suggest.gif#centre"></p>
<p>That feature was really easy to add thanks to <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/api/suggester/">the <code>Suggester</code>
API</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/09/21/textual-0380-adds-a-syntax-aware-textarea/">recently-added</a>
<code>TextArea</code> widget the add/edit dialog allows for proper full editing of the
extended text description of the bookmark too:</p>
<p><img alt="Editing a bookmark" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/edit.png#centre"></p>
<p>One caveat here is a lack of word-wrapping; but this will be arriving in an
update to Textual early in the new year.</p>
<p>As well as all the usual add/edit/delete facilities, Tinboard is also
designed to make it pretty easy to find bookmarks too. There are filtering
options for seeing all read/unread, public/private and tagged/untagged
bookmarks; this makes bookmark management really easy for me because I can
filter for all the untagged and private bookmarks, which are likely the ones
that need editing and expanding on, and tidy up my bookmark library.</p>
<p>There is also, of course, full text search too.</p>
<p><img alt="Text search entry" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-entry.png#centre"></p>
<p>When a filter or search is in operation, the related tags and the like react
too:</p>
<p><img alt="A search result being shown" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/search-result.png#centre"></p>
<p>Another thing I've made a point of doing in Tinboard is leaning pretty hard
on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/command_palette/">Command
Palette</a>. No
functionality is <em>only</em> available by it (I've done my best to make sure that
keyboard is the primary input device here, with keyboard shortcuts for as
much as possible). Initially I approached this as a "for the sake of
completeness" feature, but already I'm finding that it's a pretty quick
method of pulling up a tag filter.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette in action" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/command-palette.png#centre"></p>
<p>To help make all the features as discoverable possible, I've also ensured
there's a pretty comprehensive help screen:</p>
<p><img alt="Help" src="/attachments/2023/12/19/help.png#centre"></p>
<p>Anyway; that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out
and there's a few more things I'd like to add. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available <a href="https://github.com/davep/tinboard">via GitHub</a> and also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/">via
PyPi</a>. If you have an environment that
has <code>pipx</code> installed you should be able to get up and going with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>tinboard
</code></pre></div>

<p>I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Back in 2021, I think it was, when Value first announced the Steam Deck, I
was all <em>"hell yes sign me up!"</em>; like... really, I signed up there and then
to go on the waiting list. The idea of a wee device that would let me play a
ton of games in my Steam library seemed like a great idea. The price seemed
right too.</p>
<p>So, I signed up, and waited, and waited, and life moved on.</p>
<p>When I finally (I think it was the best part of 18 months later?) got the
email saying my Deck was up for grabs and did I want to complete the
purchase I... said nah. By this point I was <em>so</em> heavily into VR gaming that
mucking with stuff on a Deck didn't seem to make much sense to me any more.</p>
<p>I moved on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks back they announced the OLED version and I took a second
look. There was now over a year of reviews to read, hacks to notice, fun to
follow; now I could get an idea if a Deck was any good and if it was for me.
So after a bit of review-reading and review-watching, Thursday last week, I
slapped down an order; and by Tuesday the Deck turned up.</p>
<p><img alt="New Deck getting going" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/new-deck.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The overturning of my original decision to <em>not</em> buy came down to a couple
of things. The first was: I recognised that there were a lot of games in my
library, sometimes things I'd bought (often in a sale), sometimes things I'd
got as part of a Humble Bundle, that just never got played. This, I noticed,
was sort of down to an unfortunate relationship I'd developed with gaming.</p>
<p>See... VR has won me over. I <em>love</em> gaming in VR. Also, I love recording my
gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">throwing them on
YouTube</a>. This means that, to some
extent, in my head, there's <em>effort</em> to getting going with playing a game:
I've got to power up the Windows PC; I've got to let it update stuff; I've
got to let Steam update stuff; I've got to power up the VR headset; I've got
to get it to connect to the PC (which generally works fine but on occasion
needs a complete restart of everything); I need to decide what I'm playing
next and what to record; I've got to get the recording software going; I've
got to...</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Also, of course, I've got to be in the right state to be okay with having a
computer strapped to my face (sometimes you don't feel 100% and being lost
in a virtual world isn't the best thing to be doing).</p>
<p>This can feel like too much effort. It also means that gaming tends to be
left for when I've got a few hours to dedicate to it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But I also <em>love</em> playing games.</p>
<p>My thinking then was a Deck would be a great way of "forcing" myself to play
the more casual stuff. There's no easy (that I know of) way to record or
stream from the Deck; it's also easy to have it on the sofa and turn it on
in a moment. This felt like the ideal device to have to hand, that was
dedicated to gaming, and which would encourage me to take smaller gaming
sessions when the time arises.</p>
<p>Like... sometimes I'll put something on to cook, come into the living room,
pick up the tablet and scroll through the Internet. While I try not to
doom-scroll too much, I can see that it would be more healthy to pick up the
Deck and play DooM!</p>
<p>So far, two days in, I'm convinced this was an excellent idea and I'm
totally won over.</p>
<p><img alt="My Steam Deck and Stream Deck" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/IMG_3842.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I'm still getting a feel for what does and doesn't work best on the Deck,
from a <em>"my taste in games"</em> point of view, but things that allow for
dipping in and having a quick blast are winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/741510/The_Hong_Kong_Massacre/">Hong Kong Massacre</a>
has finally got a play, despite me owning it ever since I saw John Wick 4.</p>
<p><img alt="Hong Kong Massacre" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/hong-kong.jpg#centre"></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">DooM II</a> got installed
and is working well -- I may have to slowly play my way through the whole
thing. I've also installed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255070/Abyss_Odyssey/">Abyss
Odyssey</a> and so
far am finding it quite charming and fun (it's an example of a game that
isn't really my kind of thing; but I got it in a Humble Bundle, I think, and
it's been sat there with 0 hours for way too long).</p>
<p>I've also failed to resist one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/434050/Duke_Nukem_3D_20th_Anniversary_World_Tour/">more questionable titles from my
younger days</a>...</p>
<p><img alt="Come get some" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/duke.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The real surprise for me though has been a game I bought on a whim a couple
of weeks back, which was going cheap, looked fun, seemed nice and casual and
which I installed on the PC and totally ignored (because, again, turning on
the PC to have a quick game seems like a lot of faff):
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/">Brotato</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Brotato" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/brotato.jpg"></p>
<p>This game is frantic, way over the top, kinda confusing in parts (for me)
but accessible enough that I can actually have a ton of fun with it; and
what's really important is that I can pick up the Deck, turn it on, play a
game of this for 10 minutes and then go on to do the thing I needed to do
next. It's the <em>perfect</em> game to play while waiting for the next step in
dinner to cook.</p>
<p>So, yeah, The Steam Deck... I'm won over; I'm so won over. And I haven't
even properly explored the fact that it has a full GNU/Linux desktop inside
it that I can use as a desktop machine...</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Some of this is also true with gaming on the PS5; while it's easier to
turn on and get going, and while I don't have a VR setup for it, I do
have it in my head that it's more for "epic gaming" than quick casual
stuff; see <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/">Death Stranding</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU">Cyberpunk

<p>One of the devices I was late to, but won over by, after moving away from
Android to iPhone, was the Apple Watch. These days I have two: the original
SE, and also a Series 8. Generally I've marvelled at just how seamless the
experience is. I swap watches: the connection to my phone "just works" and
it figures all that out. Stuff syncs. Stuff stays in sync.</p>
<p>I lean heavily on the watch. The Series 8 is my daily driver, and the SE
acts as my nighttime tracking device while the 8 charges and I sleep.</p>
<p>I record walks. I record runs. I record lots of heart rate data. I pay for
things, pretty much everything, with it. I... take it for granted really.</p>
<p><img alt="My main watch face" src="/attachments/2023/12/08/watch-face.png#centre"></p>
<p>Yesterday though, something odd started to happen. I noticed that some
things didn't seem to be syncing from my watch to the phone. Health-related
things weren't turning up. A recorded workout didn't show. The control of
all things audio seemed to decouple and the watch kept taking over use of my
AirPods from the phone in an annoying way I'd never experienced before.
Things like that.</p>
<p>I tried a reboot of the watch. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again. I tried a reboot of the phone. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again.</p>
<p>I then rebooted watch and phone, stuff seemed fine, and I didn't think much
more about it.</p>
<p>Then this morning I swapped from the SE back to the Series 8 as I sat down
for breakfast, my usual routine, and the syncing was failing <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>This, for me, this is when Apple stuff gets really frustrating. There's no
easy or obvious way to diagnose what's going on. Like: I could not sync some
health data from the watch to the phone, but I <em>could</em> use "Find My" to ping
the watch (presumably a difference in communication route, BT vs Wi-Fi
perhaps). There's no obvious error dialog. There's no obvious log to look
at. There's no "your BT is borked" alert or something.</p>
<p>Searching online the advice seemed to be the nuclear option: unpair the
watch, reset it, start again. So I've done that this morning and it's been
quite the pain. Getting it set up again was straightforward enough, but
having to go through the whole thing of dismissing all the <em>"here's some
tips on how to use this watch you've had for a year and used every day"</em>
cards was annoying, also having to set up my payment cards again was
annoying. Also, and this is on me for not backing them up recently, trying
to recreate my watch faces from memory and remembering which ones they were
based on was also annoying.</p>
<p>Apple are actually so good at a lot of this seamless shit; but damn do I
wish they'd also be good at making a tool that lets you easily and smoothly
diagnose some issues. I would imagine sync issues between watch and phone
are common enough that a wee tool where you run through diagnostics, and
where there's a Q&amp;A to help narrow down the issue, would be a great
experience.</p>
<p>Anyway... it seems to be up and running again, so hopefully that's that
issue solved. I tried a couple of things that would need to sync from the
watch to the phone and they showed up instantly; actually faster than I've
been used to for quite a while.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed...</p>
