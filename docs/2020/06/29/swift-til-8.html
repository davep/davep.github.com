  <div>
    <p>Although I read up on it a few days back, it was only this evening that I
fired up Emacs (well of course I'm testing Swift with Emacs, what did you
think I'd do?!?) and dabbled with some code to really get a feel for how
casting works in Swift.</p>
<p>Swift seems to be one of those languages that does it with a keyword rather
than a non-keyword approach. The two main keywords being <code>as?</code> and <code>as!</code>. I
kind of like how there's a polite version and a bossy version. Having the
two makes a lot of sense from what I read too.</p>
<p>To try and illustrate my understanding so far (and do keep in mind I'm not
writing this with the express purpose of explaining it to anyone else -- I'm
writing this to try and retain it all in my head by working through it),
here's a bit of utterly pointless and highly-contrived code that defines
three classes in a fairly ordinary hierarchy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Animal</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Dog</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Cat</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">beAdorable</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Purrrrrr!&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, so far, so good: we have animals, we have dogs which are a kind of
animal, and we have cats, which are also a kind of animal, but they have the
special ability of actually being adorable. ðŸ˜¼</p>
<p>Now, for the purposes of just testing all of this out, here's a horrible
function that makes little sense other than for testing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">adore</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">as</span><span class="p">!</span> <span class="n">Cat</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="n">beAdorable</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Given an animal, it forces it to be a cat (by casting it with <code>as!</code>), and
then asks it to be adorable (because, of course, cats always do as they're
asked).</p>
<p>So, if we then had:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">adore</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">Cat</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>we'd get what we expect when run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Purrrrrr!
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good. But what about:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">adore</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">Dog</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Yeah, that's not so good:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/d/p/s/casting$<span class="w"> </span>swift<span class="w"> </span>run
<span class="o">[</span><span class="m">3</span>/3<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span>Linking<span class="w"> </span>casting
Could<span class="w"> </span>not<span class="w"> </span>cast<span class="w"> </span>value<span class="w"> </span>of<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;casting.Dog&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">(</span>0x10a1f8830<span class="o">)</span><span class="w"> </span>to<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;casting.Cat&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">(</span>0x10a1f88c0<span class="o">)</span>.
fish:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;swift run&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span>terminated<span class="w"> </span>by<span class="w"> </span>signal<span class="w"> </span>SIGABRT<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">(</span>Abort<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One way around this would be to use <code>as?</code>, which has the effect of casting
the result to an
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional"><code>Optional</code></a>. This
means I can re-write the <code>adore</code> function like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">adore</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">as</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="n">Cat</span> <span class="p">)?.</span><span class="n">beAdorable</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, if <code>a</code> can be cast to a <code>Cat</code>, you get an optional that wraps the
<code>Cat</code>, otherwise you get an optional that wraps <code>nil</code> (hence the second <code>?</code>
before attempting to call the <code>beAdorable</code> member function).</p>
<p>So now, if I run the problematic dog call above again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/d/p/s/casting$<span class="w"> </span>swift<span class="w"> </span>run
<span class="o">[</span><span class="m">3</span>/3<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span>Linking<span class="w"> </span>casting
</code></pre></div>

<p>In other words, no output at all. Which is the idea here.</p>
<p>I think I like this, I think it makes sense, and I think I can see why both
<code>as!</code> and <code>as?</code> exist. The latter also means, of course, that you can do
something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">adore</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">cat</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">as</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="n">Cat</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">cat</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">nil</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">cat</span><span class="p">!.</span><span class="n">beAdorable</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;That totally wasn&#39;t a cat&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>which, in the messy dog call again, now results in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/d/p/s/casting$<span class="w"> </span>swift<span class="w"> </span>run
<span class="o">[</span><span class="m">3</span>/3<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span>Linking<span class="w"> </span>casting
That<span class="w"> </span>totally<span class="w"> </span>wasn<span class="err">&#39;</span>t<span class="w"> </span>a<span class="w"> </span>cat
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or, of course, the same effect could be had with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">adore</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">Cat</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">as</span><span class="p">!</span> <span class="n">Cat</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="n">beAdorable</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;That totally wasn&#39;t a cat&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It should be stressed, of course, that the example code is terrible design,
so given the above I'd ensure I never end up in this sort of situation in
the first place. But for the purposes of writing and compiling and running
code and seeing what the different situations result in, it helped.</p>
