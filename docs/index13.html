      Posted on 2016-05-26 12:28 +0100 in <a href="https://blog.davep.org/category/emacs.html">Emacs</a>

  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>As I've mentioned elsewhere on this blog, over the past few years, my
use of GNU emacs has lapsed somewhat. There was a time when it was my
only editor (except for the odd dips into vim to do some quick
editing) and, back when I used to use GNU Linux as a desktop machine a
lot, I'd have an emacs session up and running pretty much non-stop (it
was one of the reasons I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/davep/uptimes.el">uptimes.el</a>).</p>
<p>In more recent times I've been working more on Windows and often
inside Visual Studio. Even for my own "for fun" programming, I've
mostly being doing things that didn't involve emacs much. In fact,
most of my recent "for fun" coding has been done using
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> because it was powerful,
cross-platform and also had great support for
<a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal">the language I code in a lot when it comes to personal amusement projects</a>.</p>
<p>During that time I've wanted to get back into emacs. Quite a bit seems
to have changed since I was last a very avid user and this also meant
wanting and needing to catch up.</p>
<p>The first thing I needed to do was finally get around to killing off
my old <code>~/.emacs</code> file. This has followed me around since I first got
into emacs on OS/2 back in the mid 1990s. The file started out with a
few <code>setq</code> expressions to tweak some settings and just kept growing
and growing. It'd got to a point where there was old stuff in there
that I had no use for and sometimes even no idea what it was
for. Heck, to give some idea of how old the file was: there were items
in there that handled running emacs on MS-DOS!</p>
<p>So, a couple of weeks back, I dumped it. Dumped the whole lot. The
plan then was to recreate it with as little hands-on coding as
possible. I decided that, as much as I could, I'd tweak using
<code>customize</code> and only hand-code (in <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> this time
around) things when there was no obvious other way to do it.</p>
<p>So far this is working out really well. Gone has the ugly and
monolithic <code>.emacs</code>, replaced with something far more modular, much
more tidy and far easier to maintain. Whereas my old config was almost
1,000 lines long, the new <code>init.el</code> is currently just 50 lines:</p>

<p>All the other stuff, things to tweak language modes so they indent
"just so", my own special keyboard bindings, that sort of thing,
they're all farmed off into their own files:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Another thing I'm trying to do is dump all the old third party code I
had locally and, instead, use emacs' own package manager
now. Currently this is also working well for me given that I'm using
both <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/">ELPA</a> and <a href="https://melpa.org/#/">MELPA</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't managed to dump everything yet, but it's a useful exercise
to slowly work through the various files I was carting around and
deciding if I need them or not (like, I'm fairly sure I won't be
needing a <code>cobol-mode</code> any time soon -- that can go).</p>
<p>On top of all of this, on top of starting with a "clean slate" emacs,
I've also started keeping track of what I do on GitHub. I've got a
private repo for my <code>~/.emacs.d/</code> that I can now easily sync between
my various machines.</p>
<p>One final thing that I'm starting to try and do is actually make full
use of emacs again. One example is that I'm writing this blog post in
it. Until now I've been using SublimeText with
<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll">a Jekyll package to compose and manage things</a>
but, this time around I'm giving <a href="https://melpa.org/#/hyde">hyde</a> and
<a href="https://melpa.org/#/markdown-mode">markdown-mode</a> a go. So far
they're working out pretty well too (albeit hyde was a bit odd to set
up and isn't 100% making sense to me yet).</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I've had my iMac for about 10 months now and I can safely say that it's a
purchase I don't regret. While I'm still not convinced by the hype and nonsense
that's normally associated with Apple products -- I've had plenty of moments
where the damn thing really hasn't "just worked" -- I really do like the iMac
as a Unix workstation.</p>
<p>Recently I've had the need to consider buying a small laptop that I can use
on train journeys. While I have a very capable Windows laptop it's a little
too large to pull out and use on the tray you get on the back of a train seat.
I also have a much-loved Chromebook but it would generally fail me on the train
unless I always pay for the WiFi. So the ideal machine for me would be fairly
small (no more than 12" or so), be capable of doing things locally, and would
also need a pretty good battery life (while the trains I travel on do provide
sockets they seem to provide no power as often as they do).</p>
<p>I did start to think about going with some sort of Macbook but, every time I
looked at them, I ended up deciding they were too expensive.</p>
<p>Until yesterday. Yesterday I found that the local computer store had the
13" Macbook Air on sale -- £150 off the usual price plus another £50 off if
I got there and bought it before 5pm.</p>
<p>So I had to go and look.</p>
<p>Having looked I came away with one.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Macbook, on the train" src="/attachments/2016/04/28/IMG_20160428_200405.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm very pleased with it. While the one I have is the lower spec
version (just 128GB of SSD and 4GB of memory) it seems to work well for my
needs.</p>
<p>As for what my needs are? I want to be able to work on web projects locally,
hack on JavaScript and HTML, that sort of thing. As well as that I want to
be able to run Git and, when I do have a net connection, sync to GitHub
and browse the web, do email, faff around on reddit, etc.</p>
<p>For this it's perfect. I'm finding it more than fast enough for what I want
(I'd even go so far as to say that it's faster than the iMac). The keyboard is
just the right size, the trackpad is perfect (and works just like the Magic
Trackpad I use on my iMac), the screen is very readable. So far I'm struggling
to find any real fault with it.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, there are some obvious downsides, the main one being that, for
what I paid for this, I could probably have got a lower-end gaming Windows
laptop with plenty of drive space, memory and a good graphics card. But that's
not what I was after. A machine that big and that powerful would sit in the
laptop bag and not get used. I wanted a machine that was easy to drag out,
open up and use.</p>
<p>And that's what's happening with the Air. In fact, it's being used on the
train right now; that's where I'm waffling on about this, to kill time,
somewhere north of Newcastle, with the sea to my right and the snow coming down.</p></div>

      <div><p>Now and again Google seem to actually listen. While they do generally have a
bad habit of removing things from things and saying it's for everyone's good
(because options are bad and they can't maintain them, apparently) it seems
they <em>can</em> do the odd turnaround now and again.</p>
<p>One thing they removed from Android recently was the
"<a href="/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html">until next alarm</a>""
option when putting a device in "do not disturb" mode.</p>
<p>Seems they've added that back in 6.0.1:</p>
<p><img alt="Google sees sense" src="/attachments/2015/12/17/Screenshot_20151217-112015.png"></p>
<p>It's a small thing, but it makes so much more sense and makes things so much
easier (even if it's a trivial thing).</p>
<p>Nice one Google. More of this please.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Until I moved about a year ago I'd always used Demon Internet as my ISP. I
stated with them during the old tenner-a-month days when there were only a
handful of points-of-presence to be called. I stuck with them through them
getting full local POP coverage, through having an ISDN line and then finally
ADSL.</p>
<p>When I moved though I decided it might be easier to just go with BT; for the
most part this hasn't actually been a bad decision. This week though I suffered
my first proper outage with them and it was rather frustrating.</p>
<p>It kicked off at around 2015-11-16 21:00. I noticed that Google Drive (in
Chrome) was complaining that it was offline. I then noticed that gmail and
a couple of other tabs in Chrome were complaining about the same thing. I
did a couple of local network checks and found nothing, checked the router and
it was connected and reporting just fine, so then I rebooted the router and
things appeared to improve.</p>
<p>For a short while anyway. Then I started to notice other problems; mostly that
some sites would time out, others not. Initially I was getting a lot of DNS
timeouts and, while I normally use Google's DNS servers (BT's have long had
lots of problems<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>), I tried switching back to BT's own and that appeared
to improve matters. For a while anyway.</p>
<p>I mentioned the issues on twitter and got a handful of replies from different
people running into similar issues. It was clear that this wasn't just me. I
then went looking for BT's broadband status page but hilariously was unable
to load it because of the problem.</p>
<p>This is my first bit of real frustration with them. Here's how the page
looks inside a desktop browser:</p>
<p><img alt="Status in desktop browser" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-18 at 10.42.40.png"></p>
<p>Now compare it as seen inside Android Chrome on my Nexus 6:</p>
<p><img alt="Status on my phone" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screenshot_20151118-104156.png"></p>
<p>Apparently they have decided that I'd never want to be able to check why my
broadband might be down, from a mobile device. Yes, sure, there's the option
to put my phone number in -- perhaps it tells me after I've done that -- but
I don't even know my land line number; I don't use it as a phone most of the
time and so never bother remembering it. The main point here is why the hell
wouldn't they include the same useful information as the desktop view? Or
perhaps use geolocation of the phone to narrow things down if they feel the
need.</p>
<p>Anyway, I gave up and went to bed. In the morning things were no better but,
after another router reboot, I did manage to get a view of the status:</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to see broadband status" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 10.29.47.png"></p>
<p>Finally! Acknowledgement of the problem. Worryingly though it was dated almost
12 hours after I first noticed the problem. From what I can see that date and
time isn't the date and time the status was last updated, it's the date and
time it was first added. That suggest that they really hadn't noticed the
problem all night. It's not like it was a problem that was hard to notice,
at least from a customer's point of view. Check this graph from a <a href="http://downdetector.co.uk/problems/bt-british-telecom">down
detector site</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="It really was down" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 10.27.07.png"></p>
<p>You'd think that a company as big as BT would have something in place that could
catch network problems, especially ones that are able to be caught with a simple
crowdsourcing "press this button if you have a problem" approach.</p>
<p>But... nope. Appears not. O_o</p>
<p>Anyway, a couple or so hours later the problem was finally fixed:</p>
<p><img alt="Finally got to see broadband status" src="/attachments/2015/11/18/Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 13.01.00.png"></p>
<p>(Notice how the date and time is the same as earlier; so 100% not an update time
but a first-added time) I mentioned this on twitter:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like BT broadband problems are resolved. Everything working that I can see, and this... <a href="https://t.co/m5Mo7vm5Yu">pic.twitter.com/m5Mo7vm5Yu</a></p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/666602185233440768">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>and I even got a reply (which I'd not gone looking for, so that was nice):</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">@davepdotorg</a> Yes Dave we have the problem fixed, if you still notice a few issues then reset the hub and try again. ^Chris</p>&mdash; BT (@BTCare) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare/status/666642010045050880">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<p>Curious as to why it'd take almost 12 hours from the problem appearing to it
being acknowledged on their status, I thought I'd ask:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare">@BTCare</a> All looking good. Any reason why it took 12 hours to acknowledge?</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/666642201783480320">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<p>which got this reply:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">@davepdotorg</a> Sorry it took so long, identifing the source of the problems would have taken some time. ^Shane</p>&mdash; BT (@BTCare) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCare/status/666666833148268548">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p></center></p>
<p>which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. Sure, you to spend time
identifying the source of a problem to <em>fix</em> it, but you don't need to do that
to notice and acknowledge that there's a problem. I've asked again but
haven't received any sort of reply as of the time of writing (I'm not expecting
one really).</p>
<p>What I take from all of this is that BT are shockingly bad at keeping people
informed of problems with their service when there's a large outage. I find
that kind of annoying. I don't mind that there are problems, I do mind when
a company can't take the time to clearly and quickly state "yup, it's us, it's
not you, we're looking into it..."</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Earlier on today I needed a copy of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"><code>wget</code></a> on my iMac. It's not "native" to
it so I got to wondering how you go about getting something like that onto it.
Sure, I could have just grabbed the source and built myself, but really it's
a lot nicer to use some sort of package manager.</p>
<p>A quick search lead me to <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and I was then up and
running in no time.</p>
<p>This in turn got me to thinking about how it might be fun to get some of the
software I used to use on my GNU/Linux machine up and running again. The first
one that came to mind was <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/"><code>slrn</code></a>. Sure enough
slrn is available via Homebrew and installing it was dead simple.</p>
<p>But then I was faced with a problem: I needed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">NNTP</a> server.
Way back I used to run a local one in my office that fed from and to my
ISP's. Back then my ISP was Demon Internet; these days I'm with BT. A quick
search lead me to an article or two that BT had a NNTP server, of sorts,
provided by a third party. So I did a quick check:</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Yay! This looked good.</p>
<p>After that I fired up <code>slrn</code> and.... problems. It kept asking me to log in,
to provide a user name and password. The only problem was that I'd read in more
than one place that a user name and password weren't needed for BT's server;
all that was required was you be on a BT IP address. Checking the slrn docs
I found <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-manual-6.html#ss6.32"><code>force_authentication</code></a>
but ensuring that was off made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point I removed <code>slrn</code> and gave up.</p>
<p>Later, thinking it might be an issue with just <code>slrn</code> and perhaps it was worth
trying a native NNTP client, I grabbed Unison
(<a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">which is no longer supported</a>
but seems to work fine). I got that set up and ran into the same issue: it
wanted login details.</p>
<p>Finally, after a bit more digging, I stumbled on the reason why I was struggling
to make any of this work: <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51205/?s_cid=con_FURL_giganews">BT had closed support for the server back in
December last year</a>!</p>
<p>A quick search around the web and I stumbled on <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org/">Eternal September</a>.
Given all I was interested in was the good old text groups this looked perfect.
I quickly registered an account, ran up Unison again and plugged in my details
and....</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.19.17.png"></p>
<p>Now that's all sorted I should try again with <code>slrn</code>. At which point I'll need
to drag out and tidy up <code>post.el</code> (<a href="http://post-mode.sourceforge.net/">the version that was being maintained
by some other people seems to have gone very stale</a>, sadly).</p></div>

      <div><p>I actually can't remember when the change was now, it was either Android 5.0
or one of the 5.x point releases, but I can recall the frustration of Google
having changed how you make an Android device silent, or not. The idea seemed
clever enough but it was a real pain to switch to and use. Previously there'd
simply been this neat system of setting he volume to either be some non-off
value, vibrate or totally silent. I even had a neat little widget on the home
screen of my phone to allow me to toggle between these 3 states.</p>
<p>It was simple, and worked well.</p>
<p>The new system though.... ugh. It was confusing and so much more long-winded
to work with.</p>
<p>At some point though they added one big redeeming feature: "Until next alarm".
When I got into bed I could tell my tablet to go totally silent until my
alarm went off in the morning, and then it would all work as normal. That was
an utterly brilliant idea.</p>
<p>So it made sense that if they changed anything about this in Marshmallow they'd
keep that in and make it even more awesome, right? Right?!?</p>
<p><img alt="Nope" src="/attachments/2015/11/12/Screenshot_20151112-140600.png"></p>
<p>Well fuck!</p>
<p>Why? Just..... why?!? I actually prefer how the new one works. They've more or
less solved the problem of how it was more faff to deal with, they've solved
the problem of having to cock about with the volume rocker to get at the
settings and then set the settings. I like all that.</p>
<p>But taking "Until next alarm" away? That's just nuts.</p>
<p>Sometimes I really get the impression that the Android developers are like the
Chrome OS developers: they're having a ton of fun improving and onward developing
the system but they have little connection to how people actually use this stuff.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's been quite a while since I used voiced search on my Nexus 6. Ever since
I got the Moto 360 I've not really had a need to say "OK Google" to my phone
because I could simply say it to my wrist. Today though, because I wanted to
quickly look something up and my phone was to hand, I spoke to it and got this:</p>
<p><img alt="Voice search fail" src="/attachments/2015/11/11/Screenshot_20151111-154157.png"></p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've been here before. I had <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts/fP9kdADZPQ9">exactly this sort of problem with my Xperia Z
at one point</a>.
The problem appeared to go away eventually (actually, it sort of came and
went a few times over a matter of weeks, if I recall correctly), although I
never really got to the bottom of the cause.</p>
<p>I've tried rebooting the phone and that hasn't helped at all. While it's more
of a vague annoyance than anything else (like I say above, my Android Wear
device is my goto tool for talking to Google these days) it does frustrate a
little when fairly expensive tools don't "just work".</p></div>

      <div><p>This just turned up in email a little earlier:</p>
<p><img alt="Yay! Spam!" src="/attachments/2015/11/06/Screen Shot 2015-11-06 at 13.16.30.png"></p>
<p>What's of particular interest is the email address this was sent to. It was
one that I only ever (to my knowledge) used for posts to Usenet. While my
gmail spam folder is filled with emails to that and other addresses I used
for Usenet over the years this is the first bit of "proper" spam I've had
to it in a long time.</p>
<p>It's signficant that it's some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBase">Xbase</a>-related
thing too. I think the Usenet group I posted to more than any other will have
been <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>. Unless I had some lapse of
judgement at some point in the late 1990s or early 2000s (I think I only got
the davep.org domain in 1999, now I think about it) the address this was sent
to was used nowhere else.</p>
<p>I've also never been a "Visual Objects and/or Vulcan.NET user". While I did
once own a copy of Visual Objects (two copies actually -- a beta and then a
final release) it wasn't in a way that I'd have been on some mailing list and
even if I had the address in question wouldn't have been the one used.</p>
<p>So, yeah, great way to impress me with a new product: make your first contact
with me look exactly like some old Usenet spam.</p>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> I've since had it confrimed by the sender of the email that
my address was indeed pulled from <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>.</p></div>

      <div><p>A little earlier today I decided it was time that I read up a little more about
the abilities of OS X's Spotlight facility. I use it a little -- it's a handy
tool to get at some often-used applications that I don't really need laying
around in the dock -- but I was starting to wonder if I could get more out of
it.</p>
<p>The obvious first place to look was in the HelpViewer; all the information I'm
ever going to need will be on the local machine, right?</p>
<p>So I open the HelpViewer, from the Spotlight bar, and type in that I want
information about Spotlight. The page comes up blank. The page was pretty small
so, while I pondered why it might be blank, I resized it and it disappeared!
I tried to open it again and.... nothing. Nothing I did would make the
HelpViewer show again.</p>
<p>I then tried following the advice
<a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Troubleshooting_Help_Viewer">on this page</a> but
none of that appeared to help. I then looked for the HelpViewer in the
Activity Monitor and killed it with that.</p>
<p>Running it again after that got me back to where I started. I tried the while
process again and, sure enough, trying to resize the window made it disappear.
I can make it happen every single time:</p>
<p><center></p>
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/id9Gb8SDYrg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></center></p>
<p>So it looks like another fine example of the Apple "it just works" thing.
For "doesn't always just work" values of "just works".</p></div>

      <div><p>As much as I like my iMac, and as much as I am generally impressed with OS X
the more I use it, I'm constantly frustrated by the little issues I run into
that make life so much more interesting and which fly in the face of the
"it just works with Apple" fandom thing. The more I use the iMac, the more I
appreciate that Macs and OS X are just as "fun" as anything running Windows.</p>
<p>A little earlier was a good example. I wanted to share part of the iMac's
filesystem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">SMB</a>.
This seemed easy enough, the instructions on how to do it were clear and,
after following them, it utterly failed.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>So I Googled the issue a bit and ran into
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6629743?start=0&amp;tstart=0">this handy forum post</a>.
Apparently you can't actually connect with SMB if the account you're going to
be using to connect with is using iCloud login rather than a separate login.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Not an obvious thing. Nothing said this was the case. According to the forum
post even Apple couldn't help the person who'd been trying to make it work.
But at least there was a workaround. All I'd need to do is split the password,
have a login for the machine that <em>wasn't</em> the iCloud login and I'd be all good.</p>
<p>I did it, it worked. I could browse the iMac's filesystem from my Windows
machine and all was good (I'd been able to do this the other way around
for ages and with no problems whatsoever).</p>

<p>Then I got curious.</p>
<p>What would happen if, once I had this set up, I "unsplit" the password and
went back to using the iCloud password to log in? That's when it got really fun.</p>
<p>To do this it asks you for the current password and also your iCloud password.
I entered both and...</p>

<p>Yup. It refuses, every single time, to accept that the iCloud password I'm
entering is valid. Trust me, it is. I'm entering the correct password. I can
log in to the iCloud website with it just fine. But when I use it to try and
"unsplit" my password.... nope.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>I've even tried disabling SMB sharing for my account, and even turning off
SMB sharing altogether. This doesn't seem to make any difference. Right now,
as far as I can see, now that I've split the password I can't go back
despite the fact that there's a method of doing it made available.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p></div>
