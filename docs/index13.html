  <div>
      <div><p>It's now
<a href="/2016/09/02/virgin_east_coast_13.html">about 3 weeks since my last post about my exploits in getting a problem solved with Virgin East Coast</a>
so now's a good time for a little update.</p>
<p>Two things were "outstanding" the last time I wrote about this. One was that
Mike (the customer relations manager in
<a href="https://twitter.com/davidhorne">the Virgin East Coast MD</a>'s office) wanted
us to meet up for a coffee and a chat about my issues and how things were
progressing, etc. Sadly I wasn't able to make the original date we'd picked
out as a possible so another date was arranged. At least, it was kind of
arranged. It was noted that this week might be a good time to meet and I'd
written back to him to say that Wednesday 21st would be good. Since then
I've had no reply at all.</p>
<p>The second thing that is outstanding is having someone call me about the
issues with the Ticket Wallet app. I've yet to receive a call from the
person who originally phoned me and who I missed (and who I chased up every
day for a week afterwards). I was then told by Mike, about 2 weeks or so
back, that that person's manager would call me instead and that I should
expect a call early last week.</p>
<p>That call didn't happen. Didn't happen early last week, late last week, at
all last week. It's now Thursday this week and I've still not had a call.</p>
<p>Just this morning I've chased up both of the above.</p>
<p>It's
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">now over 3 months since I first reported the Ticket Wallet app problem</a>
and I seem to be no closer to seeing it resolved, or even having an
explanation as to the cause of the problem.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's
<a href="/2016/08/10/virgin_east_coast_12.html">just over 3 weeks now since I wrote about how I was finally getting somewhere with my problems with Virgin East Coast</a>,
so now seems like a good time to update on what's happening. Here's the
things that the PR manager in the MD's office said he'd be sorting, along
with what happened afterwards:</p>
<p><strong>Virgin would BACS me the value of the cheque they kept failing to send</strong></p>
<p>This happened and happened quickly too. The money turned up in my account
(actually rounded up a little) without any fuss or bother.</p>
<p>That said... I did receive a cheque from them anyway that is written to a
value that has no relation to the refund I was entitled to and isn't even
similar to the rounded-up value that I received via BACS. I've not done
anything with the cheque yet; there was no accompanying letter to say what
it was for, nothing to explain why it differed by around £10 (more) from
what I was expecting and what turned up in my account, nothing to explain
why I was getting it at all.</p>
<p>I emailed Mike (the customer relations manager) last Friday and got a reply
last Saturday so say he'd look into it when he got back to his desk this
last Tuesday (Monday being a Bank Holiday in England and Wales). I'm writing
this on Friday morning and haven't had that update yet (so I have sent off
an email to chase this up).</p>
<p>In the mean time I'm doing nothing with the cheque. It seems unfair to cash
it if it was a simple error on their part.</p>
<p><strong>Someone with knowledge of the Ticket Wallet App would phone me direct</strong></p>
<p>This happened. Sort of. The day after things started to get resolved I
received a call. Sadly I was driving at the time and was in no position to
take it. When I finally got home and tried calling back there was no answer.
Since then I've tried calling the number every day for the first week and a
couple of times in the second week; I've had no answer at all. Neither have
I received a call from the person who originally tried calling.</p>
<p>I let Mike know about this in an email about a week back and he said he'd
chase it up. So far I've had no word on the subject since (again, I've sent
off an email chasing this up this morning).</p>
<p><strong>They'd send me 4 First Class return tickets by way of an apology</strong></p>
<p>This happened and happened quickly. I've no complaints on this score. Also,
Mike has been very kind in allowing me to email him direct to arrange seat
reservations each time I've needed to use a ticket (once so far, second
request went off this morning for the use of the second of the tickets).</p>
<p><strong>The CR manager would keep in contact to update me on how things are being
improved</strong></p>
<p>This one not quite so much, but I didn't see this as quite so important and
it wasn't something I was looking for. What mattered to me was that the
refund I was owed got to me and that the apparent problem with the Ticket
Wallet app got fixed.</p>
<p>That said... back in the early 1990s a lot of software that I developed was
designed for complaints handling departments (used in some pretty well-known
companies too). It was all about keeping customers happy, keeping in contact
with them, keeping track of how well you're doing, keeping track of promised
contact dates and ensuring they were met (that whole thing of a call to say
you've failed is better than no call so you appear to have failed twice),
that sort of thing. I guess, from this point of view, I do have an interest
in how Virgin East Coast handle their customer relations and what systems
they have in place so they appear to be competent.</p>
<p>As for getting to chat: Mike did name a couple of dates when he'd be close
to where I tend to be working and suggested we get together for a coffee and
a chat about this subject. Given we've both got fluid diaries (his far more
than mine, I'm sure) it's all a little up in the air but I think there's a
possible date in the next week.</p>
<p>So that's where I'm at: one problem solved (with an offshoot curiosity that
I'm trying to get to the bottom of) and one outstanding.</p>
<p>Not perfect. Not terrible either.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Just one day on from
<a href="/2016/08/09/virgin_east_coast_11.html">yesterday's update post</a> where I
wrote about how pretty much every promise made by Virgin East Coast had
(once again) been broken and it looks like it's all change (or at least
looks a lot more promising now).</p>
<p>After I wrote the post I did the usual thing of
<a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/762926618188931073">tweeting it</a> and
I then went about the business of sending off yet another set of chase-up
emails.</p>
<p>The first to come back was from the person dealing with the compensation
cheque. I'd pointed out that it was now a week since the sending of the
cheque via recorded delivery was supposed to have happened and that nothing
had turned up. This was the reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry to hear this still has not happened. Would it be possible for
you to send me your address so that I can track the cheque and I will find
out as soon as possible where this is. I apologise for the delay, but rest
assured my number one goal is to get this issue resolved for you. I look
forward to hearing from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually annoyed me a little. I'd asked when the cheque had been sent
and also how it'd been sent so that I could see if the original promise had
been kept. The answer appeared to be avoiding that question. On
subsequent replies I was told that it had been issued the week earlier but
hadn't been dealt with in person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I followed it up with our fulfilment department and they told me that they
had it in the office with them. It is the one that was originally sent out
on the 2nd August and for some reason had not been issued by that
department. Our fulfilment is outsourced and so when we raise letters or
cheques we phone them to check on the progress. I am sorry that they did
not issue it but rest assured it has been sent now as I made it a case of
urgency due to the delays you have already experienced. I can only
apologise for the further delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given all the previous conversations where I was told about how they were
moving some systems that dealt with this -- which were previously outsourced
-- in-house (although apparently not the part that involves
actually sending cheques) I'm even more strongly suspecting that the first
couple of attempts to send the cheque never actually happened.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short(ish): after a bit of back and forth to get to the
bottom of what was actually going on I was assured that the cheque had
finally been sent. Frustratingly this wasn't quite what I wanted. I'm
unlikely to be around to receive an item of post sent via recorded delivery
so I'd have liked it to be sent elsewhere (it should be no surprise that
people who use Virgin East Coast's services a fair bit are also quite likely
to be away from their normal address quite a bit during "normal" hours).</p>
<p>That said... some progress there. While it'd taken <em>far</em> too long to get it
resolved, it was finally starting to appear like it was being resolved.</p>
<p>This approach was, however, being rendered moot by other events.</p>
<p>Backing up again to yesterday: after I'd tweeted about the blog post, and
mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> so they
could have a chance to see and respond (they didn't this time), my adorable
girlfriend did a bit of checking in the background and did a little retweet:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For goodness sake, sort this out <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">@DavidHorne</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AliWatson23">@AliWatson23</a> <a href="https://t.co/JibgmfZwjD">https://t.co/JibgmfZwjD</a> - 8 weeks, 11 blogs, no progress! <a href="https://t.co/iUTCApBnC7">https://t.co/iUTCApBnC7</a></p>&mdash; Jo (@0rangelic) <a href="https://twitter.com/0rangelic/status/762933732982591488">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>I was sceptical that this would have any effect. I'd been promised a call or
something from the "MD's Office" by the customer support people over a week
ago and nothing had happened. Even when I'd sent them a follow-up DM near
the end of the week I got no reply at all. I'd got to the point where I'd
assumed I was just being fobbed off.</p>
<p>I was
<a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne/status/762948887355256832">wrong to think so though</a>.
While the request to email the details of the issue was slightly frustrating
(you'd think 11 blog posts would document the issues in enough detail, and a
link <em>was</em> provided) it was heartening to see <em>something</em> happening.</p>
<p>I did point this out to David:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">@DavidHorne</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/0rangelic">@0rangelic</a> You&#39;ll find all the details on the linked blog post (and previous 10). Plus in <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> systems (hopefully).</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/762949242126295040">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>and also point out that if the details weren't in their system, that might
be a brilliant illustration of the cause of the issues:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">@DavidHorne</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/0rangelic">@0rangelic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> If not, there&#39;s the real problem. ;-)</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/762949341417967616">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>I didn't hear much more until around 18:30 when, all credit to him, David
did check that I'd had someone contact me:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidHorne">@DavidHorne</a> Not from your office, as far as I&#39;m aware of (which was promised for last week but never happened), if that&#39;s what you mean.</p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/763065373306609664">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>At that point he asked me for some contact details (again, a slightly
frustrating indication of an organisation that doesn't have joined-up
systems) which I provided (my main email address and my mobile number).</p>
<p>I didn't hear anything more that evening but, earlier today, I had an email
from a Mike Ross ("Customer Relations Manager - MD's Office" according to
the bottom of the email). He said he'd like to have a chat and could I let
him know when would be a good time to call. I replied saying any time during
normal business hours would be good for me.</p>
<p>That call made all the difference. As well as obviously offering an apology
for all that had happened so far, Mike was kind enough to both explain what
was likely happening and why (they inherited a setup that involved a lot of
outsourced contracts for lots of parts of the business -- something they're
fixing by bringing many systems back in-house) while also actually listening
to what I was saying.</p>
<p>More to the point though, he made very clear promises on how he was going to
get my issues solved. Here's the outcome of that conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any and all cheques raised to try and get the refund to me will be stopped
  and the payment sent to me via BACS (something they're not set up for
  doing in general but which they're working on fixing).</li>
<li>Someone with good knowledge of their Ticket Wallet App and their website
  will give me a call in the next day or so to go over the issues and try
  and get things working (or at least ensure there's a good understanding of
  the cause of the problem).</li>
<li>By way of saying thanks they're going to send me four first class open
  return tickets for use on the East Coast line. I think that's a very kind
  and generous gesture and one that's going to be very useful to me over the
  next couple of months. (the tickets come with the offer of being able to
  email Mike's office and have them sort the booking of an actual seat for
  each journey).</li>
<li>Mike has also said he wants to stay in touch and keep me informed of how
  things are changing in Virgin East Coast so that the issues I've
  experienced have less chance of happening in the future.</li>
<li>Related to the above he's also said he'd like to meet up for coffee once
  or twice to go over things and have a chat about how the company appear to
  a paying customer. While I'd never hold myself up as a typical customer,
  and especially not one who has any particular insight, I think it's an
  impressive approach to take.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am, of course, feeling cautious about all of the above. It is "just"
another set of promises that could be easily broken and, so far, VEC don't
have a brilliant track record of doing that. But the promises appeared
genuine and to think otherwise would be to not allow them to fix the issues.</p>
<p>I'll write more about it on the blog as things happen.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's now another Tuesday morning. It's the Tuesday morning
<a href="/2016/08/02/virgin_east_coast_10.html">after the previous Tuesday morning</a>
when I was waiting on some sort of call from Virgin regarding the missing
refund. After I wrote that last post I dropped the chap I'd spoken to an
email to chase up what was happening. This was his reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry that I was not able to contact you yesterday as this system
switchover is happening we are going through an extremely busy period in
the business. I have looked into your case and have reissued the cheque
that you did not receive and that should be with you shortly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under normal circumstances I'd imagine a cheque sent in the post would
arrive within a couple of working days. Given that was last Tuesday I think
it's fair to say that it should have turned up by last Friday.</p>
<p>Thing is, when I'd spoken to that chap the week before he'd assured me that
they'd send this cheque by recorded delivery to ensure that it got through.</p>
<p>I still don't have the cheque.</p>
<p>I guess this means one of 3 things has happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>He said he'd sent it, but he hadn't.</li>
<li>He did send it, but not via recorded delivery, and it's disappeared into
  whatever black hole snail mail from Virgin East Coast seems to be
  disappearing into.</li>
<li>He did send it, via recorded delivery, and we now have some clue as to
  where the above black hole is located.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the cause, I'm going to have to drop him a line again and find out
what's happening.</p>
<p>On <a href="/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html">a previous post about this issue</a>
my friend Mark raised an interesting issue: if Virgin had lost access to the
required data because they'd ceased using the services of some third party
(as was claimed), what did this mean in data protection terms? I'd not
really considered this but it was a fair question. When I last emailed
Virgin I asked about this too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aside, could I also ask who's a good person to speak to about what
was happening with my data during the period Virgin East Coast didn't have
access to it? Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question got this reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data is still with us as a company it is just in the process of being
uploaded onto our systems. The information has never left our company it
is just in the process of being updated onto our systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For now, at least, I'm happy enough with that as an explanation. I'm going
to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's Razor</a> to
this and assume it was just clumsy wording when the subject first came up.</p>
<p>So, to summarise this situation so far: a late journey that happened back on
June 2nd, for which compensation was confirmed in email on June 6th, the
cheque for which was supposed to turn up early July at the latest, still
hasn't appeared by August 8th. Worse still, I've been told 3 times now that
"the cheque is in the post" and on at least one of those occasions it
appears to have been an outright fib due to the closing of some of their
systems.</p>
<p>On top of the above, there's another contact I'm awaiting that has yet to
happen. Last week, when I tweeted about the previous post, the Virgin East
Coast twitter people asked me to provide them with my contact details.</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg">@davepdotorg</a> Dave, can you DM us your contact details? ^AD</p>&mdash; Virgin Trains EC (@Virgin_TrainsEC) <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC/status/759043408253943808">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>I checked with them why they needed the details (given that they're
obviously already on the system) and they said that they'd escalated it to
the "Managing Director's office" and that they wanted my contact details so
that office could contact me. I provided them and also pointed out that email is
normally the best way to contact me -- they then asked for the best email
address to contact me on and I provided that too.</p>
<p>Having done that I was told they'd be in touch "next week". In this case
"next week" was any time last week (as of the time of writing and
publishing).</p>
<p>Nobody got in contact last week. Nobody from a "Managing Director's Office",
nobody at all from Virgin East Coast.</p>
<p>So, as of right now, I'm waiting on the following from Virgin East Coast,
all promised by them:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reply as to what's happening with the inability to log in with the
  Ticket Wallet application (outstanding since 2016-07-15, although really
  outstanding from a while before then).</li>
<li>A cheque that was supposed to have been sent via recorded delivery on
  2016-08-02.</li>
<li>Some form of contact from the "Managing Director's office" that was
  promised on 2016-07-29 and which was supposed to have happened some time
  between 2016-08-01 and 2016-08-05. This contact to, in part, deal with the
  two contact failures above.</li>
</ul>
<p>The unwillingness or inability to stay in contact with a customer who has
problems does seem to be a persistent pattern. One that seems to go to the
top.</p>
<p>Right, time to publish this and start sending out even more chase-up emails.
I guess it gives me something to keep me busy when I'm on the train.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's Tuesday morning. That means it's the day after
<a href="/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html">Virgin said they'd call me back to deal with the refund issue from last Friday</a>.
I've not had a call back. That's the second time now I've been told they'll
call me back on a specific date and I've had nothing.</p>
<p>Right now I'm missing a callback about the refund <em>and</em> some sort of update
on the ticket wallet issue (which was promised "very soon"
<a href="/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html">back on July 15th</a>).</p>
<p>I'm also waiting for some sort of contact from another party in the
organisation that I was promised via DM on twitter last Friday. No sign of
that either (although no timescale was given for that).</p>
<p>It's starting to get a little tedious, always having to be the one to chase
things up.</p>
<p>But chase them up I will...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Given it's been a couple of weeks, I thought I'd write a little update on
the fun and games with Virgin East Coast. I'll also add another little
"problem" into the mix in this post -- something that has been happening in
the background and didn't seem to be an issue to start with.</p>
<p>As <a href="/2016/07/14/virgin_east_coast_8.html">mentioned a couple of weeks back</a>,
I dropped them a line to chase things up (pointing out that the scheduled
callback was long overdue) and got this reply on the 15th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your email reply and apologies that I did not call you on
the 11th I must have missed my Outlook reminder.</p>
<p>I have today again tried to call our second line support team to query
this again and see how far they are with this however they have not picked
up so I have emailed them once again.</p>
<p>Last time I spoke to them on the phone the person said that it should only
be a few more days so hopefully I will be emailing you again very soon
with some more substantial information on this for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I write this it's the 29th and I've had no update. I guess this is the
problem with phrases like "very soon" -- you're never quite sure if you
should read it to mean in the next couple of days, or if 14 days later still
falls within "very soon". Personally, if it was me, I'd be dropping a line
along the way to say "it's taking longer than I'd like, but I'm still on
it". You know, that thing of ensuring the customer doesn't feel like they've
been forgotten about.</p>
<p>So, very soon<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, I guess I'll be sending another follow-up email to try and
find out what's going on. I'll update when I do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile.... there's another issue that's brewing.</p>
<p>Back at the start of June I was on a train that was delayed by more than
half an hour. This is the first time this has happened to me since I've been
using the trains a lot and I was delighted to find that they make a point of
letting you know that
<a href="https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/customer-service/delay-repay/">you're entitled to a refund on your ticket, depending on how late you are</a>.</p>
<p>That struck me as very sensible and very civilised.</p>
<p>So, when I finally got home, I put in my claim and on June 6th I got an
email confirming I was entitled to a 50% refund and that it would be sent as
a cheque to me within 28 days.</p>
<p>Of course, 28 days later, nothing had turned up. I called them shortly after
that to find out what was going on. They claimed the cheque had been sent
and suggested it had got lost on the way (in the 2 years I've been at this
address it's the first time I've knowingly had mail disappear). Anyway, they
cancelled that cheque and issued another, apologising for the hassle and
promising that the new one would be with me within a week.</p>
<p>As it was I wasn't around for a couple of weeks after that so I got home
yesterday, expecting to see the cheque on my doormat. I expected
incorrectly.</p>
<p>I've called them about it again today and was told the most interesting
story: apparently they can't help me right now because they've closed down a
call centre down in Plymouth (I think it was), which was "outsourced", and
they now no longer have access to the "computer system" with all the cases
in it. They assured me that they'd get access to it within the next week or
two.</p>
<p>Let that settle in for a moment: they apparently arranged to close down a
call centre without ensuring that the computer systems that contain (some
of?) their customers' data were handed over in some way, shape or form.</p>
<p>That's a touch worrying.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, I wasn't terribly pleased by this news. I'm a couple
of months on from when the delay happened and I <em>still</em> don't have the
cheque. On top of that, not having received the second attempt at sending
it, I find out that nothing was likely being done about it because they'd
(apparently) dropped the staff/company who would have been dealing with it.
And I had to phone them (again) to find out.</p>
<p>I imagine that if I'd just left it to them to get in contact and let me
know, I'd have waited and waited and never got anything at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, after pointing out that it was a bit much to ask
me to let them hold onto my money even longer, just because of their system
and business issues, I was passed to someone else who was able to suggest a
far better and far quicker method of resolving this.</p>
<p>So: I'm expecting a call back from them on Monday to get that process under
way. I wonder if <em>this</em> callback will happen?</p>

      <div><p>Little update on the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app saga. After
<a href="/2016/07/06/virgin_east_coast_6.html">my previous reply to them</a> I got a
reply back yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr Pearson</p>
<p>Many thanks for your email dated 6th July 2016 regarding the fact that you
cannot sign into your Virgin Trains ticket wallet app after registering on
the desktop version of our website with the email address
davep.org+virgin@gmail.com.</p>
<p>I firstly apologise for the lack of understanding on the part of our
Virgin Trains East Coast Web Support team with regards to this, the Mobile
ticket issue on our app that you have described is one that has not
occurred very frequently at all for any of our customers and as such this
is what is causing the difficulty in resolving this for you.</p>
<p>I have today spoken to our second line support team and asked them the
question of if there is soon to be a fix for this for you to which they
have stated that they need a few more days to get this fixed.</p>
<p>I will schedule in a contact back for you for Monday 11th July and after
chasing them about this again I will contact you to let you know what is
happening with this now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it's taken quite a while, it looks like I'm finally making some
progress. If I'm reading it right they finally acknowledge that there is a
problem and that it needs fixing. It's frustrating that I've had to go
backwards and forwards a few times to get to this point.</p>
<p>Monday will be interesting.</p></div>

      <div><p>It's been over a week now
<a href="/2016/06/28/virgin_east_coast_5.html">since I last had contact with customer services</a>
and there's still been no word. So, earlier today, I sent off an email.
Short and sweet, requesting that I possibly get an answer to the questions
I'd asked them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, it's over a week now since I answered the couple of questions you
asked and asked a couple of my own. Is it possible to get a reply and an
update on what's happening?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in the day I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Dave</p>
<p>Thank you for your email dated 6th June 2016 concerning the tickets that
you have not booked with us yet and the fact that your Mobile App ticket
wallet is not able to show you anything after you have installed it.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that there has been a mix up with the confirming to you
if your email address has been registered or not and a such I wish to
clarify this for you, also that there has been such a delay in responding
to you.</p>
<p>I can now confirm that your email address davep.org+virgin@gmail.com is
registered on our website and that you have signed up for our Ticket
wallet app successfully. We apologise for telling you that it was not but
this could well have been that we were searching your email address that
you have been emailing us from and this is what has caused the confusion.</p>
<p>With regards to the use of our Ticket Wallet app before you have made a
booking with us either on that or on our desktop site, it is believed that
you will not be able to see much at all within the app before you make a
booking with us however we have made the raise about this for you and we
chased this up on the 27th June when you emailed us previously.</p>
<p>I will chase this up again however if possible please confirm what page
you get to in the ticket wallet app at the moment so that we can identify
if this is normal for a customer has no booking allocated to the app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I'm starting to seriously consider the idea that I'm being
trolled. To start with, there's this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>concerning the tickets that you have not booked with us yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard not to read that as sarcasm. Any way I look at it it comes across
as sarcasm. Sure, of course I've not booked any tickets direct with them
(although I have booked lots of tickets with them this year via other
websites) because of the issue -- that's the damn issue!</p>
<p>Anyway, possible over-sensitivity on my part aside...</p>
<p>The reply <em>still</em> seems to think that the problem is that I'm not seeing
tickets I've not booked inside the Ticket Wallet app. That isn't the
problem. The problem, as I clearly stated from the very start, is that I
can't even log into the app. I. CAN'T. LOG. IN!</p>
<p>I've said this plenty of times. I've made it very clear that this is the
problem. And still I'm being asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>please confirm what page you get to in the ticket wallet app</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm really wondering what part of "I can't even log into the app" is so hard
to understand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at least I've now got my second confirmation of the fact
that I do actually have an account on their website, after being told I
don't. I suppose that's something.</p>
<p>Meanwhile.... the Ticket Wallet app is
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html"><em>still</em></a> telling me that my user name
or password are incorrect.</p>
<p>PS: "Thank you for your email dated 6th June 2016" -- it's July, not June.</p></div>

      <div><p>Quick update on where things are at with the attempt to get help with the
apparent inability to log into the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app using
an otherwise perfectly valid account...</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="/2016/06/27/virgin_east_coast_4.html">yesterday</a> I had an
email from them. I replied (after writing yesterday's blog post):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm very concerned and very confused by your question about if I've even
registered with the main website. Yes, I have. I've confirmed this more
than once now. During my first phone conversation with support I was told
I wasn't in the system and then, when I demonstrated that I had to be, I
was magically "found" after some magic "fix" was applied on the fly. Now
I'm being told I don't exist again.</p>
<p>I seem to be going backwards with this rather than going forwards, and
what's even more frustrating is that any question I ask seems to get
ignored while I keep being asked the same basic questions time and again.</p>
<p>Yes, I did register with the main website. That's how I found there was an
Android app that works with it. That's how I followed the link to
it. That's how I found the support report form and managed to drop you a
line in the first place.</p>
<p>So, just so I'm 100% clear on this: which email address are you looking
for? How are you looking for it? Where are you looking for it? How come
someone looked for it before, didn't find it, and then found it when
looking again? If I'm not in the system how is it possible for me to log
into the main website?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also added a couple of screenshots, with explanation, that shows me
logging in with the address they claim doesn't exist in their system.</p>
<p>I've had no reply to my questions so far. I've had no reply at all so far.</p>
<p>After posting yesterday's post I did the usual thing of tweeting it and,
obviously, mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a>
in the tweet.</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good 10 days into the <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> support saga and there’s no end in sight: <a href="https://t.co/ZfV0lR4DQL">https://t.co/ZfV0lR4DQL</a></p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/747362449876197377">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></center></p>
<p>This lead to a little exchange on twitter where I mentioned that the main
reason I was trying to switch to Virgin's own system, rather than use
someone line TheTrainLine, was so that I could get the free WiFi and save
myself a tenner each trip.</p>
<p>All credit to Virgin East Coast: they contacted me directly and have
provided me with 10 one-use WiFi access codes to keep me going while this
gets sorted out. It's not a solution to the problem, but it does remove the
extra cost I was trying to get rid of for the next 5 standard class round
trips (I sometimes sneak in a first class journey if the price is too good
to ignore).</p>
<p>So.... no still no solution, but some welcome help from them to be going on
with. Can't grumble at that.</p></div>
