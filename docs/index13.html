  <div>
      <div><p>Just under a year ago I decided to
<a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">totally rewrite my GNU emacs config</a>.
As I wrote at the time, it'd been following me around all sorts of machines
since the early 1990s, starting life on an OS/2 Warp machine and travelling
via MS-DOS, GNU/Linux, Windows and, these days, macOS.</p>
<p>The changes I made last year have served me really well, but there were two
related issues with it that bothered me a little: the fact that I was
maintaining a local library of elisp code in the repository and, worse
still, I was storing the packages I'd installed from elpa and melpa in the
repository as well.</p>
<p>While this did mean it was pretty easy for me to start up a new installation
of emacs on a machine -- all I had to do was clone the repo and run up emacs
-- I wasn't happy with the duplication involved. I didn't like holding code
in my <code>.emacs.d</code> repo that was already held in package archives.</p>
<p>The solution I saw was in two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get some of my code, that might be useful to others, into melpa.</li>
<li>Somehow sort my own package archive for my personal code.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>Over the past week or so I've worked on this approach. It initially started
with me tackling item 1 above: I tidied up and
submitted
<a href="https://github.com/davep/obfusurl.el"><code>obfusurl.el</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/protocols.el"><code>protocols.el</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/services.el"><code>services.el</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/thinks.el"><code>thinks.el</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/uptimes.el"><code>uptimes.el</code></a>. This was a really
helpful process in that it allowed me to brush up on my elisp and emacs
knowledge. It's a good 15+ years since I last wrote any significant elisp
code and things have moved on a little in that time.</p>
<p>Having done that I'd managed to move a handful of my own packages out of my
local library of code, and so out of my <code>.emacs.d</code> repo, but it left me with
the problem of what to do with the rest of it.</p>
<p>That's when I discovered <code>package-x</code> and:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">----</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">C</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">package</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">upload</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">buffer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">RET</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="err">`</span><span class="o">----</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(plus <code>package-upload-file</code> too, of course). This meant I could, in effect,
start my own personal package archive and look at tackling issue 2 above.</p>
<p>This did give me one small problem though: how and where would I host the
archive? I did consider hosting it on a DigitalOcean droplet, but that felt
a little like overkill for something so simple. And then I
realised: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>! All I needed to do was
keep the package archive in its own repo (which I would have done anyway)
and then make the whole repo the source for a GitHub Pages site. A quick
test later and... it worked!</p>
<p>So, by this point, I'd farmed some of my code off to melpa, and now had the
rest of it in "delpa" (which I'd called my personal archive). I could now
use the emacs package management system to install third party packages and
also my own.</p>
<p>But I was still left with one issue: I was still holding the installed
packages inside my <code>.emacs.d</code> repo by way of ensuring that all machines were
in sync in terms of what was installed. Now I needed to work out how to
solve that.</p>
<p>Around this time, as luck would have
it, <a href="https://github.com/tarsius">@tarsius</a>
had
<a href="https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el/pull/1#issuecomment-288462491">suggested I look at</a> a
package called <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package"><code>use-package</code></a>
by <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley">@jwiegley</a>. This was the bit I was missing.</p>
<p>With <code>use-package</code> I would be able to declare which packages I needed, how
they'd be installed and, most important of all, it could be set to handle
the fact that the package wasn't even installed. If a package is requested
and there is no local install <code>use-package</code> is smart enough to get the emacs
package system to install it.</p>
<p>So, given that, all I need to do was <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/1fa67c2895f345098057654f6acb3b57a77f1194/startup/davep-packages.el">create a startup file that would
declare the packages I use</a> and
I'd have a setup that should, once I'd cloned <code>.emacs.d</code>, self-install.</p>
<p>Except... yeah, one more issue. <code>use-package</code> isn't part of GNU emacs yet so
I'd need a method of getting it to auto-install so it could then handle
everything else. As it was that was as easy as adding this to the start of
my <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el"><code>init.el</code></a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</span>
<span class="c1">;; Make sure the package system is up and running early on.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">require</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;package-archives</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;melpa&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;package-archives</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;delpa&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;http://blog.davep.org/delpa/&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-initialize</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</span>
<span class="c1">;; Bootstrap `use-package&#39;</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">unless</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-installed-p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;use-package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-refresh-contents</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-install</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&#39;use-package</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that in place I was able to nuke all my config on a machine, clone a
fresh copy of <code>.emacs.d</code> (having now ceased tracking and storing the
installed packages in that repo), run up emacs, wait a few moments and then
find that everything was installed and ready to use.</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d"><code>.emacs.d</code></a> is now a lot smaller than
it was before and, I think, even easier to maintain. Right now I think I'm
very close to the ideal emacs config that I wanted to create when I did the
complete rewrite a year ago.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I want to like Gboard. On paper it looks really rather good. It's a keyboard
from Google, it ties in with your account, it syncs things, it has clever
searching for emoji and gifs and the like... what's not to like?</p>
<p>Problem is, I've been a user of SwiftKey since around 2011 (I think it was).
I'm very used to how SwiftKey works and it also contains a lot of handy
things. I like that it has smart completion, that it learns how I type a bit
skewed and that it takes this into account, that I can turn off the fancy
swipe typing and instead make use of handy gestures like swipe-left to
delete a word. I like some of the themes a lot.</p>
<p>Into the mix comes my iPad, which I use on occasion. The standard Apple
keyboard is horrible and, sadly, I find SwiftKey on iOS just as frustrating.
It seems to lack enough key features there (especially the word deletion
gesture, as far as I can tell) that it's also a bit annoying. My dream of a
consistent typing experience across all devices just wasn't happening --
until I found Gboard on iOS.</p>
<p>That felt almost right. And from what I could tell it worked almost exactly
the same on iOS and Android. So it felt like a good time to try and force
myself to use Gboard on my Google Pixel and Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I'm just not getting on with it. It's okay. It's not bad.
It's just... not good. I'm finding that it lacks enough useful things that
it's a frustrating experience. Little things like: when I enter Google
Search, there's no word completion in the keyboard (SwiftKey has that); the
word deletion gesture (swipe left from the backspace key) seems very
hit-and-miss; the most obvious completion for a word sometimes appears in
the middle slot but, other times, in the left slot. And so on.</p>
<p>Nothing huge. Nothing that's a show-stopper. But a handful of a little
things that make me miss the comfortable home that is SwiftKey.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it does have some very handy and cleaver features too.
The searching for emoji -- including showing them up as word completions --
is rather clever. The gif-search thing is all kinds of fun too (mostly used
to annoy the hell out
of <a href="https://twitter.com/VolcanicArts">my son on twitter</a>).</p>
<p>None of those quite make up for the bits I miss from SwiftKey though.</p>
<p>All that said, I've being making a point of pushing on with Gboard, thinking
that most of my issues might just be because I'm too used to my "old home".
Mostly this was working well, until I noticed something this morning. While
reading the description for Gboard I noticed this handy thing in the "Pro
Tips" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sync your learned words across devices to improve suggestions (enable in
Gboard Settings→ Dictionary → Sync learned words).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful! I'd assumed that this was the case anyway -- it's Google after all
-- but it's good to know I can ensure it's turned on. So I went to turn it
on. This is what I found:</p>
<p><img alt="Gboard WTF" src="/attachments/2017/03/13/Screenshot_20170313-072359.png"></p>
<p>What the hell Google? Sure, I do have a Gsuite account on my phone -- as in
various apps have access to a Gsuite account (Gmail, Drive, etc...) -- but
it's not the primary account on my phone and it's not the account I'd really
want to be doing the dictionary sync with anyway. If I've got dictionary
sync I want it tied to the keyboard no matter the app I'm in, and no matter
the account I'm using in that app. I want the keyboard to be tied to a
specific account when it comes to sync (just like SwiftKey does it).</p>
<p>This, I think, is a show-stopper for me.</p>
<p>I can overlook the other niggles, I can learn to cope with it not being
quite so perfect in some situations; but the blanket inability to do
something as simple as cloud-sync the predictions and learn from how I type
-- things that are, these days, central to what Google's about -- it's
frankly stupid.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going to have to keep Gboard as a backup keyboard for those
times when I need to find the perfect gif.</p>

      <div><p>Over the past couple or so weeks I've been having some issues with Google
Now. It first seemed to start on my Nexus 7, then appeared on my Nexus 6.
More recently, even as of today, I've seen it on
my <a href="/2017/03/08/hello_google_pixel.html">Google Pixel</a>. The problem is that,
in the Google Now launcher (or on the Pixel, in the Pixel launcher), the
Google Now page (that you swipe to the left for) sits empty for ages. All I
see is the little animated waiting circle and nothing else. Once or twice
I've had the Google app die and restart or, more often than not, after quite
some time it finally loads up.</p>
<p>The latter happened a little earlier and I noticed something I'd not seen
before:</p>
<p><img alt="Blank Google Now" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-115910.jpg"></p>
<p>What's with that "Achievements" menu option? You'll notice that the whole of
the menu is blank -- no profile picture or anything and none of the menu
options seemed to work.</p>
<p>Eventually, after I'd left it for a while, it ended up working.</p>
<p><img alt="Google Now finally working" src="/attachments/2017/03/12/Screenshot_20170312-120052.jpg"></p>
<p>And, once this happened, no "Achievements" option.</p>
<p>Presumably this is some back-end server issue, I'm being served up something
I'm not supposed to be seeing and it's confusing the client app. Okay, I
don't <em>know</em> that's the case, but it has that sort of feel.</p>
<p>So now I need to go looking for what this Achievements thing is all about.</p>
<p>Using Google, obviously.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Like many programmers, I have a couple of "Hello, World" projects that I've
carried with me over the years. One is 5x5 (which has been used to get to
grips with things as diverse as the Palm Pilot and GNU emacs). Another
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides">Norton Guides database</a>
<a href="http://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">readers</a>.</p>
<p>I've made Norton Guides tools that have allowed web servers to serve guides
(<code>w3ng</code>), that have allowed you to convert guides to HTML (<code>ng2html</code>), that
have let you read guides on OS/2 and GNU/Linux (<code>eg</code>) and also have let you
read guides in Microsoft Windows (<code>weg</code>). It's a problem I know fairly well
and one where I know the solution well enough so I can concentrate on
learning the new language or environment.</p>
<p>Recently I wanted to get to grips with some
"pure" <a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ES6</a> coding while also getting
to know <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>. A new version of the Norton Guide
code, written for this environment, seemed like a good thing to do.</p>
<p>And so <a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG">jsNG</a> was born.</p>
<p>At its core is <a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG/tree/master/lib">a library of code for opening and reading data from Norton
Guides databases</a>. While I
doubt it's good ES6 code, or even good node.js code, it's been very useful
in giving me a fun problem to solve and it'll carry on being something I'll
tweak and tinker with by way of trying new things out.</p>
<p>On top of this I've built a handful of tools for working with Norton Guides
databases. The most useful one at the moment (the others are more in the
"test the library" than the "make something handy with the library"
category) is <code>ngserve</code>. This is designed as a simple Norton Guides database
HTTP server.</p>
<p><img alt="ngserve in action" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.10.18.png"></p>
<p>When run, you give it a list of guides to serve:</p>
<p><img alt="Starting ngserve" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.26.44.png"></p>
<p>and it does the right thing. It has a small number of command line options
that help configure what it does:</p>
<p><img alt="ngserve command line options" src="/attachments/2017/03/10/Screen Shot 2017-03-10 at 10.29.28.png"></p>
<p>Possibly the most useful are the ones that let you change how it handles
"higher" DOS characters and, if you don't like the default colours and
stuff, the option that lets you point to your own style sheet (note for now
you'll need to host the stylesheet somewhere else -- ngserve won't serve it
for you; I'm aiming to change that in some way in the near future).</p>
<p>jsNG does have a fairly basic design compromise at its heart. In the very
early version I started out using the async functions for opening and
reading the guides. This got very tedious very quickly and I could see that
it was going to make for a very messy library with a very messy interface.
While it might not be in the spirit of node.js programming I decided to go
with the sync version of the file IO functions and code up the core library
based around this.</p>
<p>This approach also means that I took another leap that I never have done
with Norton Guides before: rather than doing the traditional thing of
keeping an open handle into them and reading direct from the file as you
navigate the guide, I simply read it all into a buffer in one go and keep it
in memory. This is a "guides are small, memory is cheap, things will go
faster" approach.</p>
<p>It does mean that when you load up a load of guides into <code>ngserve</code> they're
all sat in memory. The upside of this is that things should be a lot faster
and the code is a lot easier to follow (I think). To put this in some
perspective: I have a directory here that contains 110 Norton Guides files.
They total 36M in size. If that seems like a lot of stuff to hold in
memory... remind me how much is being used by your web browser so you can
look at some hilarious kittens. ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, that's where I'm at with it right now. The code is mostly settled
and mostly tidy. I need to write up some documentation for it (and so I need
to take a look at good JavaScript documentation tools) and perhaps tinker
with <code>ngserve</code> a little more. I'd also like to do a new version of <code>ng2html</code>
with this -- a version that makes it <em>far</em> easier to control the style of
the output. I'm also tempted to do a CLI-based reader in pure ES6; something
similar to <code>EG</code> or <code>WEG</code>.</p>
<p>All in good time.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>For the past two years I've, mostly, being happily using a Google Nexus 6 as
my phone. In the past six months or so I've started to notice that it hasn't
been quite as good as it was. The main problem, for me, was that the camera
was starting to play out. The issues were the ones that I've seen reported
elsewhere: use of the camera would quickly make the phone laggy, very slow
response times on pressing the shutter, occasional failure to save an image,
etc. This was generally frustrating and, even more so, because <a href="/2016/11/15/seen_by_davep_(the_return).html">I'd got back
into photoblogging</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... I've been lusting over the Google Pixel ever since it was
originally shown off. I was some way off my phone contract renewal and the
price of a new Pixel was something I just couldn't justify. Last week though
an offer cropped up that meant I could renew early <em>and</em> get a Pixel
(including a free Daydream headset thrown in).</p>
<p>Fast forward to Monday just gone and...</p>
<p><img alt="My new Pixel" src="/attachments/2017/03/08/IMG_20170308_120458.jpg"></p>
<p>So far I'm liking it rather a lot. It is odd that it's smaller in my hand
than the Nexus 6 was (the XL wasn't an available option <em>and</em> I was also
starting to think it was time to drop down in size a little again) but I'm
also finding it a little easier to work with; it's also nice that it fits in
trouser pockets as well as jacket pockets.</p>
<p>It feels very fast (although every Android phone and tablet I've ever had
have felt fast to start with) and smooth to use. I especially like the
default feedback vibration -- it's a lot smoother yet also more reassuring
than any I've felt before.</p>
<p>The Google Assistant is proving to be very handy. I'm sort of used to it
anyway thanks to having owned an Android Wear watch for a couple of years
but having it on the phone like this seems like a natural next step.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm getting very used to very quickly, and really liking a
lot, is fingerprint recognition. I didn't think I needed it but now I'm
wondering how I ever managed without it. Combined with the notification
pull-down gesture that the recognition area supports it seems like a perfect
way to open the get going with a phone.</p>
<p>There's a couple of niggles with it, of course. The main one for me is the
lack of wireless charging. That was something I really liked about the Nexus
6: I could be sat at my desk and have the phone sat on top of a charging
pad, staying topped up. No such handy setup with the Pixel. The other thing
is the lack of water resistance. To be fair: it's not something I've ever
really felt I <em>needed</em> with other phones and I'm not in the habit of
sticking them under water; but knowing that it doesn't matter too much if it
gets exposed to rain would be nice.</p>
<p>Other than that... there's not much else to say right now. It works and
works well, the move from the N6 to it was pretty smooth and the Pixel has
fallen perfectly into my normal routine.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>A few years back, not long after I got my first smartphone (a HTC Magic), I
started maintaining a photoblog that was based around photos I took on that
phone. The blog itself was very important to me as it covered a pretty
difficult time in my life -- many of the images on it contained and conveyed
feelings and emotions that seem a world away now, but which I never want to
totally forget.</p>
<p>It served as a visual diary, a note to future me.</p>
<p>And, hopefully, it provided some entertainment for those who viewed it.</p>
<p>Sadly the company who hosted
it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous#Shutting_down_Posterous_and_building_PostHaven">closed down</a> and
the whole thing was lost, except for a hasty (and only partially successful)
backup to <a href="https://seenbydavep.wordpress.com/">a Wordpress blog</a>.</p>
<p>After the blog died I sort of lost interest in trying to maintain one and,
to some degree, lost interest in active photography in general. Between the
blog disappearing and another disappointing event relating to photography I
sort of lost confidence in myself and my ability to dare to publish photos
online.</p>
<p>This year, despite how shitty it's been for the world in general, has been a
really good one for me. Lots of positive changes have happened and continue
to happen and I noticed that I was starting to do the phone-based photoblog
thing
again, <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/media">albeit only via twitter</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="From up the hill" src="/attachments/2016/11/15/FromUpTheHill.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, this week, I've cracked and decided to make it "official". My old
"Seen by davep" blog is reborn, with new content and the same old purpose.
You can find it here: <a href="http://seenbydavep.blogspot.com/"><strong>seenbydavep.blogspot.com</strong></a></p>
<p>The blog itself is still driven by twitter and the posts will still appear
on twitter. In the background I have an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> process
running, watching for any tweet of mine with the #photoblog tag and creating
a post on the blog from it.</p>
<p>As for how often and what the content will be... simple: it'll be when I see
something that I need to capture.</p></div>

      <div><p>Over the past couple or so
weeks <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">my Macbook air</a> has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"></p>
<p>Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.</p>
<p>So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.</p>
<p>I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.</p>
<p>I joined the queue.</p>
<p>About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.</p>
<p>By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p>So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.</p>
<p>Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Yesterday I got the call about the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app that
I was <a href="/2016/10/29/virgin_east_coast_20.html">promised last week</a> (well,
actually, promised a couple of months back). It didn't go well.</p>
<p>Well, I say "didn't go well", the conversation itself went very well, the
chap I spoke to was polite and apologetic and helpful, but the outcome
wasn't really very brilliant.</p>
<p>It didn't get off to a brilliant start when I was first told that the
solution to my problem was that I needed to uninstall and then reinstall the
app (something I've done more than once while trying to get to the bottom of
the problem). I asked if that was really necessary and I was informed that
it was the only way to fix the problem of the tickets not showing. Problem
is... that wasn't my problem. So I then had to explain the exact nature of
the fault I was experiencing (and also explained my guess as to what the
cause of the problem was).</p>
<p>After that, much of the content of the conversation involved vaguely
confidential information (nothing too terrible or that big a secret -- just
stuff that isn't generally known yet) which I'm not going to repeat here.
The upshot of the chat though is this: they can't do anything for me.</p>
<p>Simply put: they acknowledge there's a problem with the app, the problem is
at their end, it's a problem that needs to be fixed and there's nothing they
can do to fix it any time soon.</p>
<p>The causes of this will sound familiar to anyone with experience of large
companies who outsource much of their development and get involved in areas
that they might not have much experience with.</p>
<p>I also found out the cause of <em>some</em> of the delay in actually getting back
to me: the person who was supposed to originally call me went on maternity
leave just after they'd first tried to call and, it seems, nobody thought to
pick up their workload. This left me in the bizarre position of trying to
call someone who was off work for an extended period of time, and whose
phone wasn't being answered in any way.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't explain why that person's boss, who I was promised a
call from a short while after, never bothered to call.</p>
<p>So, I think, to some degree, that's the end of this silly saga. Their
software is buggy, they can't fix it any time soon, and I'm out of luck.</p>
<p>As for the extra free tickets I was promised a couple of weeks back now...
they've still not appeared. Time for me to chase that up <em>again</em>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>The other day I stumbled on a tip about Evernote. It
was
<a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/10/28/one-student-made-productivity-habit/">a snippet of information in a bigger post on the Evernote blog</a>
so I saved it to Evernote (obviously) to take a look at later.</p>
<p>The tip was that Ctrl-Cmd-B in Evernote (on the Mac) will format a body of
text as source code. While I'm not in the habit of using Evernote to store
code, not even snippets of code (that's something far better served
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>), it seemed like something worth
committing to memory.</p>
<p>This morning, while finally in front of a suitable machine, I took a look.
Sure enough, there's the menu option.</p>
<p><img alt="Code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.36.42.png"></p>
<p>Handy! So I created a test note with some code in it so that I could see how
it formatted it. I was curious to see if it just did simple fixed text or if
it offered options to highlight various languages (I didn't hold out much
hope for the latter, but it was worth a look).</p>
<p>That's when it got odd.</p>
<p>After I created a note and went to format some code, the menu option
disappeared!</p>
<p><img alt="Lack of code formatting menu option" src="/attachments/2016/10/31/Screen Shot 2016-10-31 at 11.37.07.png"></p>
<p>From what I can tell, once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. At
least, not until you actually close down Evernote and start it up again.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, none of this is the case in the Windows version. While the
key combination is different there, the menu option is available and stays
available.</p>
<p>The version of Evernote I have (on my iMac and my Macbook) is 6.9.2. The
version number on Windows is 6.4.2 (after checking for updates -- I'm going
to guess that the Mac and Windows version numbers don't match on purpose).</p>
<p>Goodness knows what's going on here. All I can imagine is that it has
something to do
with
<a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/97731-code-block-in-evernote-for-mac/">a thread I found on Evernote's support forum</a> that
suggests that code block formatting is some sort of test/beta feature and
can only be enabled via a settings option that <em>isn't</em> available via the
version downloaded from the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>So, at some point, I guess I'm going to have to uninstall Evernote from the
Macbook and the iMac, reinstall from the Evernote website itself, and try
this again. All of which seems a bit silly when <em>the menu option is there
and visible when I run Evernote up!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> Sure enough, removing the App Store version and installing
the version from Evernote's own website, and <em>then</em> going into preferences
and enabling the option, sorted it. It's still really odd they'd promote the
facility via the blog and not mention it, and also very odd that the option
would always show until the first time you're in a position to use it, and
then it'd disappear.</p></div>

what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi again Mike.</p>
<p>It's now a week since you replied and, I think it's fair to note, it's no
longer "early" this week. I've had no call -- neither form yourself nor
from anyone related to the Ticket Wall App -- and I've not received the
promised tickets either. While I do try to be patient I have to admit that
it's starting to get very frustrating, being made lots of promises about
progress that simply never happen. This has been going on for months now
and I'm always having to chase things up.</p>
<p>I'd very much appreciate it if you could explain to me what's going on,
and why.</p>

<p>A while later I got a reply. He said he'd be getting the tickets in the post
the following day (so a Friday, which I think I can safely say isn't the
start of the week) and would also phone me.</p>
<p>The following day he did keep his promise. He called (I managed to miss him
the first time, but when I was finally free I called back and we got to
chat). He promised I'd get some more tickets early next week and also that
someone with technical knowledge would finally call about the app problem.</p>
<p>I have, of course, been here before. This is exactly the promise that was
made a couple of months ago. It's easy to make the promise, apparently not
so easy to deliver on it (or address the issue of not delivering on it).</p>
<p>So now I wait. Again. I'll be sure to update when something happens (or
doesn't).</p></div>
