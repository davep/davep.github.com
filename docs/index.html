  <div>
      <div><p>Back in 2021, I think it was, when Value first announced the Steam Deck, I
was all <em>"hell yes sign me up!"</em>; like... really, I signed up there and then
to go on the waiting list. The idea of a wee device that would let me play a
ton of games in my Steam library seemed like a great idea. The price seemed
right too.</p>
<p>So, I signed up, and waited, and waited, and life moved on.</p>
<p>When I finally (I think it was the best part of 18 months later?) got the
email saying my Deck was up for grabs and did I want to complete the
purchase I... said nah. By this point I was <em>so</em> heavily into VR gaming that
mucking with stuff on a Deck didn't seem to make much sense to me any more.</p>
<p>I moved on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks back they announced the OLED version and I took a second
look. There was now over a year of reviews to read, hacks to notice, fun to
follow; now I could get an idea if a Deck was any good and if it was for me.
So after a bit of review-reading and review-watching, Thursday last week, I
slapped down an order; and by Tuesday the Deck turned up.</p>
<p><img alt="New Deck getting going" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/new-deck.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The overturning of my original decision to <em>not</em> buy came down to a couple
of things. The first was: I recognised that there were a lot of games in my
library, sometimes things I'd bought (often in a sale), sometimes things I'd
got as part of a Humble Bundle, that just never got played. This, I noticed,
was sort of down to an unfortunate relationship I'd developed with gaming.</p>
<p>See... VR has won me over. I <em>love</em> gaming in VR. Also, I love recording my
gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson">throwing them on
YouTube</a>. This means that, to some
extent, in my head, there's <em>effort</em> to getting going with playing a game:
I've got to power up the Windows PC; I've got to let it update stuff; I've
got to let Steam update stuff; I've got to power up the VR headset; I've got
to get it to connect to the PC (which generally works fine but on occasion
needs a complete restart of everything); I need to decide what I'm playing
next and what to record; I've got to get the recording software going; I've
got to...</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Also, of course, I've got to be in the right state to be okay with having a
computer strapped to my face (sometimes you don't feel 100% and being lost
in a virtual world isn't the best thing to be doing).</p>
<p>This can feel like too much effort. It also means that gaming tends to be
left for when I've got a few hours to dedicate to it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But I also <em>love</em> playing games.</p>
<p>My thinking then was a Deck would be a great way of "forcing" myself to play
the more casual stuff. There's no easy (that I know of) way to record or
stream from the Deck; it's also easy to have it on the sofa and turn it on
in a moment. This felt like the ideal device to have to hand, that was
dedicated to gaming, and which would encourage me to take smaller gaming
sessions when the time arises.</p>
<p>Like... sometimes I'll put something on to cook, come into the living room,
pick up the tablet and scroll through the Internet. While I try not to
doom-scroll too much, I can see that it would be more healthy to pick up the
Deck and play DooM!</p>
<p>So far, two days in, I'm convinced this was an excellent idea and I'm
totally won over.</p>
<p><img alt="My Steam Deck and Stream Deck" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/IMG_3842.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I'm still getting a feel for what does and doesn't work best on the Deck,
from a <em>"my taste in games"</em> point of view, but things that allow for
dipping in and having a quick blast are winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/741510/The_Hong_Kong_Massacre/">Hong Kong Massacre</a>
has finally got a play, despite me owning it ever since I saw John Wick 4.</p>
<p><img alt="Hong Kong Massacre" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/hong-kong.jpg#centre"></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">DooM II</a> got installed
and is working well -- I may have to slowly play my way through the whole
thing. I've also installed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255070/Abyss_Odyssey/">Abyss
Odyssey</a> and so
far am finding it quite charming and fun (it's an example of a game that
isn't really my kind of thing; but I got it in a Humble Bundle, I think, and
it's been sat there with 0 hours for way too long).</p>
<p>I've also failed to resist one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/434050/Duke_Nukem_3D_20th_Anniversary_World_Tour/">more questionable titles from my
younger days</a>...</p>
<p><img alt="Come get some" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/duke.jpg#centre"></p>
<p>The real surprise for me though has been a game I bought on a whim a couple
of weeks back, which was going cheap, looked fun, seemed nice and casual and
which I installed on the PC and totally ignored (because, again, turning on
the PC to have a quick game seems like a lot of faff):
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/">Brotato</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Brotato" src="/attachments/2023/12/14/brotato.jpg"></p>
<p>This game is frantic, way over the top, kinda confusing in parts (for me)
but accessible enough that I can actually have a ton of fun with it; and
what's really important is that I can pick up the Deck, turn it on, play a
game of this for 10 minutes and then go on to do the thing I needed to do
next. It's the <em>perfect</em> game to play while waiting for the next step in
dinner to cook.</p>
<p>So, yeah, The Steam Deck... I'm won over; I'm so won over. And I haven't
even properly explored the fact that it has a full GNU/Linux desktop inside
it that I can use as a desktop machine...</p>
<div class="footnote">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Some of this is also true with gaming on the PS5; while it's easier to
turn on and get going, and while I don't have a VR setup for it, I do
have it in my head that it's more for "epic gaming" than quick casual
stuff; see <a href="https://my.chiral.pictures/">Death Stranding</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TriPR0c-eg&amp;list=PLUY2FpMDyORBQXTLCgueUh5v8DCx5TByU">Cyberpunk

  <div>
      <div><p>My journey into the Apple ecosystem has been gradual but all-consuming. I've
gone from, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">around a 8 years
ago</a>, being
unconvinced about how good the whole Apple world is, to pretty much having
all the hardware they make available, in some form, that I have an actual
use for<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the devices I was late to, but won over by, after moving away from
Android to iPhone, was the Apple Watch. These days I have two: the original
SE, and also a Series 8. Generally I've marvelled at just how seamless the
experience is. I swap watches: the connection to my phone "just works" and
it figures all that out. Stuff syncs. Stuff stays in sync.</p>
<p>I lean heavily on the watch. The Series 8 is my daily driver, and the SE
acts as my nighttime tracking device while the 8 charges and I sleep.</p>
<p>I record walks. I record runs. I record lots of heart rate data. I pay for
things, pretty much everything, with it. I... take it for granted really.</p>
<p><img alt="My main watch face" src="/attachments/2023/12/08/watch-face.png#centre"></p>
<p>Yesterday though, something odd started to happen. I noticed that some
things didn't seem to be syncing from my watch to the phone. Health-related
things weren't turning up. A recorded workout didn't show. The control of
all things audio seemed to decouple and the watch kept taking over use of my
AirPods from the phone in an annoying way I'd never experienced before.
Things like that.</p>
<p>I tried a reboot of the watch. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again. I tried a reboot of the phone. Stuff turned up.</p>
<p>It happened again.</p>
<p>I then rebooted watch and phone, stuff seemed fine, and I didn't think much
more about it.</p>
<p>Then this morning I swapped from the SE back to the Series 8 as I sat down
for breakfast, my usual routine, and the syncing was failing <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>This, for me, this is when Apple stuff gets really frustrating. There's no
easy or obvious way to diagnose what's going on. Like: I could not sync some
health data from the watch to the phone, but I <em>could</em> use "Find My" to ping
the watch (presumably a difference in communication route, BT vs Wi-Fi
perhaps). There's no obvious error dialog. There's no obvious log to look
at. There's no "your BT is borked" alert or something.</p>
<p>Searching online the advice seemed to be the nuclear option: unpair the
watch, reset it, start again. So I've done that this morning and it's been
quite the pain. Getting it set up again was straightforward enough, but
having to go through the whole thing of dismissing all the <em>"here's some
tips on how to use this watch you've had for a year and used every day"</em>
cards was annoying, also having to set up my payment cards again was
annoying. Also, and this is on me for not backing them up recently, trying
to recreate my watch faces from memory and remembering which ones they were
based on was also annoying.</p>
<p>Apple are actually so good at a lot of this seamless shit; but damn do I
wish they'd also be good at making a tool that lets you easily and smoothly
diagnose some issues. I would imagine sync issues between watch and phone
are common enough that a wee tool where you run through diagnostics, and
where there's a Q&amp;A to help narrow down the issue, would be a great
experience.</p>
<p>Anyway... it seems to be up and running again, so hopefully that's that
issue solved. I tried a couple of things that would need to sync from the
watch to the phone and they showed up instantly; actually faster than I've
been used to for quite a while.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed...</p>

      <div><p>The urge to go gadget crazy, when getting a new hobby, or reviving an old
one, is a real thing. Having recently bought <a href="/2023/10/20/a-new-guitar.html">the new
guitar</a> with a view to trying to learn to
play properly, it's something I'm very mindful of and doing my best to
avoid. However, in the middle of the week I did crack and buy one little
extra thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Fender Mustang Micro" src="/attachments/2023/11/05/IMG_3488.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>As I said in the previous blog post about the guitar: I ended up getting
something that could be played acoustic without being annoying for
neighbours, which in turn meant I didn't need any sort of amp, or pedals,
etc. This has been working out just fine. But early last week, in an idle
moment, I was looking up what might be good options for a small amp for
practising should I want to and I stumbled on the <a href="https://www.fender.com/articles/parts-and-accessories/mustang-micro">Mustang
Micro</a>.</p>
<p>Reading up on it and checking out some reviews, it sounded <em>perfect</em> for my
setup. I enjoy living in a small space, so could do without a proper amp
kicking about, so something that just plugs right into the guitar sounded
ideal.</p>
<p>I added it to a list of things to keep in mind and then... a couple of days
later I was working from home which meant I'd be about to receive a delivery
if I was to place an order and... oops!</p>
<p>I've been using it every day since it turned up and I'm so damn impressed!
This thing might be small, but it's pretty mighty! For a complete notice
like me, to muck about, and fiddle and get some great sounds out of it, I
couldn't have asked for anything more.</p>
<p><img alt="The Options" src="/attachments/2023/11/05/IMG_3489.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>The range of amp styles is way more than I could possibly do justice right
now, but what's important for me is it's got versions that are nice and
clean, and versions that are dirty and distorted. The effects are pretty
much spot on too; there's everything I could ever possibly want there.</p>
<p>My only real complaint about it is that the UI itself -- small lights that
use colour to indicate their setting -- is terrible. I don't know how else
they <em>could</em> have done it, but I know this is bad. I am at least grateful
that it's standalone and doesn't require some app on a phone to control or
something like that.</p>
<p>I know it's going to take a while for me to get the most out of this, but
already it's giving me a bit more confidence to experiment and doodle away
in idle moments. Also, the USB connection means it can be plugged into my
Mac, presumably allowing me to record with GarageBand or similar software.
While I wouldn't use it to subject anyone to my terrible playing, that will
be something for me to explore in terms of keeping a record of my progress.</p></div>

      <div><p>This follows on from my <a href="/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html">previous post</a>.
If you've not read that, it's worth having a dive in first for the
background.</p>
<p>The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair
of scripts. The first one, called <code>selection</code>, did what <code>visual-selection</code>
does, only <code>visual-selection</code> does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a
random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target
phrase.</p>
<p>As covered before: I don't remember all of the details of the conversation
that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the
lines of <em>"yes, but you start out and end up with something the same
length"</em> and <em>"nothing more complex is made"</em> (let's gloss over the whole
"complex" thing for now... well okay let's just gloss over it, end of story;
this is just a fun coding exercise).</p>
<p>What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about
I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the
"fitness landscape" that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a
population over and over and see what happens. Would I "randomly" create
known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters?</p>
<p>So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would
randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a
random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that
aren't in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival
within the landscape).</p>
<p>Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun
to write some code.</p>
<p>This version became <code>selection2</code>.</p>
<p>So, having turned <code>selection</code> into a TUI application with Textual, I <em>had</em>
to do the same with this code...</p>
<p><img alt="Evolve Words" src="/attachments/2023/10/31/evolve-words.png#centre"></p>
<p>As before, because it's fun to do so, this leans heavily on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a> and
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/evolve-words">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/evolve-words/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the last few weeks I've had a couple of sessions of working on a
library to wrap <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plotext/">Plotext</a> -- a popular
terminal-based plotting library for Python -- so that it can easily be used
in Textual apps;
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>
is the result.</p>
<p>I feel it's come together pretty well</p>
<p>But... I've been itching to find a reason to use it in a project of my own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Back in the mid-2000s, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB</a>
systems were still the fashion, I used to hang out on a site that was
chiefly aimed at the atheist and secular humanist crowd. We'd get a good
number of drive-by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism">YEC</a> types who'd
want to argue (sorry... debate) and often talk nonsense about biology and
the like.</p>
<p>Now, I'm no biologist, I'm no scientist, I'm just a hacker who likes to
write code for fun and profit; so any time there was a chance to write some
code to help illustrate an idea I'd jump at the chance. I forget the detail
now -- this was back in 2008; 15 years ago as of the time of writing -- but
one time I remember a conversation was taking place where someone was just
flat out claiming that "random mutation" can only cause "loss of
information" and could never lead to a "desired result", or some such thing.</p>
<p>If you've ever had, read or watched those debates, you'll know the sort of
thing I mean.</p>
<p>So that got me thinking back then, could I write something that could give a
simple illustration of how this doesn't quite make sense?</p>
<p>So I had a little hacking session and came up with some Ruby code<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> that
did what I felt was the job. You'd give it a phrase you wanted it to
generate (a stand-in for the current "fitness landscape", in effect), it
would then generate a totally random string of that length, and then would
set about mutating it, finding mutations that were "fitter" than others (a
stand in for selection), breed the best two so far (randomly copy one chunk
from another to create a child), then repeat over and over.</p>
<p>When I first wrote it I wasn't sure what to expect; would it ever finish
given a reasonably large target string?</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>It was fun to code.</p>
<p>It got posted to the BB and of course wasn't in any way persuasive to them
(honestly I never expected it would be). I seem to recall it being
hand-waved away with calls of there obviously being an intelligent designer
involved<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the "meanwhile..." in this: a few times this year I've thought it
could be fun to rework this in Python (it's really not that complex after
all; just a string-chopping loop really) and use Textual to put a fun UI on
it.</p>
<p>So, that's what I did, complete with <code>textual-plotext</code> plot:</p>
<p><img alt="Visual Selection in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/26/visual-selection.png"></p>
<p>While, 15 years on, this isn't going to convince anyone of the underlying
point, I think it does serve a good educational purpose. It shows that you
can create a fun UI for the terminal, with Textual, with not a lot of code.
It also shows off how you can easily create dynamic plots. Plus -- and I
think this might be the really important one -- it shows you can write
"traditional" tight-loop code in a Textual application and <em>still</em> have a
responsive UI; all thanks to the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a>.</p>
<p>The heart of the code for this application is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">environment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;This is the target string we want to create!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_fit_found</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shit_happens</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sure, there's some detail in the <code>Environment</code> class, but you get the idea:
while we've not hit the target, let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg">life find a
way</a>. A loop like that would
totally bog down an application with a UI without some other work taking
place. With Textual and workers the resulting method in the application,
complete with code to send updates to the UI, really doesn't look much
different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@work</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thread</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exclusive</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I honestly think the worker API is one of the coolest things added to
Textual and I so often see people have real <em>"woah!"</em> moments when they get
to grips with it.</p>
<p>Anyway... I've covered science, religion, and how Ruby is better than
Python, so I'm sure I've annoyed almost everyone. Job done I guess. ;-)</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/visual-selection">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/visual-selection/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p>
<p>Expect it to be my tinker project of choice for a wee while; there's a
couple of other things I'd like to add to it.</p>

      <div><p>This seems to have started with iOS 17, and I can't narrow down the how and
the when of it happening, but over the last week or so I've found that every
couple of days Siri seems to lose their voice. By this I mean the high
quality voice that's used when they speak seems to disappear. I notice this
when I ask my phone or headphones a question or to do something, and I get a
really low-quality voice that speaks back to me.</p>
<p>The voice itself seems to be a version of the voice I normally use, but like
it's using an on-device much-cut-down version. If I go into the settings to
check what voice is selected, it's the one I normally use, but it wants to
download it again.</p>
<p><img alt="Downloading the voice all over again" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/siri-voice-loss.png"></p>
<p>Sure enough, once the download is complete all is good again. I've not kept
track of when it happens -- and I think I should from now on -- but it feels
like it happens every couple of days; I almost always notice it first thing
in the morning, the first time I ask the phone or the headphones something.</p>
<p>I hope it is some sort of iOS 17 weirdness and is gone when 17.1 turns up.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This one has been brewing for a year, more or less. Now that I commute into
and back from Edinburgh most days of the working week, I find myself walking
past a couple of music shops. Seeing these reminds me of the days, back in
my 20s, when I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davepearson/albums/72157600225099352">mucked around in a couple of
bands</a>
and had fun making noises on a bass guitar. Since that time I've also owned
a cheap six string electric, which is currently in storage (and has been
since 2016) and an acoustic, which I have with me but I live in an apartment
building and I'm not an arsehole so I never play it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, walking past those shops has made me want to muck about on a
guitar again. I've never properly learnt the guitar, I've just managed to
learn enough chords to make some noises I like for my own amusement, but
even then I've not picked one up since around 2016 and what little I do know
is very rusty.</p>
<p>Add to the above: earlier this year I was at a friend's and admiring her
collection of bass and six string guitars and picked a couple up and
realised I could not play anything. It had been too long, I'd lost most
muscle memory and coordination, and what little knowledge I had.</p>
<p>So this made me want to fix this even more.</p>
<p>Given the apartment thing I decided on a plan: how about I get an eclectic,
and then some sort of amplification that would always rely on headphones?
Given such a setup I could knuckle down and try and learn properly.</p>
<p>So, this week, being on holiday, I told myself I'd pop into Edinburgh one
day and have a look at my options; perhaps even come home with something.
Yesterday was that day.</p>
<p>It didn't quite go to plan, but the outcome was that I ended up with
something to play.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Höfner" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3329.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>So, on getting into the shop, and explaining what I was after and why to the
chap in there, I tried the usual Stratocaster and Telecaster thing. Both
were fine (I think I liked the feel of the Telecaster more in my hand). I
had one eye on a Les Paul too, but never tried that. What I did see though
was this rather lovely black Höfner.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it's hollow body, so sort of has that acoustic thing going
on. This isn't what I wanted for playing in an apartment. But I had to try
it anyway. As soon as I started dabbling I was sold. The sound was enough
that it would be easy to pick up and play without having to faff with
amplification of any sort, on the other hand it was nowhere near as loud as
my acoustic. I felt like it bridged the gap between easy to pick up, and
versatile enough should I ever want to plug it into something.</p>
<p>And... let's be honest: it was black. Sooooo black. I like black.</p>
<p>Long story short... it had to come home with me!</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: most of my guitar stuff is still in storage, from when
I moved to Scotland, but I <em>did</em> find my old tin of plectrums and the tuner.</p>
<p><img alt="Standard guitar kit" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3330.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p><center>
    <em>(Yes, the tin was once mine and was once full; the early 90s were a
    different time)</em>
</center></p>
<p>I even found one of my old stands, that I've had since around 1991! So now
it's set up in my living room, next to the PCVR rig, ready to go at a
moment's notice.</p>
<p><img alt="On its stand, ready to go" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3331.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>This is my plan now: each weekend I aim to put in at least an hour a day of
practice, to try and get my fingers up to strength again, and to build up
the muscle memory of where the strings are, to get the coordination between
both hands, etc. I'm also going to be working through beginner's lessons
from a tutor application. I'm going to treat this like I'm the complete
novice I am and slowly work on improving.</p>
<p>There's no end goal; other than just get proficient enough that I can muck
about on my own and be happy that I can play the sorts of things I want to
be able to play.</p>
<p>Also, it's good to learn new stuff, <em>especially</em> new stuff that isn't just
more coding.</p></div>

      <div><p>According to YouTube I joined up on 2006-09-04. I don't think that's quite
correct. I <em>did</em> have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Video">Google
Video</a> account from very early
on, and uploaded a couple of things, and it got ported to a YouTube account
when Google <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">discontinued</a> the original video
service and settled on YouTube post-purchase. So I guess, in some respects,
it's kind of correct.</p>
<p>For most of that time I had hardly anything on there. Couple of videos to do
with the weather station I ran for a few years, some things related to my
photography, couple of things related to hacking with code; that's about it.</p>
<p>Then, a couple or so years back, when I got heavily into PCVR gaming, I
started to record my gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORCk74IQ3sfWsxg242qLwQ8g">upload
them</a>.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing there are 1,109 videos in the PCVR playlist, and
around 1,300 videos on my channel in total.</p>
<p>As for subscribers... eh, come on, few people are really interested in
watching some old bloke stumble around in VR, and I was <em>very</em> late to the
game anyway. But, apparently, around 350 lovely folk care enough about my
nonsense to subscribe.</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough for a YouTube play button, that's for sure. Only... I
now have a play button!</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3304.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I mean, sure, I have to build it myself...</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3305.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>...but it's something to show for all my efforts, I guess. ;-)</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3306.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>As for how I got it: presumably anyone/everyone with a YouTube account with
some content got the offer of goodies (I also got offered free coffee,
sausage rolls, socks, and a bunch of other stuff I've forgotten), and I was
lucky to claim one of these almost the instant the email turned up.</p>
<p>It's very likely the only YouTube play button I'll ever receive. I think it
will take pride of place on my desk.</p></div>

      <div><p>I have a LinkedIn profile more by accident than on purpose. For most of that
site's early days I just ignored it, even needing to go to the trouble of
aggressively marking emails from it as spam as it seemed to want to turn
itself into some sort of online networking cult, encouraging folk to send
invites to their contacts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn#Use_of_e-mail_accounts_of_members_for_spam_sending">or

But after job-seeking in late 2017 the recruiter who found me the position I
took up asked if I might join up and endorse him or some such nonsense and,
at the time, I thought what the hell.</p>
<p>Since then though I've mostly found it useless, and at times straight up
horrific. Don't even get me started on how a previous employer's push to
make everyone use their profiles as more company branding created a perfect
pool for people to go phishing in, while at the same time IT were on a
phishing-awareness push; a perfect illustration of how some people lose
their minds when it comes to that site.</p>
<p>The last year though, while working in a more FOSSy world, I've started to
dip my toe back in when it comes to linking to what we're building with
Textual. As such, I drop into the app once or twice a week and look to see
what other folk might be talking about too.</p>
<p>During a recent dip in I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="A suggestion from LinkedIn" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-suggestion.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Huh! Okay! That... that's actually kind of sensible! While I'm nowhere near
looking for anything else to do, showing off the public projects you care
about seems like a good idea. GitHub repos can be a good CV, I believe.</p>
<p>So I click through...</p>
<p><img alt="The project add form" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-add.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>And that's where it all falls apart. Pretty typical for LinkedIn I'd say.
Name, description, obsession with skills, obsession with building up a
social graph. But...</p>
<p>No link to the repo.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Link.</p>
<p>To.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Repo. O_o</p>
<p>o_O</p>
<p>I can't even.</p></div>

      <div><p>For as long as I've had a smartphone -- so ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> was released -- I've used
whatever search tool Google have had available as my way of searching for
stuff from my phone. Even when I made the switch to the iPhone, back when
the iPhone 11 was around, I still installed and used the Google Search app.</p>
<p>Since jumping ship from Android to iPhone, I've followed the usual track
that some do of "embracing the ecosystem", and it generally has paid off.
The more I lean into "the Apple way", the more stuff actually does work
together and work together well (I won't say "it just works", because that
can sometimes so <em>very</em> not be true, but really I do find that Apple's
ecosystem is more coherent and more stable than the one Google provided).
But searching for stuff... that stuck with the Google search app.</p>
<p>So, more as an experiment than anything else, starting this morning I've
removed the Google search app from the home screens of my iPhone and my iPad
and I'm going to force myself to use Spotlight to do all my searching, and
see how I get on with it.</p>
<p><img alt="Searching with Apple" src="/attachments/2023/10/14/apple-search.png#centre"></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to searching for stuff on the web, it's not going
to make a whole heap of difference; it's sill going to end up searching with
Google, but I do like the idea of search leaning into what Spotlight knows
about my stuff too.</p>
<p>Also, on my phone at least, it has the added benefit of freeing up a slot in
the dock at the bottom of the home screen.</p></div>
