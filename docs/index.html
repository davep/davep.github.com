  <div>
      <div><p>The urge to go gadget crazy, when getting a new hobby, or reviving an old
one, is a real thing. Having recently bought <a href="/2023/10/20/a-new-guitar.html">the new
guitar</a> with a view to trying to learn to
play properly, it's something I'm very mindful of and doing my best to
avoid. However, in the middle of the week I did crack and buy one little
extra thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Fender Mustang Micro" src="/attachments/2023/11/05/IMG_3488.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>As I said in the previous blog post about the guitar: I ended up getting
something that could be played acoustic without being annoying for
neighbours, which in turn meant I didn't need any sort of amp, or pedals,
etc. This has been working out just fine. But early last week, in an idle
moment, I was looking up what might be good options for a small amp for
practising should I want to and I stumbled on the <a href="https://www.fender.com/articles/parts-and-accessories/mustang-micro">Mustang
Micro</a>.</p>
<p>Reading up on it and checking out some reviews, it sounded <em>perfect</em> for my
setup. I enjoy living in a small space, so could do without a proper amp
kicking about, so something that just plugs right into the guitar sounded
ideal.</p>
<p>I added it to a list of things to keep in mind and then... a couple of days
later I was working from home which meant I'd be about to receive a delivery
if I was to place an order and... oops!</p>
<p>I've been using it every day since it turned up and I'm so damn impressed!
This thing might be small, but it's pretty mighty! For a complete notice
like me, to muck about, and fiddle and get some great sounds out of it, I
couldn't have asked for anything more.</p>
<p><img alt="The Options" src="/attachments/2023/11/05/IMG_3489.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>The range of amp styles is way more than I could possibly do justice right
now, but what's important for me is it's got versions that are nice and
clean, and versions that are dirty and distorted. The effects are pretty
much spot on too; there's everything I could ever possibly want there.</p>
<p>My only real complaint about it is that the UI itself -- small lights that
use colour to indicate their setting -- is terrible. I don't know how else
they <em>could</em> have done it, but I know this is bad. I am at least grateful
that it's standalone and doesn't require some app on a phone to control or
something like that.</p>
<p>I know it's going to take a while for me to get the most out of this, but
already it's giving me a bit more confidence to experiment and doodle away
in idle moments. Also, the USB connection means it can be plugged into my
Mac, presumably allowing me to record with GarageBand or similar software.
While I wouldn't use it to subject anyone to my terrible playing, that will
be something for me to explore in terms of keeping a record of my progress.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This follows on from my <a href="/2023/10/26/visual-selection.html">previous post</a>.
If you've not read that, it's worth having a dive in first for the
background.</p>
<p>The Ruby code I mention, that was written back in 2008, was actually a pair
of scripts. The first one, called <code>selection</code>, did what <code>visual-selection</code>
does, only <code>visual-selection</code> does it with a nice TUI interface: it takes a
random collection of letters and symbols and evolves them into a target
phrase.</p>
<p>As covered before: I don't remember all of the details of the conversation
that was going on at the time, but I do seem to remember something along the
lines of <em>"yes, but you start out and end up with something the same
length"</em> and <em>"nothing more complex is made"</em> (let's gloss over the whole
"complex" thing for now... well okay let's just gloss over it, end of story;
this is just a fun coding exercise).</p>
<p>What I do remember is that the seed of an idea was planted. Fine: how about
I start off with one small word, and using a list of English words as the
"fitness landscape" that the mutations had to survive in, mutate a
population over and over and see what happens. Would I "randomly" create
known words, with fewer letters, with the same letters, with more letters?</p>
<p>So this version of the code randomly did three forms of mutation: it would
randomly flip a letter, or randomly delete a letter, or randomly insert a
random letter. It would do this over and over and eliminate words that
aren't in the original list (the simple form of selecting for survival
within the landscape).</p>
<p>Like I said last time: never going to convince anyone of anything, but fun
to write some code.</p>
<p>This version became <code>selection2</code>.</p>
<p>So, having turned <code>selection</code> into a TUI application with Textual, I <em>had</em>
to do the same with this code...</p>
<p><img alt="Evolve Words" src="/attachments/2023/10/31/evolve-words.png#centre"></p>
<p>As before, because it's fun to do so, this leans heavily on the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a> and
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the app itself there's <a href="https://github.com/davep/evolve-words">a GitHub
repo</a> and it can also be
installed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/evolve-words/">from PyPi</a> using
<code>pipx</code>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Over the last few weeks I've had a couple of sessions of working on a
library to wrap <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plotext/">Plotext</a> -- a popular
terminal-based plotting library for Python -- so that it can easily be used
in Textual apps;
<a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/10/04/announcing-textual-plotext/"><code>textual-plotext</code></a>
is the result.</p>
<p>I feel it's come together pretty well</p>
<p>But... I've been itching to find a reason to use it in a project of my own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Back in the mid-2000s, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB</a>
systems were still the fashion, I used to hang out on a site that was
chiefly aimed at the atheist and secular humanist crowd. We'd get a good
number of drive-by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism">YEC</a> types who'd
want to argue (sorry... debate) and often talk nonsense about biology and
the like.</p>
<p>Now, I'm no biologist, I'm no scientist, I'm just a hacker who likes to
write code for fun and profit; so any time there was a chance to write some
code to help illustrate an idea I'd jump at the chance. I forget the detail
now -- this was back in 2008; 15 years ago as of the time of writing -- but
one time I remember a conversation was taking place where someone was just
flat out claiming that "random mutation" can only cause "loss of
information" and could never lead to a "desired result", or some such thing.</p>
<p>If you've ever had, read or watched those debates, you'll know the sort of
thing I mean.</p>
<p>So that got me thinking back then, could I write something that could give a
simple illustration of how this doesn't quite make sense?</p>
<p>So I had a little hacking session and came up with some Ruby code<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> that
did what I felt was the job. You'd give it a phrase you wanted it to
generate (a stand-in for the current "fitness landscape", in effect), it
would then generate a totally random string of that length, and then would
set about mutating it, finding mutations that were "fitter" than others (a
stand in for selection), breed the best two so far (randomly copy one chunk
from another to create a child), then repeat over and over.</p>
<p>When I first wrote it I wasn't sure what to expect; would it ever finish
given a reasonably large target string?</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>It was fun to code.</p>
<p>It got posted to the BB and of course wasn't in any way persuasive to them
(honestly I never expected it would be). I seem to recall it being
hand-waved away with calls of there obviously being an intelligent designer
involved<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the "meanwhile..." in this: a few times this year I've thought it
could be fun to rework this in Python (it's really not that complex after
all; just a string-chopping loop really) and use Textual to put a fun UI on
it.</p>
<p>So, that's what I did, complete with <code>textual-plotext</code> plot:</p>
<p><img alt="Visual Selection in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/26/visual-selection.png"></p>
<p>While, 15 years on, this isn't going to convince anyone of the underlying
point, I think it does serve a good educational purpose. It shows that you
can create a fun UI for the terminal, with Textual, with not a lot of code.
It also shows off how you can easily create dynamic plots. Plus -- and I
think this might be the really important one -- it shows you can write
"traditional" tight-loop code in a Textual application and <em>still</em> have a
responsive UI; all thanks to the <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/">worker
API</a>.</p>
<p>The heart of the code for this application is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">environment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Environment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;This is the target string we want to create!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_fit_found</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shit_happens</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sure, there's some detail in the <code>Environment</code> class, but you get the idea:
while we've not hit the target, let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg">life find a
way</a>. A loop like that would
totally bog down an application with a UI without some other work taking
place. With Textual and workers the resulting method in the application,
complete with code to send updates to the UI, really doesn't look much
different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@work</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thread</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exclusive</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I honestly think the worker API is one of the coolest things added to
Textual and I so often see people have real <em>"woah!"</em> moments when they get
to grips with it.</p>
<p>Anyway... I've covered science, religion, and how Ruby is better than
Python, so I'm sure I've annoyed almost everyone. Job done I guess. ;-)</p>

      <div><p>This seems to have started with iOS 17, and I can't narrow down the how and
the when of it happening, but over the last week or so I've found that every
couple of days Siri seems to lose their voice. By this I mean the high
quality voice that's used when they speak seems to disappear. I notice this
when I ask my phone or headphones a question or to do something, and I get a
really low-quality voice that speaks back to me.</p>
<p>The voice itself seems to be a version of the voice I normally use, but like
it's using an on-device much-cut-down version. If I go into the settings to
check what voice is selected, it's the one I normally use, but it wants to
download it again.</p>
<p><img alt="Downloading the voice all over again" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/siri-voice-loss.png"></p>
<p>Sure enough, once the download is complete all is good again. I've not kept
track of when it happens -- and I think I should from now on -- but it feels
like it happens every couple of days; I almost always notice it first thing
in the morning, the first time I ask the phone or the headphones something.</p>
<p>I hope it is some sort of iOS 17 weirdness and is gone when 17.1 turns up.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>This one has been brewing for a year, more or less. Now that I commute into
and back from Edinburgh most days of the working week, I find myself walking
past a couple of music shops. Seeing these reminds me of the days, back in
my 20s, when I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davepearson/albums/72157600225099352">mucked around in a couple of
bands</a>
and had fun making noises on a bass guitar. Since that time I've also owned
a cheap six string electric, which is currently in storage (and has been
since 2016) and an acoustic, which I have with me but I live in an apartment
building and I'm not an arsehole so I never play it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, walking past those shops has made me want to muck about on a
guitar again. I've never properly learnt the guitar, I've just managed to
learn enough chords to make some noises I like for my own amusement, but
even then I've not picked one up since around 2016 and what little I do know
is very rusty.</p>
<p>Add to the above: earlier this year I was at a friend's and admiring her
collection of bass and six string guitars and picked a couple up and
realised I could not play anything. It had been too long, I'd lost most
muscle memory and coordination, and what little knowledge I had.</p>
<p>So this made me want to fix this even more.</p>
<p>Given the apartment thing I decided on a plan: how about I get an eclectic,
and then some sort of amplification that would always rely on headphones?
Given such a setup I could knuckle down and try and learn properly.</p>
<p>So, this week, being on holiday, I told myself I'd pop into Edinburgh one
day and have a look at my options; perhaps even come home with something.
Yesterday was that day.</p>
<p>It didn't quite go to plan, but the outcome was that I ended up with
something to play.</p>
<p><img alt="My new Höfner" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3329.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>So, on getting into the shop, and explaining what I was after and why to the
chap in there, I tried the usual Stratocaster and Telecaster thing. Both
were fine (I think I liked the feel of the Telecaster more in my hand). I
had one eye on a Les Paul too, but never tried that. What I did see though
was this rather lovely black Höfner.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it's hollow body, so sort of has that acoustic thing going
on. This isn't what I wanted for playing in an apartment. But I had to try
it anyway. As soon as I started dabbling I was sold. The sound was enough
that it would be easy to pick up and play without having to faff with
amplification of any sort, on the other hand it was nowhere near as loud as
my acoustic. I felt like it bridged the gap between easy to pick up, and
versatile enough should I ever want to plug it into something.</p>
<p>And... let's be honest: it was black. Sooooo black. I like black.</p>
<p>Long story short... it had to come home with me!</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: most of my guitar stuff is still in storage, from when
I moved to Scotland, but I <em>did</em> find my old tin of plectrums and the tuner.</p>
<p><img alt="Standard guitar kit" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3330.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p><center>
    <em>(Yes, the tin was once mine and was once full; the early 90s were a
    different time)</em>
</center></p>
<p>I even found one of my old stands, that I've had since around 1991! So now
it's set up in my living room, next to the PCVR rig, ready to go at a
moment's notice.</p>
<p><img alt="On its stand, ready to go" src="/attachments/2023/10/20/IMG_3331.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>This is my plan now: each weekend I aim to put in at least an hour a day of
practice, to try and get my fingers up to strength again, and to build up
the muscle memory of where the strings are, to get the coordination between
both hands, etc. I'm also going to be working through beginner's lessons
from a tutor application. I'm going to treat this like I'm the complete
novice I am and slowly work on improving.</p>
<p>There's no end goal; other than just get proficient enough that I can muck
about on my own and be happy that I can play the sorts of things I want to
be able to play.</p>
<p>Also, it's good to learn new stuff, <em>especially</em> new stuff that isn't just
more coding.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>According to YouTube I joined up on 2006-09-04. I don't think that's quite
correct. I <em>did</em> have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Video">Google
Video</a> account from very early
on, and uploaded a couple of things, and it got ported to a YouTube account
when Google <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">discontinued</a> the original video
service and settled on YouTube post-purchase. So I guess, in some respects,
it's kind of correct.</p>
<p>For most of that time I had hardly anything on there. Couple of videos to do
with the weather station I ran for a few years, some things related to my
photography, couple of things related to hacking with code; that's about it.</p>
<p>Then, a couple or so years back, when I got heavily into PCVR gaming, I
started to record my gaming sessions and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUY2FpMDyORCk74IQ3sfWsxg242qLwQ8g">upload
them</a>.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing there are 1,109 videos in the PCVR playlist, and
around 1,300 videos on my channel in total.</p>
<p>As for subscribers... eh, come on, few people are really interested in
watching some old bloke stumble around in VR, and I was <em>very</em> late to the
game anyway. But, apparently, around 350 lovely folk care enough about my
nonsense to subscribe.</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough for a YouTube play button, that's for sure. Only... I
now have a play button!</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3304.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>I mean, sure, I have to build it myself...</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3305.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>...but it's something to show for all my efforts, I guess. ;-)</p>
<p><img alt="YouTube Lego Play Button" src="/attachments/2023/10/18/IMG_3306.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>As for how I got it: presumably anyone/everyone with a YouTube account with
some content got the offer of goodies (I also got offered free coffee,
sausage rolls, socks, and a bunch of other stuff I've forgotten), and I was
lucky to claim one of these almost the instant the email turned up.</p>
<p>It's very likely the only YouTube play button I'll ever receive. I think it
will take pride of place on my desk.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>I have a LinkedIn profile more by accident than on purpose. For most of that
site's early days I just ignored it, even needing to go to the trouble of
aggressively marking emails from it as spam as it seemed to want to turn
itself into some sort of online networking cult, encouraging folk to send
invites to their contacts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn#Use_of_e-mail_accounts_of_members_for_spam_sending">or
worse</a>.
But after job-seeking in late 2017 the recruiter who found me the position I
took up asked if I might join up and endorse him or some such nonsense and,
at the time, I thought what the hell.</p>
<p>Since then though I've mostly found it useless, and at times straight up
horrific. Don't even get me started on how a previous employer's push to
make everyone use their profiles as more company branding created a perfect
pool for people to go phishing in, while at the same time IT were on a
phishing-awareness push; a perfect illustration of how some people lose
their minds when it comes to that site.</p>
<p>The last year though, while working in a more FOSSy world, I've started to
dip my toe back in when it comes to linking to what we're building with
Textual. As such, I drop into the app once or twice a week and look to see
what other folk might be talking about too.</p>
<p>During a recent dip in I saw this:</p>
<p><img alt="A suggestion from LinkedIn" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-suggestion.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>Huh! Okay! That... that's actually kind of sensible! While I'm nowhere near
looking for anything else to do, showing off the public projects you care
about seems like a good idea. GitHub repos can be a good CV, I believe.</p>
<p>So I click through...</p>
<p><img alt="The project add form" src="/attachments/2023/10/16/linkedin-add.jpeg#centre"></p>
<p>And that's where it all falls apart. Pretty typical for LinkedIn I'd say.
Name, description, obsession with skills, obsession with building up a
social graph. But...</p>
<p>No link to the repo.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Link.</p>
<p>To.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Repo. O_o</p>

      <div><p>For as long as I've had a smartphone -- so ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Magic">HTC
Magic</a> was released -- I've used
whatever search tool Google have had available as my way of searching for
stuff from my phone. Even when I made the switch to the iPhone, back when
the iPhone 11 was around, I still installed and used the Google Search app.</p>
<p>Since jumping ship from Android to iPhone, I've followed the usual track
that some do of "embracing the ecosystem", and it generally has paid off.
The more I lean into "the Apple way", the more stuff actually does work
together and work together well (I won't say "it just works", because that
can sometimes so <em>very</em> not be true, but really I do find that Apple's
ecosystem is more coherent and more stable than the one Google provided).
But searching for stuff... that stuck with the Google search app.</p>
<p>So, more as an experiment than anything else, starting this morning I've
removed the Google search app from the home screens of my iPhone and my iPad
and I'm going to force myself to use Spotlight to do all my searching, and
see how I get on with it.</p>
<p><img alt="Searching with Apple" src="/attachments/2023/10/14/apple-search.png#centre"></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to searching for stuff on the web, it's not going
to make a whole heap of difference; it's sill going to end up searching with
Google, but I do like the idea of search leaning into what Spotlight knows
about my stuff too.</p>
<p>Also, on my phone at least, it has the added benefit of freeing up a slot in
the dock at the bottom of the home screen.</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview"><code>textual-astare</code></a> is another
Textual-based Python project that I've developed in the last year and I
don't believe I've mentioned on this blog. Simply put, it's a took for
viewing the abstract syntax tree of Python code, in the terminal.</p>
<p><img alt="astare in action" src="/attachments/2023/10/10/astare.png#centre"></p>
<p>I've just made a small update to it this evening after someone asked <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions/12">for a
sensible change I've been meaning to do for a
while</a>. When I
first read the request I <em>was</em> going to look at it next week, when I have
some time off work, but you know how it is when you sit at your desk and
have a "quick look".</p>
<p>So anyway, yeah, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-astview/">v0.8.0</a> is out
there and can be installed, with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker"><code>textual-fspicker</code></a></li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.39.0"><code>textual</code></a></li>
<li>Made it so you can open a directory to browser from the command line.</li>
<li>Made opening the current working directory the default.</li>
<li>Tweaked the way dark/light mode get toggled so that it's now
  command-palette-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the code does need a wee bit of tidying -- this was one of my
earliest apps built with Textual and my approach to writing Textual apps has
changed a fair bit this year, and Textual itself has grown and improved in
that time -- but it's still working well for now.</p></div>

      <div><p>In about a week's time I'll have had a GitHub account for 15 years! I can't
even remember what motivated me to create one now, but back in October 2008
I grabbed the <code>davep</code> account...</p>
<p><img alt="Making my account" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/account-made.png#centre"></p>
<p>...and then made my <a href="https://github.com/davep/dict.rb">first repo</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="First repo made" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/first-repo.png#centre"></p>
<p>My use of the site after that was <em>very</em> sporadic. It looks like I'd add or
update something once or twice a year, but I wasn't a heavy user.</p>
<p><img alt="First few years" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/first-few-years.png#centre"></p>
<p>Then around the middle of 2015 I seem to have started using it a lot more.</p>
<p><img alt="The next few years" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/next-few-years.png#centre"></p>
<p>This very much shows that during those years I was working on personal stuff
that I was making available in case anyone found it useful, but also leaning
heavily on GitHub as a (<em>a</em>, not <em>the</em>) place to keep backups of code I
cared about (or even no longer cared about). Quite a lot of that green will
likely be me having a few periods of <a href="/category/emacs.html">revamping my Emacs
configuration</a>.</p>
<p>The really fun part though starts about a year ago:</p>
<p><img alt="Working on FOSS full time" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/full-time.png#centre"></p>
<p>It's pretty obvious when I started working at Textualize, and working on a
FOSS project full time. This is, without a doubt, the most green my
contribution graph has looked. It looks like there's a couple of days this
year where I haven't visited my desk at all, and I think this is a good
thing (I try really hard to have a life outside of coding when it comes to
weekends), but I'm also delighted to see just how busy this year looks.</p>
<p>I really hope this carries on for a while to come.</p>
<p>Apparently, as of the time of writing, I've made 12,588 contributions that
are on GitHub. What's <em>really</em> fun is the fact that my first contribution
pre-dates my GitHub account by 9 years!</p>
<p><img alt="My very first contribution" src="/attachments/2023/10/01/very-first-contrib.png#centre"></p>
<p>This one's pretty easy to explain: this is back from when I was involved
with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_(programming_language)">Harbour</a>.
Back then we were using SourceForge to manage the project (as was the
fashion at the time), and at some point in the past whoever is maintaining
the project has pulled the full history into GitHub.</p>
<p>My <a href="/attachments/2023/10/01/contributions.png">contribution history on
GitHub</a> is actually older than my
adult son. I suspect it's older than at least one person I work with. :-/ <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
