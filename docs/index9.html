  </header>
  <div>
      <div><p>I'm going to file this one under "it seems really unnecessary, but it's also
kinda cool". While reading up about
<a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html">protocols</a>
the book I'm reading introduced the <code>ExpressibleBy*Literal</code> protocols, where
the <code>*</code> is one of a number of obvious literals. For example:
<code>ExpressibleByStringLiteral</code>. As you might imagine, it lets you create a
class that can be initialised with a literal value, as opposed to needing to
appear to call the constructor for a class.</p>
<p>So, for a silly example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Hello</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">ExpressibleByStringLiteral</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">what</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span>

    <span class="kr">required</span> <span class="kd">init</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">stringLiteral</span> <span class="n">what</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">what</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">what</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">say</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">what</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">!&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You could, of course, write this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">v1</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Hello</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;world&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">v1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">say</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>but because of <code>ExpressibleByStringLiteral</code> you can also write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">v2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;universe&quot;</span>
<span class="n">v2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">say</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, sure, in this case it saves you nothing, but this does also mean that
parameters of functions whose type uses one of the <code>`ExpressibleBy*Literal</code>
protocols can be passed a literal, rather than a "long-hand" instantiated
object. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">Greet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">_</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">h</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">say</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">Greet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;davep&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I can see that being quite handy.</p></div>

      <div><p>I'm going to file this one under "it makes perfect sense, but I don't think
it aids in making the code readable" -- something which I'm finding is a bit
of a theme with Swift.</p>
<p>In Swift <code>self</code> gets used and gets used in a way you'd expect from many
other languages. So far so good. But, it seems, <code>Self</code> is also a thing too,
and it's different from <code>self</code>. Whereas <code>self</code> is the current instance,
<code>Self</code> is the current type. So consider this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Greeting</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">func</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s">&quot;Ayup!&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s">&quot;Well hello there&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">emit</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">Self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">Greeting</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">emit</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When run, the output is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Ayup!
Well hello there
</code></pre></div>

<p>It makes sense that that's the case. I actually really like the ability to
use <code>Self</code> rather than having to use <code>Greeting</code>, but damn that's really
setting things up for either mistyping or misreading code. You're going to
want to hope that your development environment makes it super obvious what's
a value and what's a type when it comes to using font choices.</p></div>

      <div><p>Some languages favour a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">"one way to do
it"</a> approach, some favour
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">"there's more than one way to do
it"</a>.
I'm not sure I'm at a point where I have a feel for what Swift's approach
is, but I'm getting the impression it's more the latter than the former.</p>
<p>If there was one thing that made me think that, it was when I found out that
Swift's <code>bool</code> type has a <code>toggle</code> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nv">cool</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="kc">false</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">cool</span>
<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cool</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">toggle</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">cool</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>giving:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>swift<span class="w"> </span>run
<span class="nb">false</span>
<span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nb">false</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I can see a number of reasons why that's actually going to be handy -- the
main one being when you want to throw around a toggling method -- but it
still struck me as rather odd on first reading. I also think it's worth me
making a personal note about it because <code>foo.toggle()</code> isn't going to stand
out as much as <code>foo = !foo</code> when reading code. At least not for a short
while.</p></div>

      <div><p>Today's little "Swift TIL" is observers. While reading up on the language I
was delighted to find that it has observer support baked right into the
language, for any sort of variable. So code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nv">name</span>  <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;David&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kr">willSet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;About to change name from </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s"> to </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kr">didSet</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">old</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Name changed from </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">old</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s"> to </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">name</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;davep&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Does what you'd imagine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>About to change name from David to davep
Name changed from David to davep
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not only can I see how that'd be useful for the main sorts of purposes that
Swift is put to, I can think of many times when I'd have benefitted from
that in my general day-to-day work. Of course, you can create an observer
approach in any language really, but having an idiom that's part of the
language feels nice and tidy.</p></div>

      <div><p><a href="/2020/06/22/swift-til-1.html">Following on</a> with writing little notes to
myself so I remember some key things as I learn about Swift...</p>
<p>I sort of feel like this will make reading code a little harder, so it's one
I want to keep in mind. When calling an instance method, if it's not
ambiguous, you can omit <code>self.</code> from the call. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">outer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">String</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">outer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This makes me feel a little uneasy, and I strongly suspect I'll always use
<code>self.</code> when writing such code: I'm a big fan of the idea that we write code
for people, not for compilers.</p></div>

      <div><p>As <a href="/2020/06/21/a-second-attempt-to-learn-swift.html">I mentioned
yesterday</a>,
I'm going to make a small series of posts where I write down things that
I've stumbled on while getting to know Swift that are, for me personally,
worthy of note, different, unusual, cool, or just simply "WTF!?!".</p>
<p>Because learning new stuff is fun.</p>
<p>My first one is that you can use keywords as identifiers if you "escape"
them with backticks. Kind of like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;let&quot;</span>

<span class="bp">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm struggling to imagine a situation where I'd ever want to do this. I'm
still unsure if my reaction is "that's cool" or "WTF?!?".</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>It's five years ago this month that I bought myself my first macOS (then OS
X) device. After many years of having a Windows machine as my daily driver,
which was also my work machine (I worked from home), I decided it was high
time that I returned to having a Unix-a-like system on my desk too. For a
decade or so, starting in the later-90s, I'd had a GNU/Linux desktop. I
still had a Windows desktop (until a couple of years ago most of my work was
on DOS and Windows), but thanks to the wonders of a KVM, and later an X
server that ran on Windows, my personal hacking was done on a GNU/Linux
desktop.</p>
<p>But as things moved around, priorities changed, as life moved on, the
GNU/Linux boxes got retired and never quite replaced. Eventually, in 2015, I
found myself with the means and desire to recover that sort of setup. Long
story short, after a lot of reading up and weighing up options I decided
that the best option for a desktop Unix was... an iMac!</p>
<p>I loved it. Sure, <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">there were lots of little things on the surface that were
different or annoying or just plain not as cool as the Mac fans would tell
you</a>,
but under the hood I found what I needed: a Unix CLI with all the things I
knew well. And, of course, it ran GNU Emacs just fine; that was the really
important thing for me.</p>
<p>Pretty much right away I decided that it might be fun to learn the tools
necessary to develop native Mac apps, and perhaps even iOS apps. I
downloaded XCode, bought a book, and started working through it. Having got
that book, I decided it might be interesting to own an iOS device too. So,
sort of needing an MP3 player, and having no wish to get an iPhone, <a href="/2015/06/23/and-now-for-some-ios.html">I got
myself an iPod
Touch</a>. So I
was all set to devour the Swift book, write some stuff for OS X, create an
iOS app or two, and... life happened. Stuff cropped up that distracted me
from taking that further and I never really returned to working through the
book.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now and that initial iMac and iPod purchase spiralled a wee
bit. Next after the iPod was an iPad Mini, when my Nexus 7 was starting to
show its age and it was obvious that Google wasn't going to produce any more
good Android tablets. Then, when I needed a very portable Unix-a-like
machine for trips between where I was living and Edinburgh, <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">I got myself a
MacBook Air</a>.
Since then the iPod Touch has been replaced once, as has the iPad Mini. I
now also own an iPad and a MacBook Pro. Unless Apple screw up and turn Macs
into something unusable for developers (there are rumours), I imagine I'll
be using Apple devices for some time to come now.</p>
<p>And then, last month, having finally got frustrated with where Google were
going with Android and the Pixel series, I jumped ship to the iPhone 11.</p>
<p>As of right now I'm in a situation where I'm all about the Apple ecosystem
regarding hardware and operating systems (including for my work machine),
all of which is there to support my heavy use of the Google ecosystem
(actually, the one bit of Google hardware I still lean on heavily is the
Google Home -- I have 3 around my home).</p>
<p>So... given all of that, I thought it was time to look at returning to
learning Swift, with a view to writing some native macOS and i(Pad)OS stuff.
I soon realised that the book I'd bought back in 2015 was rather out of
date. It covers Swift 1.2 -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Version_history">we're now up to
5.2</a>!
Given this, and given I've forgotten pretty much everything I'd read at the
time, I decided I should start again from scratch.</p>
<p>This weekend I've started reading my way though <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ios-13-programming/9781492074526/"><em>iOS Programming
Fundamentals with
Swift</em></a>.
While this obviously has an emphasis on iOS, I'm already finding that the
first part of the book is a really great introduction to the Swift language
in general. The pace seems just right, and the way topics are grouped makes
it easy enough for me to skip over what's obvious (I don't need to know what
objected-oriented programming is, and what the difference between a class
and an object is, etc) and read up on the detail of this particular language
when it comes to general concepts I know (knowing the differences between a
class, struct and enum in the language is important, for example).</p>
<p>I've yet to write a line of code, but I'm fine with that. The book is
spending a lot of time introducing the language before encouraging you to
fire up XCode, and I'm okay with that. I'm never a fan of being asked to
write out code that I can't properly follow -- that just makes stuff look
like magic when it's far more educational to know what's going on. What I am
finding is I'm making lots of notes that are either <em>"oh, yeah, this is
cool, I like this idea!"</em> or <em>"WTF are you kidding me?!?"</em>. Which is really
nice -- it's always great to learn a new language that's a bit different
from what you normally use.</p>
<p>My plan then, over the next few weeks, it to keep at this and hopefully
document my journey. I think I'd like to write a short series of TIL-type
posts; nothing too long, just some new thing I read or discovered and my
reaction to it. So, if you happen to follow this blog, I apologise in
advance for any Swift-spam.</p>
<p>You have been warned. ;-)</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>Ever since the whole business of "light mode" and "dark mode" really kicked
off in the mobile OS world, I've been a fan of the dark modes. On both
Android and iOS/iPadOS, when apps became available with dark modes, I'd
switch to it. When the operating systems themselves adopted the switch,
that's what I went for. As well as having a love for all things black
(anyone who knows me personally will know that), I think it just looks
better on mobile devices. I can't quite say why, but it just works best for
me.</p>
<p>So, when macOS got a supported dark mode, I instantly switched it on,
obviously. Then, within a day, I switched it back to light mode.
Surprisingly it just didn't work for me, and I wasn't sure why. Since then
I've tried living with it a few times and it's rarely lasted more than a few
hours. There was something, something I couldn't quite put my finger on,
that didn't sit right.</p>
<p>Last Monday I decided to give it another go. This time, however, I thought
I'd figured it out. The "problem" was Emacs! As mentioned <a href="/2020/01/11/where-i-live-and-work.html">back in
January</a>,
for as long as I've used it (so since the mid-1990s), my Emacs has always
had a light background -- probably because that's how it came "out of the
box" (I'm talking Emacs in graphical mode here; I started with it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#1994%E2%80%931996:_The_%22Warp%22_years">OS/2
Warp</a>
and then moved to a GNU/Linux X-based desktop). I figured that the contrast
between the colour scheme of Emacs, and the rest of the machine, was the
issue here.</p>
<p>I spend most of my working day either in Emacs, or in
<a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> -- often rapidly switching between the
two. I've always run iTerm2 in the usual dark background mode with light
text. So I figured the problem was having a dark OS desktop, dark terminal,
and then a light editing environment. Eventually that'd feel wrong.</p>
<p>So I decided that, for the first time in about 25 years, I should give Emacs
a go with a dark mode. Taking a quick look at <a href="https://pawelbx.github.io/emacs-theme-gallery/">popular dark
themes</a> I noticed
<a href="https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow"><code>sanityinc-tomorrow-night</code></a>
looked easy on the eye, so I gave that a go (actually, I gave each of the
themes in that set a go, <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/commit/07f1c4c4c8c0c476f1e5e34845a834956d2be0c4">initially starting with
<code>sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties</code></a>,
but I finally settled on <code>sanityinc-tomorrow-night</code>).</p>
<p>To start with it didn't look too good; not because of a problem with the
theme itself, but because, over time, I'd made changes and tweaks to my
setup that assumed I'd be using my usual light theme. After some dabbling
and tinkering and trying things out, I got it looking "just so".</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-06-14 at 19.40.43.png" src="/attachments/2020/06/14/Screenshot 2020-06-14 at 19.40.43.png"></p>
<p>Having got that working, I then thought it would be nice to be able to have
Emacs -- at least on restart -- adapt to me switching between dark and light
mode on macOS. It turns out that detecting if macOS is in dark mode is easy
enough, the command <code>defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle</code> will emit <code>Dark</code>
if in dark mode. So, knowing that, I updated <a href="https://github.com/davep/is-a.el/blob/2b3eb99a213454536d789325f01477e3ce7eec87/is-a.el#L67-L70">my personal package for
checking things about the environment that Emacs is in to use that
information</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defconst</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">is-a-macOS-dark-mode-window-p</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">and</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="nv">is-a-macOS-window-p</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">string=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">shell-command-to-string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Dark\n&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;Are we running in a macOS window in dark mode?&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, as of now, my Emacs setup is such that, <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/f8389ac8f93b66c614ef82705929b86f01efc130/init.d/init-style.el#L15-L24">if I'm in graphical mode on
macOS and I'm in dark mode, Emacs will use a dark theme, otherwise it'll do
what it did before -- with a light background in a graphical mode and a more
Borland-a-like blue background when in CHUI
mode</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to have made a difference. Almost one week on my work Macbook is
still in dark mode, and I've switched both of my personal Macbooks, and my
iMac, into dark mode too. I think it's sticking this time. Next up is to
give some serious consideration to darkening the web in general. Only now am
I noticing just how damn bright most of it is!</p>
<hr>
<p>As a slight aside to the above, I've also made one other change to Emacs:
I've finally dropped the display of scroll bars. In the themes I'm using
they didn't look so great, appearing to be distracting. For the past 25
years I've had the scrollbars there, but never actually <em>used</em> them; all
they've ever done is serve as a visual aid to where I am in a file. Thing
is, I'm not sure I ever really pay that much attention to that either. So,
as a test, I've also been running with them turned off and, so far, I'm
really not noticing them been gone.</p>
<p>The habits we form that we convince ourselves make sense...</p></div>

  <div>
      <div><p>When I started with this version of the blog on Hashnode<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, my plan was to
try and write something at least once a week. I managed to do that as far as
January this year, give or take, but then things got a little busy, the
world got trickier, and... Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">you don't need me to tell you about
that</a>. Anyway, I'm back to
write some more and, hopefully, try and keep up with writing. I feel it'll
do me good.</p>
<p>I have been busy since January. Work has, as far as possible, carried on as
normal. The only big difference being I'm back working from home. It's an
odd turn of events personally given that I'd worked from home for 21 years,
then (with some trepidation) <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">went back to working in an
office</a>. Having got used to being in
an office and being around people, it took some adjusting to working alone
again.</p>
<p>So, on to the main point of this post... During that period I've spent a lot
more time at my machine than I would normally, and so it was inevitable that
I'd end up tinkering with <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d">my Emacs
configuration</a>. While it's true that
<a href="/2019/11/23/visual-evolution-of-emacs-config.html">there's hardly a week goes by where I don't tinker with some small
thing</a>, I try not to make
huge changes too often. Huge changes do happen though.</p>
<p>A handful of weeks back was another one of those times where I made a big
change.</p>
<p>After I <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">burnt my original <code>~/.emacs</code> file back in
2016</a> I've had an approach
where I've tried to make things as modular as possible, and as easy to clone
down to a new machine as possible. The design I came up with, <a href="/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html">especially
once I moved over to using
<code>use-package</code></a>, has
served me well. But there was always one thing that bothered me: the files
that handled the loading and configuration of packages were, in effect,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/tree/728e74376bf5606d9ef2d297e36cc2d35e159d64/init.d/packages">still three large monolithic
files</a>.
While this was better than a single monolithic <code>~/.emacs</code>, it still didn't
feel quite right.</p>
<p>Giving it a bit of thought, I decided that what I really wanted was a single
directory in which I could drop lots of small <code>.el</code> files that would handle
the loading and configuration of all sorts of packages. While it didn't gain
anything concrete, the idea felt tidier. Tidy is good. Feeling like the code
smell is good, is good too.</p>
<p>First though I needed a way to load multiple files, ideally within a whole
directory hierarchy, without needing to know in advance what files would be
there. After a little bit of tinkering I settled on <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/c3d53152b1adc9ba5e43baddb986870b3244b113/init.d/init-packages.el#L42-L46">this bit of
code</a>
that revolves around the use of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Contents-of-Directories.html"><code>directory-files-recursively</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">expand-file-name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;init.d/packages.d/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">user-emacs-directory</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">file-exists-p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cl-loop</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">directory-files-recursively</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">source</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rx</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.el&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">             </span><span class="nb">do</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">load</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file-name-sans-extension</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">use</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Simply put, this code finds every file in and below
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/tree/master/init.d/packages.d"><code>~/.emacs.d/init.d/packages.d/</code></a>
whose name ends in <code>.el</code> (note the use of a regular expression, using
<a href="/2019/12/01/being-phony-and-lispy-regular-expressions.html"><code>rx</code></a>
to create it), removes the extension from the name, and loads it with <code>load</code>
(dropping the extension means <code>load</code> can decide if it wants to load the
compiled version of the code, or the source, depending on what's available).</p>
<p>After writing that I could then start to populate
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.d/packages.d/</code> with lots of smaller files that handled the
loading of packages. In some cases there's a file just for one package, in
other cases there's a file that handles a logical grouping of packages
(where there are obvious direct dependencies, or where one package is
designed to extend the other, etc). For now I've decided to break things
down into three directories that map to the three monolithic files I had
before:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2020-06-07 at 16.36.28.png" src="/attachments/2020/06/07/Screenshot 2020-06-07 at 16.36.28.png"></p>
<p>However, I'm not totally wedded to this design and I may change this as time
goes on.</p>
<p>While I've not spent any time properly testing it out, I've also not really
noticed any obvious impact on startup speed. However, this tends not to be a
real concern for me. I seldom <em>start</em> Emacs anyway. I always have it running
<a href="https://github.com/davep/e">and use <code>emacsclient</code> as my editor in most places so files open instantly
in the running version of Emacs</a>.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Late on last year I stumbled on an article about
<a href="https://www.getdnote.com/">dnote</a>. Annoyingly, I can't recall now where I
saw it, but I made a reminder to look at it over my Christmas break.</p>
<p>Dnote looked like a tool that would fill a hole I had in how I work. When it
comes to making notes about things, and keeping things for future reference,
I use a few tools, each one being just right (for me) for the job in
question. I use <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> to track documents and
other household type things. I use <a href="https://www.google.com/keep/">Keep</a> to
make notes about stuff I need to remember short-term (say, the size of a
space in my bedroom that I want furniture to go in) and also to record notes
while in meetings at work. I use <a href="https://journey.cloud/">Journey</a> to keep a
journal about... anything, really. Finally, <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep">I use
Pinboard</a> to keep hold of URLs I might want to
go back to (I also use it to create a to-read list).</p>
<p>Amongst all of this, however, I felt I was missing something for keeping
track of things that don't really fall into any of the categories above.
Mostly this would be work-based or hacking-based things that are short and
sweet but I don't always use enough to easily remember. I wanted just the
right tool that would let me ferret away useful one-liners, remind myself of
obscure switches that get used once or twice a year, etc.</p>
<p>After reading up on dnote it seemed pretty clear that this was just such a
tool.</p>
<p>After getting back to the office at the start of this month I decided to
make use of it and see how it went. My idea was simple: I'd record any "TIL"
stuff that I might want to remember in the future, as well as recording
things I need now and again but can't always remember.</p>
<p>So far it's working quite well. I like that it has a simple CLI. I like that
it's got a backend that you can use to sync between different machines. I
like that it's got a web interface that's mobile-friendly. I like that <a href="https://github.com/dnote/dnote">it's
Free Software</a> and so you can host your own
server if you wish.</p>
<p>I found I liked it enough that, of course, I felt the need to start <a href="https://github.com/davep/dnote.el">a
simple Emacs wrapper for the CLI</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment dnote.el is designed to be a simple capture system. There are
commands for capturing a one-liner (entered in the Emacs mini-buffer), for
capturing the content of the current buffer, and for capturing
freshly-entered multi-line text, entered in a buffer that uses
<code>markdown-mode</code>. There's also a command for syncing notes if you have
configured dnote to talk to a backend.</p>
<p>What I don't have right now is the ability to navigate and view notes. So
far I've not really felt the need for that because the CLI approach works so
well. Longer-term though I can see my tweaking this and adding in commands
for searching, viewing, editing and deleting notes.</p>
<p>But, for now, if you've not had a look at dnote, I'd highly recommend having
a play and seeing if it makes sense for you. And, if it does, and you're an
Emacs user, perhaps dnote.el will be useful too?</p></div>
