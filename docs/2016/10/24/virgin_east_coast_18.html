<meta name="description" content="Late on last week some progress was made with the issue of no longer being able to contact Mike at Virgin East Coast.

    <p>Late on last week some progress was made <a href="/2016/10/19/virgin_east_coast_17.html">with the issue of no longer being
able to contact Mike at Virgin East Coast</a>.
After chasing up via twitter (mentioning the MD as well as the normal
support account) I finally got a reply from the support account, saying
they'd get a message to Mike and let him know what was going on.</p>
<p>I wasn't really very hopeful about it, if I'm honest. If I couldn't get a
reply from him via the channels I'd normally used what hope was there that
I'd get a reply this way?</p>
<p>The following day was mostly spent traveling but my phone was on and always
to hand. I never received any call. However, late in the day I did get an
email! This was the first direct contact, that replied to an attempt to
contact him on the current issue, I'd had from the Customer Relations
Manager since the previous month.</p>
<p>Here's what he said (quoted in full):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My sincere apologies for the silence, I have been away and it was remiss
of my not to advise my regular contacts, of my colleagues details.</p>
<p>If you can leave this with me I will certainly be in contact early next

<p>I am, of course, a little skeptical of this at the moment. A few times
before I've been told they'll be in contact "early next week", or something
similar, and nothing has happened. It'll be interesting to see if this will
be different.</p>
<p>Will I get an update? Will I finally get a call about the Ticket Wallet app?
Will the extra tickets turn up?</p>
