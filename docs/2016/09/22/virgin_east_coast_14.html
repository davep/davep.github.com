<meta name="description" content="It&#39;s now about 3 weeks since my last post about my exploits in getting a problem solved with Virgin East Coast so now&#39;s a good time for a little update. Two things were &#34;outstanding&#34; the last time I wrote about this. One was that Mike (the customer relations manager in the Virgin East Coast MD&#39;s office) wanted us to meet up for a coffee and a chat about my issues and how things were progressing, etc. Sadly I wasn&#39;t able to make the original date we&#39;d picked out as a possible so another date was arranged. At least, it was kind of arranged. It was noted that this week might be a good time to meet and I&#39;d written back to him to say that Wednesday 21st would be good. Since then I&#39;ve had no reply at all. The second thing that is outstanding is having someone call me about the issues with the Ticket Wallet app. I&#39;ve yet to receive a call from the person who originally phoned me and who I missed (and who I chased up every day for a week afterwards). I was then told by Mike, about 2 weeks or so back, that that person&#39;s manager would call me instead and that I should expect a call early last week. That call didn&#39;t happen. Didn&#39;t happen early last week, late last week, at all last week. It&#39;s now Thursday this week and I&#39;ve still not had a call. Just this morning I&#39;ve chased up both of the above. It&#39;s now over 3 months since I first reported the Ticket Wallet app problem and I seem to be no closer to seeing it resolved, or even having an explanation as to the cause of the problem." />
