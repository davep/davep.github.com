    <p>It's now a week
<a href="/2016/09/22/virgin_east_coast_14.html">since I last wrote an update</a> and,
given that I'm sat on a Virgin East Coast train right now, I thought I'd do
another.</p>
<p>As mentioned last time, I'm currently waiting for a call from someone at
Virgin East Coast regarding the ongoing situation with the Android Ticket
Wallet application. It's
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">now over 3 months since I first ran into the problem</a>
(and, of course, ran into all the issues of trying to get some sensible help
and response from them) and nothing has really improved:</p>
<p><img alt="Still can't log in" src="/attachments/2016/09/29/Screenshot_20160929-125339.png"></p>
<p>It's now <a href="/2016/08/10/virgin_east_coast_12.html">around six weeks</a> since I
was promised a call from someone who works on the application; a call that
did come the once but I couldn't answer at the time (I'm not the sort of
person to fiddle with a phone while driving) and which I attempted to return
for the better part of 2 weeks afterwards but never even got an answer to

Mike's reserving of seats for me when I need them -- I do find that booked
seats take a lot of stress out of traveling) I'd really love to get to the
