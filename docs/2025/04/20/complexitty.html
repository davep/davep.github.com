<meta name="description" content="Much like Norton Guide readers or the 5x5 puzzle, code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto exercises. I&#39;ve written versions in many languages, and messed with plots in some different environments, as varied as in VR on the web to wearable items. Back in the early days of my involvement with Textualize I wrote a deliberately worst-approach version using that framework. The whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job. Later on I did a second version that targets Textual. This time it did a better job and was the catalyst for building textual-canvas. This version was intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible version mentioned above, I still wasn&#39;t 100% happy with the way it worked. Recently I did some maintenance work on textual-canvas, cleaning up the repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at textual-mandelbrot and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn&#39;t really sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick off a fresh stand-alone application. Complexitty is the result. Right now the application has all the same features as the mandelexp application that came with textual-mandelbrot, plus a couple more. Also it&#39;s built on top of the common core library I&#39;ve been putting together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on I&#39;ll add more features. As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with comprehensive help for commands and key bindings. and there&#39;s also a command palette that helps you discover (and run) commands and their keyboard bindings. Complexitty is licensed GPL-3.0 and available via GitHub and also via PyPI. If you have an environment that has pipx installed you should be able to get up and going with: pipx install complexitty It can also be installed with Homebrew by tapping davep/homebrew and then installing complexitty: brew tap davep/homebrew brew install complexitty" />

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/">Norton Guide readers</a> or
the <a href="https://github.com/davep?tab=repositories&amp;q=5x5&amp;type=&amp;language=&amp;sort=">5x5
puzzle</a>,
code that has fun with the Mandelbrot set is another one of my goto
exercises. I've written versions in many languages, and messed with plots in
some different environments, as varied as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ytRZrHL34">in VR on the
web</a> to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Self-Documenting-Mandelbrot-by-davepearson/1341910.0S66D">wearable
items</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of <a href="https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html">my involvement with
Textualize</a> I
<a href="https://github.com/davep/trMandelbrot">wrote a deliberately worst-approach
version</a> using that framework. The
whole thing was about taking a really silly approach while also
stress-testing Textual itself. It did the job.</p>
<p>Later on I did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot">a second version that targets
Textual</a>. This time it did a
better job and was the catalyst for building
<a href="https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/"><code>textual-canvas</code></a>. This version was
intended more to be a widget that happened to come with an example
application, and while it was far more better than the on-purpose-terrible
version mentioned above, I still wasn't 100% happy with the way it worked.</p>
<p>Recently I did some maintenance work on <code>textual-canvas</code>, cleaning up the
repository and bringing it in line with how I like to maintain my Python
projects these days, and this prompted me to look back at
<code>textual-mandelbrot</code> and rework it too. Quickly I realised it wasn't really
sensible to rewrite it in a way that it would be backward compatible (not
that I think anyone has ever used the widget) and instead I decided to kick
off a fresh stand-alone application.</p>
<p><a href="https://complexitty.davep.dev/">Complexitty</a> is the result.</p>
<p><img alt="Complexitty on startup" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty.png"></p>
<p>Right now the application has all the same features as the <code>mandelexp</code>
application that came with <code>textual-mandelbrot</code>, plus a couple more. Also
it's built on top of <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual-enhanced">the common core
library</a> I've been putting
together for all my own terminal-based Python applications. As time goes on
<a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ATODO%20label%3AEnhancement">I'll add more
features</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed in with Complexitty" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-red.png"></p>
<p>As with most of my recent TUI-based projects, the application is built with
comprehensive help for commands and key bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The help screen" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-help.png"></p>
<p>and there's also a command palette that helps you discover (and run)
commands and their keyboard bindings.</p>
<p><img alt="The command palette" src="/attachments/2025/04/20/complexitty-commands.png"></p>
<p>Complexitty is licensed GPL-3.0 and available <a href="https://github.com/davep/complexitty">via
