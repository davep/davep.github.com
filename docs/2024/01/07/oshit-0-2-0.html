<meta name="description" content="This is actually the second release of OSHit since I first announced it a week back, and I&#39;ll get to that other release in a moment. I&#39;ve just published v0.2.0, which isn&#39;t a very substantial release, but which bumps the required version of Textual to v0.47.1 and has some fun with the new nested CSS feature. Underlying the point of this release was me taking a &#34;real world&#34; application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in part to get a feel for how and when it&#39;s useful, but also to give it a proper test in a &#34;proper&#34; application. In doing so I think I&#39;ve found one bug. Dogfooding is always a good idea. The main visible change in this release is I&#39;ve played around with the look of the comments dialog a bit: I&#39;m still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I started out with. Another change I made was also to the comments dialog. Before, if you performed the &#34;expand comments&#34; action on a comment card that already had its comments expanded, it would move focus to the first child comment; this was a deliberate choice that felt right at the time. Having used the app for a few days now I&#39;ve realised that making it an open/close toggle is far more useful. So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done. Now... as for the previous release I mentioned above. That was a fun one. Back when I released v0.1.0 some joker decided that it would be fun to submit the blog post about it to the Orange Site. The comments there went as you&#39;d expected: Some riffed off the opening paragraph, ignoring the tool itself. Some riffed off the opening paragraph in self-reflective way. Some riffed off the opening paragraph in a &#34;I never see the problem&#34; way. One or two did the usual &#34;why even bother building that when $TOOL_OF_CHOICE exists?&#34; dance to show their terminal purity. One or two posted genuinely useful links to other similar projects. The biggest tree of comments was kind of a fight. One comment caught my eye though; someone reported having a problem running it. My initial thought on reading it was &#34;my dude, seriously, you&#39;re going to report the problem in some random comment on HN rather than raise an issue with the author?!?&#34;. For once I was wrong to be so cynical. So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I&#39;d been intentionally reckless while writing the original code, and hadn&#39;t gone back to the API code I&#39;d written and made it behave before doing the initial release. All of which is to say: if you run into a problem with some FOSS project, be like @mihaitodor. Issue that thing so the developer gets to know about it; don&#39;t assume they&#39;ll be reading some random comment section, social media site or Discord server! That and don&#39;t make 500+ HTTP requests at once; that might not end well for some." />

    <p>This is actually the second release of OSHit since <a href="/2024/01/01/oshit.html">I first announced it a
week back</a>, and I'll get to that other release in a
moment.</p>
<p>I've just published v0.2.0, which isn't a very substantial release, but
which bumps the required version of Textual to
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.1">v0.47.1</a> and
has some fun with <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.0">the new nested CSS
feature</a>.</p>
<p>Underlying the point of this release was me taking a <em>"real world"</em>
application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in
part to get a feel for how and when it's useful, but also to give it a
proper test in a <em>"proper"</em> application. In doing so <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3969">I think I've found one
bug</a>.</p>
<p>Dogfooding is always a good idea.</p>
<p>The main visible change in this release is I've played around with the look
of the comments dialog a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="OSHit you have comments" src="/attachments/2024/01/07/oshit-comments.png"></p>
<p>I'm still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I
started out with.</p>

  way.</li>
<li>One or two did the usual <em>"why even bother building that when

<p>So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I'd been intentionally
