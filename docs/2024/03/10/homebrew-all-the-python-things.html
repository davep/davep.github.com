  <div>
    <p>Over the past year and a half I've written a <em>lot</em> of Python code, and a lot
of that Python code has been Textual applications; most of those Textual
applications have been very quick demonstration or test applications built
to help support someone asking for help; some of them have been less-trivial
applications written in my own time and for my own use and amusement. Of
them I'd say there are two near-daily-drivers, and a couple that I either
have more plans for, or like to maintain just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Those latter applications are all ones that <a href="https://pypi.org/user/davepearson/">I've deployed to
PyPI</a>, and because of that are all ones
that I've recommenced be installed using
<a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/"><code>pipx</code></a>. During that time though I've had
half an inclination to make them <a href="https://brew.sh/">installable via
Homebrew</a>. While probably not installable from the core
Homebrew repository<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, at least installable from a "tap"<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> that's under
my own GitHub account or something.</p>
<p>To this end I've had <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew">a blog post about packaging Python apps for
Homebrew</a>
saved in Pinboard for a while now, and every time I look at it I think
<em>"this is a lot of faff, maybe later"</em>. Today was that "later".</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was <em>way</em> easier than I first realised. The evolution
of today pretty much went like this:</p>
<h2>Deciding to use a single repository as the "tap"</h2>
<p>The blog post above seemed to suggest that for every application repository
you want a tap for, you probably want a parallel <code>homebrew-</code>-prefixed
repository. This in turn would suggest that every time someone wants to
install one of your tools, they'd need to add a new tap<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. As I looked at
it this seemed like way too much faff, so in the end I decided <a href="https://github.com/davep/homebrew-homebrew">to create a
single repository that I'd keep all my formula files
in</a>. The naming of
<code>homebrew-homebrew</code> meant that the tap name would simply be
<code>davep/homebrew</code>.</p>
<p>Simple and clean, I think: things for homebrew, things that can be installed
via homebrew, that come from davep. To add the tap it's simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Ensuring that all my applications and libraries publish source</h2>
<p>Although it seems that it might be (possibly, maybe, perhaps, who can tell?)
deprecated, it looked like
<a href="https://github.com/tdsmith/homebrew-pypi-poet"><code>homebrew-pypi-poet</code></a> was a
tool I'd need to do all the heavy work on making the formula file. A quick
test threw up a problem where it was complaining that my test package (one
of my own applications) didn't have an <code>sdist</code>. Sure enough, through nothing
more than never having bothered to make it happen, the source of my
libraries and applications wasn't been uploaded to PyPI when I published.</p>
<p>So I went through some of my repositories and fixed that, making patch
releases as I went.</p>
<h2>Making a <code>Makefile</code> to let me be lazy</h2>
<p>The next thing to do was to figure out the most lazy way of building the
formula files. From what I could see the main steps to making all of this
work were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a venv and activate it</li>
<li>Install <code>homebrew-pypi-poet</code></li>
<li>Install the package you want to package for Homebrew</li>
<li>Run <code>poet</code> to make the formula</li>
</ul>
<p>Seemed simple enough. For all sorts of lazy reasons I still tend to use
<code>pipenv</code> to get things done quickly, and that seemed to work fine here too.
I'm also a fan of <code>PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=true</code> which makes things clean and
tidy, so I figured a rule in a <code>Makefile</code> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">clean</span><span class="o">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-rf<span class="w"> </span>.venv
<span class="w">        </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>Pipfile<span class="w"> </span>Pipfile.lock
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.12
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--dev<span class="w"> </span>homebrew-pypi-poet
</code></pre></div>

<p>would be fine to make a clean venv ready to build the formula, and then I'd
have a rule for the package itself that depended on the above, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">oshit</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">clean</span>
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oshit
<span class="w">        </span>pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>poet<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>oshit<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>Formula/oshit.rb
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Fixing the package description</h2>
<p>The above was great, and worked really well. But there was one issue that I
could see: the resulting formula file always had this <code>desc</code> inside it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">desc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Shiny new formula&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>From what I could see there was no way to tell <code>poet</code> what I wanted the
description to be, and neither did I want to have to remember to edit that
line each time I regenerated the formula file. So <code>sed</code> to the rescue then I
guess, with this sort of thing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sed<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;s/Shiny new formula/The actual text I want/&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span>Formula/coolapp.rb
</code></pre></div>

<h2>The result</h2>
<p>The result of all of this is that I now have <a href="https://github.com/davep/homebrew-homebrew">a repository that I or anyone
else can use as a tap</a> to be
able to install my stuff using the <code>brew</code> command. So now if you want a
little Hacker News reader for the terminal but you don't want to be messing
with installing <code>pipx</code> and the like, but you do use <code>brew</code> on your machine,
it's just this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>tap<span class="w"> </span>davep/homebrew
$<span class="w"> </span>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>oshit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Fingers crossed it all "just works" when I next upgrade one of those
packages. I will, of course, have to remember to go into
<code>davep/homebrew-homebrew</code> and <code>make the-app</code> for the relevant application,
and then commit and push the changes, but that's really not too difficult to
remember and do.</p>
<p>Hopefully it'll then all just work.</p>
