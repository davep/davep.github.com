This is my blog, hosted on GitHub pages. It's an experiment, a learning
exercise, a reason to bang on a keyboard about stuff I want to bang on a
keyboard about while not doing it in the usual places.

# TODO:

- Sort out tags.
  At the moment tags don't actually link to anything or provide anything
  useful becuase of the fact that I'm hosting on GitHub pages and
  Jekyll plugins don't work there. While I could use the "host as static
  pages" solution that sort of seems to miss the point of using this setup.
  As such I want to find a better way of doing this that's as dynamic as
  possible *and* keeps things hosted in the repo.
- Sort out an "overview" view of posts (by month, or something)
