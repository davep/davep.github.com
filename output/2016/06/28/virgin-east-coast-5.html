    <p>Quick update on where things are at with the attempt to get help with the
apparent inability to log into the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app using
an otherwise perfectly valid account...</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="/2016/06/27/virgin_east_coast_4.html">yesterday</a> I had an
email from them. I replied (after writing yesterday's blog post):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm very concerned and very confused by your question about if I've even
registered with the main website. Yes, I have. I've confirmed this more
than once now. During my first phone conversation with support I was told
I wasn't in the system and then, when I demonstrated that I had to be, I
was magically "found" after some magic "fix" was applied on the fly. Now
I'm being told I don't exist again. </p>
<p>I seem to be going backwards with this rather than going forwards, and
what's even more frustrating is that any question I ask seems to get
ignored while I keep being asked the same basic questions time and again.</p>
<p>Yes, I did register with the main website. That's how I found there was an
Android app that works with it. That's how I followed the link to
it. That's how I found the support report form and managed to drop you a
line in the first place.</p>
<p>So, just so I'm 100% clear on this: which email address are you looking
for? How are you looking for it? Where are you looking for it? How come
someone looked for it before, didn't find it, and then found it when
looking again? If I'm not in the system how is it possible for me to log
into the main website?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also added a couple of screenshots, with explanation, that shows me
logging in with the address they claim doesn't exist in their system.</p>
<p>I've had no reply to my questions so far. I've had no reply at all so far.</p>
<p>After posting yesterday's post I did the usual thing of tweeting it and,
obviously, mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a>
in the tweet.</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good 10 days into the <a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC">@Virgin_TrainsEC</a> support saga and there’s no end in sight: <a href="https://t.co/ZfV0lR4DQL">https://t.co/ZfV0lR4DQL</a></p>&mdash; Dave Pearson (@davepdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/747362449876197377">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p></center></p>
<p>This lead to a little exchange on twitter where I mentioned that the main
reason I was trying to switch to Virgin's own system, rather than use
someone line TheTrainLine, was so that I could get the free WiFi and save
myself a tenner each trip.</p>
<p>All credit to Virgin East Coast: they contacted me directly and have
provided me with 10 one-use WiFi access codes to keep me going while this
gets sorted out. It's not a solution to the problem, but it does remove the
extra cost I was trying to get rid of for the next 5 standard class round
trips (I sometimes sneak in a first class journey if the price is too good
to ignore).</p>
<p>So.... no still no solution, but some welcome help from them to be going on
with. Can't grumble at that.</p>
