                <p>This morning I called back on
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">the number I'd been given yesterday evening</a>. I
explained briefly why I was calling and how I was returning someone's call
but, sadly, ended up back in support script-following hell: they started
asking for booking reference and all that stuff again. I stopped them,
explained the issue <em>again</em>, and they then started to ask for ticket details
and so on.</p>
<p>Deeply frustrating. The problem I had was that I was trying to set
everything up so I could even stand a chance of booking a ticket. How could
I have a ticket I could tell them about if I'd not even got to that part?</p>
<p>When I made this clear, in as polite but firm way as possible, I was passed
onto that person's supervisor.</p>
<p>As luck would have it he was the person who'd called and left a message last
night. He quickly filled me in on what was happening, saying they weren't
sure what the problem was but that the details had been passed to the tech
people. He also asked if he could send me an email with some questions in it
that would help get to the bottom of things; he said it would ask things
like OS type and version, device type, etc. It all seemed to make sense</p>
<p>I said I'd be happy to and we left it at that.</p>
<p>I've had the email. This is what it asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Origin and Destination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gah! Here we go again. The whole support thing appears to be predicated on
the idea that you're having a problem getting somewhere. They seem to not
understand that if you can't even use the system in the first place you
can't even have booked a ticket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - Date and Time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a ticket, there can be no date and time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - Number of passengers and railcards if any</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing a pattern here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - Ticket name and price</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... erm... hello?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Browser name &amp; version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally! We're getting somewhere! Only... my problem isn't in a web
browser. My problem is with logging in with their Android app. I'm sure I
mentioned this to them at least once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 - Screenshot if possible showing the error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay! Finally! We're getting somewhere! I pasted in the screenshot that was
included in yesterday's blog post. You know the one. The one where it's just
some text that says the username and password are invalid. Because... images
are better than the text in them, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 -  Name of the TOC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no clue what this means. TOC? What the heck is a TOC?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8 - Email address of the user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This I can do! I know this one! (I still suspect that this is the cause of
the problem).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9 - Booking ref</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaaarrrrrggghhhhhh!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Screen shot showing exact error and exact steps to recreate the error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait... didn't I get asked that in question 6? How is this screenshot going
to be different from the other screenshot? Still, at least it asks for the
steps to recreate now. So I answered that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new account on the Virgin East Coast website. Ideally use an
   email address that contains both a full stop and a plus sign, as mine
   does. Also ensure that you use a password that is the same length as
   mine.</li>
<li>Log in and look at registered devices.</li>
<li>See there are none and follow the links it provides to the applicable app
   that will result in a device being registered. In this case the Ticket
   Wallet.</li>
<li>Download and install on a suitable Android device.</li>
<li>Attempt to log in and, likely, find that you're told that the username
   and password is incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
So that's all sent off now. Now I wait for another call back at some point
in the near future.</p>
<p>Curious how the thing it didn't ask was what app I was using, what version
it was, what mobile device it was being used on, what OS, what OS version,
etc...</p>
