  <div>
    <p>After my <a href="/2016/10/27/virgin_east_coast_19.html">last post</a> I sent off an
email to chase up what was happening with the promised phone calls about the
Ticket Wallet app and the general delays with getting things sorted. Here's
what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi again Mike.</p>
<p>It's now a week since you replied and, I think it's fair to note, it's no
longer "early" this week. I've had no call -- neither form yourself nor
from anyone related to the Ticket Wall App -- and I've not received the
promised tickets either. While I do try to be patient I have to admit that
it's starting to get very frustrating, being made lots of promises about
progress that simply never happen. This has been going on for months now
and I'm always having to chase things up.</p>
<p>I'd very much appreciate it if you could explain to me what's going on,
and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A while later I got a reply. He said he'd be getting the tickets in the post
the following day (so a Friday, which I think I can safely say isn't the
start of the week) and would also phone me.</p>
<p>The following day he did keep his promise. He called (I managed to miss him
the first time, but when I was finally free I called back and we got to
chat). He promised I'd get some more tickets early next week and also that
someone with technical knowledge would finally call about the app problem.</p>
<p>I have, of course, been here before. This is exactly the promise that was
made a couple of months ago. It's easy to make the promise, apparently not
so easy to deliver on it (or address the issue of not delivering on it).</p>
<p>So now I wait. Again. I'll be sure to update when something happens (or
doesn't).</p>
