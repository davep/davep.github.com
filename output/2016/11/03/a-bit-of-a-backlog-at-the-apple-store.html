</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Over the past couple or so
weeks <a href="/2016/04/28/i-now-own-a-macbook.html">my Macbook air</a> has started to
develop a minor, but irritating, hardware problem. Simply put, the left
shift key fails now and again. I can press it and it does nothing. It's
irritating because it messes with the flow of typing (especially when
writing code) and the key also feels like it's sticking or clicking in a way
that's different from all the other keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Keyboard" src="/attachments/2016/11/03/MacbookKB.jpeg"></p>
<p>Given that I pass through Edinburgh on a pretty regular basis I thought I'd
drop in and have a quick chat with someone about it. While I didn't expect a
fix there and then (although finding out it was a trivial issue would have
been nice) I was hoping someone could take a quick look and let me know what
might be going on.</p>
<p>So, this morning, on the way to Waverley Station, I dropped in to the Apple
store on Princes Street.</p>
<p>I walked in and looked for a member of staff, all seemed to be busy to start
with but one soon noticed that I looked a little lost and asked me if they
could help. I explained the issue and she said I needed to pop upstairs to
chat with the staff up there.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>So, I headed up to the first floor and caught the attention of another
member of staff. Having explained the exact same thing to them I was told I
needed to speak with yet another staff member. The chap I needed to speak to
had a queue (yes, a physical queue of people) waiting to speak to him.</p>
<p>I joined the queue.</p>
<p>About five minutes later I got to speak with him. I, again, explained the
problem and was told that looking at it would be no problem and they could
do so at around 4pm. This was at about 10am. Having gone through 3 people
and spent 10 minutes doing so I found out that there was a six hour queue to
have someone actually take a quick look at the issue.</p>
<p>By that time I wouldn't even be in the same country, let alone the same
city. So I had to say thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p>So now it looks like I have to make an appointment for some point in the
future and make a special trip into Edinburgh just so someone can check out
a sticky key on my Macbook.</p>
<p>Remind me again how the nice thing with Apple gear is that it "just
works"...</p>
