<a href="/2016/07/06/virgin_east_coast_6.html">my previous reply to them</a> I got a
reply back yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr Pearson</p>
<p>Many thanks for your email dated 6th July 2016 regarding the fact that you
cannot sign into your Virgin Trains ticket wallet app after registering on
the desktop version of our website with the email address
davep.org+virgin@gmail.com.</p>
<p>I firstly apologise for the lack of understanding on the part of our
Virgin Trains East Coast Web Support team with regards to this, the Mobile
ticket issue on our app that you have described is one that has not
occurred very frequently at all for any of our customers and as such this
is what is causing the difficulty in resolving this for you.</p>
<p>I have today spoken to our second line support team and asked them the
question of if there is soon to be a fix for this for you to which they
have stated that they need a few more days to get this fixed.</p>
<p>I will schedule in a contact back for you for Monday 11th July and after
chasing them about this again I will contact you to let you know what is
happening with this now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it's taken quite a while, it looks like I'm finally making some
progress. If I'm reading it right they finally acknowledge that there is a
problem and that it needs fixing. It's frustrating that I've had to go
backwards and forwards a few times to get to this point.</p>
<p>Monday will be interesting.</p>
