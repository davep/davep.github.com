<a href="/2016/09/02/virgin_east_coast_13.html">about 3 weeks since my last post about my exploits in getting a problem solved with Virgin East Coast</a>
so now's a good time for a little update.</p>
<p>Two things were "outstanding" the last time I wrote about this. One was that
Mike (the customer relations manager in
<a href="https://twitter.com/davidhorne">the Virgin East Coast MD</a>'s office) wanted
us to meet up for a coffee and a chat about my issues and how things were
progressing, etc. Sadly I wasn't able to make the original date we'd picked
out as a possible so another date was arranged. At least, it was kind of
arranged. It was noted that this week might be a good time to meet and I'd
written back to him to say that Wednesday 21st would be good. Since then
I've had no reply at all.</p>
<p>The second thing that is outstanding is having someone call me about the
issues with the Ticket Wallet app. I've yet to receive a call from the
person who originally phoned me and who I missed (and who I chased up every
day for a week afterwards). I was then told by Mike, about 2 weeks or so
back, that that person's manager would call me instead and that I should
expect a call early last week.</p>
<p>That call didn't happen. Didn't happen early last week, late last week, at
all last week. It's now Thursday this week and I've still not had a call.</p>
<p>Just this morning I've chased up both of the above.</p>
<p>It's
<a href="/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html">now over 3 months since I first reported the Ticket Wallet app problem</a>
and I seem to be no closer to seeing it resolved, or even having an
explanation as to the cause of the problem.</p>
