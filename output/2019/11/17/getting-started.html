</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>By coincidence, in a couple of different places over the last couple of
weeks, the subject of <em>"how do I progress in leaning to program?"</em> has
cropped up. For me, I think the approaches and solutions tend to be the same
for when I want to get my head around a new language: read good examples of
idiomatic code, read other related materials, find a problem you care about
and implement a solution (ideally something you'll directly benefit from, or
at least others may benefit from). Hence the <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">5x5 puzzle and Norton Guide
reader projects I mentioned in my previous
post</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has problems that they need solving in a way that
would work for this approach. So another approach I've recommended in the
past is to go looking on somewhere like GitHub and find projects that
promote "low-hanging fruit" issues in a way that's designed to be friendly
for those who are new to development, new to contributing or new to the
problem domain.</p>
<p>While looking for examples of this yesterday I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners"><em>Awesome for
Beginners</em></a>. This looks
like a great list and one I'm going to keep <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:davep/">bookmarked for future
reference</a>. Now, this particular list does
seem to have an emphasis on <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/issues/215">pulling in people who are new to contributing
to a project</a>
rather than new to development, but it does strike me as a good place to
start looking no matter where you're coming from.</p>
<p>I know I'm going to start having a wander around that list. It's always nice
to contribute and I feel there's real personal benefit in actively solving a
problem that someone else has and welcomes help with.</p>
