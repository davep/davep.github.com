</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As detailed in a blog post I wrote <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">back in
2016</a>, I first got into
using Emacs in the mid 1990s, starting with it on OS/2 and then moving over
to GNU/Linux. It's been my often-used and much-loved development environment
for most of those years (I even have a couple of packages that are part of
Emacs itself).</p>
<p>For most of that time my configuration was a single <code>~/.emacs</code> file, which
was around 1,000 lines in length (including comments and whitespace). It'd
grown over the years, having special configuration sections for versions of
Emacs I didn't use any more, and operating systems I didn't work on any more
(yes, really, there were things in there specific to MS-DOS, for example).
On top of that I always hand-installed packages I used -- Emacs' package
management system having turned up long after I first got into using Emacs.</p>
<p>Then, in early 2016, I decided to nuke the whole thing and start from
scratch. As mentioned above, the start of this <a href="/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html">is detailed in an older
post</a>. Another big round of
changes <a href="/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html">happened round a year
later</a> -- which included
the birth of <a href="http://blog.davep.org/delpa/">delpa</a> to manage my personal
packages. A couple or so months later there was <a href="/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html">one last big round of
changes</a>, mostly killing
off my enthusiastic embracing of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization"><code>customize</code></a>
and instead going back to hand-set settings, only this time done via
<a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package"><code>use-package</code></a>.</p>
<p>The full history of this <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d">can be found over on
GitHub</a>, starting with the first "throw
everything away and start again" process and all the steps between then and
where my Emacs configuration is now.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the fun part of this blog post. Earlier this week I
stumbled on <a href="https://gource.io/">Gource</a>. It's a tool that's primarily
designed to visualise changes in repositories, although it can be used to
visualise anything that has a tree structure and changes over time (this
week I produced a video of the growth of my employer's electronic lab
notebook by hooking up the <a href="https://www.benchling.com/">Benchling</a> API with
Gource, for example). So I got curious. What did it look like as I reworked
and tweaked and changed and tinkered with my Emacs configuration?</p>
<p>This is what it looked like:</p>
