</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's hardly a revelation to say that learning a new programming language, or
even learning software development at all, is even more difficult if you
don't have an actual problem to solve. I know I'm not alone in having pet
projects that, when faced with a new environment, I'll code up a version of
that project as a way to get familiar with and understand a language's
idioms while implementing something I know well.</p>
<p>Personally, my two favourites are a puzzle called 5x5
(<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.xml">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/Chrome-5x5">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-for-Chrome">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-Palm">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5.el">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/5x5-react">here</a> and
<a href="http://davep.org/misc/5x5/">here</a>), and writing a library or even a full
application to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides">Norton Guide database
files</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2html">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/w3ng">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg-OS2">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg1013">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/weg">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davep/eg">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davep/eg.el">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/jsNG">here</a>). Both are fun to work on, have
practical uses, and both have the benefit of being solved problems (for me)
that let me concentrate on the "how do I do <em>X</em> in this
language/toolkit/environment/framework/etc?".</p>
<p>Even with those two as my goto projects, I'm always open to new small
problems that might be fun to apply to languages I do know, or languages I
want to get to know (internally at work <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1123952281156751361">we have a fun "league" of sorts,
writing a particular hamming distance calculation tool in different
languages</a>, for
example).</p>
<p>A few days ago, via <a href="https://github.com/Lethrir/Journeys">this repo on
GitHub</a>, I discovered <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys">this fun little
problem</a>. Right away I could see the
benefit in it. As a "go away and code up a solution" interview question it
strikes me as near-perfect. It's obviously not hard to solve, but it touches
on some basic but important aspects of software development and so will
allow the developer to show off how they approach things.</p>
<p>There's so many different approaches to it too. Even in a single language, I
could imagine having some fun writing the smallest code to solve the
problem, the most idiomatic code to solve the problem, the most supportable
and well-documented code to solve the problem, etc. And then there's the
thing I talk about above: knowing the solution and knowing it's easy, you
can then use it to learn the idiomatic way of solving the problem in new
languages.</p>
<p>Even better, <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys#other-solutions">the README of the original repo links to solutions others have
written</a>. Knowing
the problem, and knowing the solution, you can then go and read other
people's code and learn something about different styles and different
languages.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, as I get free time, I think I might just do this.
Take the "Journeys" problem and write versions in different languages I work
with, or know, and also use it to get to know languages I've yet to know or
use heavily (I'm especially keen to try a version in
<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> -- a language I really like the look of and
want to find a reason to use).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, yesterday, I had a quick go at a first version in Python (aimed
at Python 3.8 or higher):
<a href="https://github.com/davep/journeys.py">https://github.com/davep/journeys.py</a></p>
<p>I set out to try and write something that was fairly idiomatic Python, which
uses tools that I tend to employ when working on Python projects (pipenv,
make, etc), and which also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">used something I've never quite found a need for
so far</a> in my usual
coding, but which I can see being useful and helpful.</p>
<p>I even threw in a couple of uses of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/">PEP
572</a>!</p>
<p>I can see me tinkering with this some more over the next few days. I can
even see me writing a very different implementation in Python, just for the
fun of it.</p>
<p>I think that's what I like about this little problem. It's a good way to do
a bit of programming exercise; it's like the perfect way to do the
programming equivalent of going for a short run.</p>
