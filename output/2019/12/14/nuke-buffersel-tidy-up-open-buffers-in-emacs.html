</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Both at work and at home I use Emacs by <a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el">keeping a copy running all the
time</a>, and use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server"><code>emacsclient</code> to open
files inside
it</a>
(including on remote machines thanks to a bit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><code>ssh</code></a> and heavy use of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/"><code>tramp</code></a> -- I might write this up at
some point). This works really well, but does mean I tend to build up a lot
of buffers over time.</p>
<p>Having lots of buffers open isn't generally an issue, and if I'm working on
lots of different files in a project during the course of a hacking session
it's actually a good thing. But, quite often, I want to tidy up the buffer
list, clearing it back to near-zero buffers open. Many years ago, when I had
a "proper" tower system running 24/7, with Emacs open all the time, I'd use
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MidnightMode"><code>clean-buffer-list</code> as part of
<code>midnight</code></a>. Along the way
that fell out of favour with me, likely because I drifted into using
machines that had Emacs open all the time but where the machine wasn't awake
all the time.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to have some fun rolling my own solution, and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el"><code>nuke-buffers</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>Rather than try and do things in an automated way, this was designed to be
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/ffc863ca0fb669d2f6639bda62e81764c35767ce/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L98-L107">bound to a key (or
two)</a>
and then be run when I wanted, being as harsh as possible about cleaning up
the buffer list. Since first writing it it's worked well for me.</p>
<p>These days I tend to let the buffer list build up as I work on a new
feature, or chase down a bug, etc. Then, once I've made the final commit for
that period of focus, I'll hit the <code>nuke-buffer</code> key combo as the final act
of confirming that I've done the job. So not only does this help tidy my
Emacs session a bit, it also feels like a physical form of punctuation --
back in less sensible days, when I had some terrible habits, it would have
been when I'd reach for the celebratory cigarette; buffer-tidying feels far
more wholesome. ;)</p>
<p>The way the code works is, of course, mostly directed at how I work -- it's
highly likely it wouldn't make sense for many other people. The main aim is
to kill as many buffers as possible, but without disturbing anything else.
The list of buffers it gathers for nuking avoids buffers that are <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L60-L62">visiting
files but have unsaved
content</a>,
avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L54">the
minibuffer</a>
(obviously), avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L56">any "special"
buffer</a>
(one that starts with a space then an asterisk), avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L73">the current
buffer</a>
and also avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L58">any buffer in a list of names to
avoid</a>.</p>
<p>I've being using this on a daily basis for around 2.5 years now and it's
done the job without ever losing me any work.</p>
