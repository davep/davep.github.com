                <p>Something I always try to do when I'm coding is be consistent. I feel this
is important. While people's coding standards may differ, I think different
approaches are easier to handle if someone has been consistent with their
style across all of their code.</p>
<p>This also stands for documentation too.</p>
<p>In my current position, I do a <em>lot</em> of Python coding, and one of the things
I like about Python (there are things I don't like too, but that's not for
now) is that it has doc-strings (just like my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">favourite
language</a>). I use them
extensively, ensuring every function and method has some form of
documentation, and generally I use
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> to generate documentation
from those doc-strings.</p>
<p>Early on I was bothered by the fact that, just by the simple act of making
typos, I wasn't keeping the form of the doc-strings consistent. And in this
case it was a <em>really</em> simple thing that was bugging me. Normally, if I'm
writing a single-line doc-string, I'll write like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">one_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is a one-line doc-string.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far, so good. But, if the doc-string is a multi-liner, I prefer the
ending quotes to be on a line of their own, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But, sometimes, by accident, I'd leave a doc-string like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multi_liner</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is the first line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is another line.</span>
<span class="sd">    Here is the final line.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While it's really not a big deal, it would bug me and every time I found one
like this I'd "fix" it.</p>
<p>Eventually, it bugged me enough that I decided I was going to write a little
tool to find all such instances in my code and report them. My first
approach was to think "I could just do this with some regexp magic", <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">which
was really a bad idea</a>. Then I
though, I know, I should use this as an excuse to to play with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">Python's ast
library</a>.</p>
<p>That worked really well! I had <a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck/blob/dc5052002690b1f898ccd68f815cdedbe9172b74/pydscheck">the first version of the
code</a>
up and running in no time. It was simple but did the job. It ran through
Python code I threw at it and alerted me to both missing doc-strings, and
doc-strings with the ending I didn't like.</p>
<p>That served me for a while, until one day I realised that it wasn't quite
doing the job correctly; it was only really looking at top-level functions
and top-level methods in classes. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, I'll
define functions within functions, and I feel they deserve documentation
too. So then I modified the code to ensure it walked every part of the AST.</p>
<p>Since then, when I've run into new things and had new ideas, <code>pydscheck</code> has
grown and grown. I've added checks that all mentioned parameters have a
type; I've added checks that any function/method that returns something
actually documents the return value; I've added checks that any
documentation of a returned value includes its type; I've added checks that
any function or method that yields a value documents that fact; I've added
checks that ensure that every parameter is documented in some way.</p>
<p>Each time I've done this it's helped uncover issues in my code's
documentation that could be cleaner, and it's also given me a pet project to
slowly better understand Python's AST.</p>
<p>It could be that there are better tools out there, I'd have thought that a
good doc-string linting tool would be something someone had already written.
But this time around I was happy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> it because I needed a
fun learning exercise that would also have some benefits for my day-to-day
work.</p>
<p>I'll caveat this with the fact that it's very particular to how I work and
how I like my documentation to look, but if it sounds useful, here it is:
<a href="https://github.com/davep/pydscheck">https://github.com/davep/pydscheck</a>.</p>
<p>There's still lots I could do with it. First off I should really properly
package it up so it can be installed as a command line tool via pip. Other
things that would be handy would be to allow some form of customisation of
how it works. I'm sure there's other fun things I can do with it too.</p>
<p>That's part of the fun of having a pet project: you can tinker when you like
and also get benefits from it as you use it.</p>
