                <h1>An update</h1>
<p>So, it's fast approaching 2 months now <a href="/2022/10/05/on-to-something-new-redux.html">since I started the new
thing</a> and it's been a busy
time. I've had to adjust to a quite a few new things, not least of which has
been a longer and more involved commute. I'm actually mostly enjoying it
too. While having to contend with busses isn't the <em>best</em> thing to be doing
with my day, I do have a very fond spot for Edinburgh and it's nice to be in
there most days of the week.</p>
<p>Part of the fallout from the new job has been that, in the last couple of
weeks, I've thrown some more stuff up on PyPi. This comes about as part of a
bit of a dog-fooding campaign we're on at the moment (you can read some
background to this <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/">over on the company
blog</a>).
While they have been, and will continue to be, mentioned on the Textualize
blog, I thought I'd give a brief mention of them here on my own blog too
given they are, essentially, personal projects.</p>
<h1>gridinfo</h1>
<p>This is one I'd like to tweak some more and improve on if possible. It is,
in essence, a Python-coded terminal tool that does more or less the same as
<a href="https://github.com/davep/slstats.el"><code>slstats.el</code></a>. It started out as <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1590476280457490434">a
rather silly quick
hack</a>, designed
to do something different with
<a href="https://github.com/darrenburns/rich-pixels"><code>rich-pixels</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here's the finished version (as of the time of writing) being put through
its paces:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gridinfo/">from here</a>, or install and
play with it with a quick <code>pipx install gridinfo</code>.</p>
<h1>unbored</h1>
<p>The next experiment with Textual was to write a terminal-based client for
the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">Bored-API</a>. My initial plan for this was to
just have a button or two that the user could mash on and they'd get an
activity suggestion dropped into the middle of the terminal; but really that
seemed a bit boring. Then I realised that it'd be a bit more silly and a bit
more fun if I did it as a sort of TODO app. Bored? Run it up and use one of
the activities you'd generated before. Don't like any of them? Ignore them
and generate some more! Feeling bad that you've got such a backlog of
reasons to not be bored? Delete a bunch!</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Here's a short video of it in action:</p>

</div>

<p>Download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/unbored/">from here</a>, or install and play
with it with a quick <code>pipx install unbored</code>.</p>
<h1>textual-qrcode</h1>
<p>This one... this one I'm going to blame on the brain fog that followed flu
<em>and</em> Covid jabs that happened the day before (and which are still kicking
my arse 4 days later). Monday morning, at my desk, and I'm wondering what to
next write to experiment with Textual, and I realised it would be
interesting to write something that would show off that it's easy to make a
third party widget library.</p>
<p>And... yeah, I don't know why, but I remembered
<a href="https://github.com/davep/qrencode.el"><code>qrencode.el</code></a> and so
<code>textual-qrcode</code> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="The most useless Textal widget yet" src="/attachments/2022/12/01/textual-qrcode.png"></p>
<p>I think the most amusing part about this is that I did it in full knowledge
that it would be useless; the idea being it would be a daft way of showing
off how you could build a widget library as an add-on for Textual. But...
more than one person actually ended up saying "yeah hold up there this could
actually be handy!"</p>
<p>If you're one of those people... <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual-qrcode/">you'll find it
here</a>.</p>
<h1>FivePyFive</h1>
<p>While I was on a roll putting stuff up on PyPi, I also decided to tweak up
my Textual-based 5x5 and throw that up too. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/davepdotorg/status/1554207518615814148">my first app built
with Textual</a>,
initially written before I'd even spoken to Will about the position here. At
one point I even did <a href="https://github.com/davep/textual/blob/c4f60548922609133763c0e49f7b23aea5d44c2b/sandbox/davep/five_by_five.hy">a version in
Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>It's since gone on to become <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/tree/d2ba22b86f48f4ce5b0f55767efdcf1a5478b180/examples">one of the example apps in Textual
itself</a>
but I felt it deserved being made available to the world via an easy(ish)
install. So, if you fancy trying to crack the puzzle in your terminal, just
do a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>fivepyfive
</code></pre></div>

<p>and click away.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="343" height="610"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf34Z5r7Q60" title="FivePyFive -- A
little annoying puzzle for the terminal" frameborder="0"
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fivepyfive/">over here</a>.</p>
<h1>PISpy</h1>
<p>Finally... for this week anyway, is a tool I've called PISpy. It's designed
as a simple terminal client for looking up package information on PyPi. As
of right now it's pretty straightforward, but I'd like to add more to it
over time. Here's an example of it in action:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMGD6bXqIEo" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>One small wrinkle with publishing it to PyPi was the fact that, once I'd
chosen the name, I checked that it hadn't been used on PyPi (it hadn't) but
when it came to publishing the package it got rejected because the name was
too similar to another package! I don't know which, it wouldn't say, but
that was a problem. So in the end the published name ended up having to be
slightly different from the actual tool's name.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/">over here</a> for the package, and
you can install it with a:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pispy-client
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then just run <code>pispy</code> in the terminal.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's been a fun couple of weeks coming up with stuff to help exercise
Textual, and there's more to come. Personally I've found the process really
helpful in that it's help me learn more about the framework and also figure
out my own approach to working with it. Each thing I've built so far has
been a small step in evolution on from what I did in the previous thing. I
doubt I've arrived at a plateau of understanding just yet.</p>
