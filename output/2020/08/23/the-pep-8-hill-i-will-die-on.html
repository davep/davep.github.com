  <div>
    <p>I first learnt Python back in the mid-to-late 90s, used it in place of Perl
once I was comfortable with it, and then we sort of drifted apart when I
first met Ruby. It's only in the last couple of years that I've got back
into it, and in a huge way, thanks to <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">my (not-quite-so-) new
job</a>. Despite
the quirks and oddness (as I perceive them), I actually quite like Python
and it's one of those languages that just flows off my fingers. I'm sure you
know the same thing, perhaps not with Python, but there will be languages
that just flow for you, and those that take a bit more effort and
concentration. Python... feels okay to me.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that there's been a long-standing style guide. I quite
like <a href="python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> as a read, and think there's a
lot of good ideas in there; much of the content sits with how I'd approach
things if I was tasked to come up with such a document. With this in mind,
I'm a fairly heavy user of <code>pylint</code> and it in turn leans on PEP 8 (amongst
other things) and I'm happy to accept most of its judgements. Not all of its
judgements, <a href="/2019/11/04/my-pylint-shame.html">but even when I disagree with it I try and keep track of how
far I'm
drifting</a>.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely one hill I will happily die on when it comes to PEP
8: the concept of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements">"extraneous whitespace" in lists and
expressions</a>.
Just.... no! Oh gods no!</p>
<p>To borrow a line of code from <a href="/2019/11/10/going-on-a-journey.html">the journey problem I dabbled with a while
back</a>,
PEP 8 would have me write something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">commands</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">state</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, I'm sure plenty of people won't see a problem with this at all; but all
I can see is an almost-claustrophobic parameter list. What's with the
parameters being jammed up against the opening and closing parens? Why have
the dinky little comma lost between two different things? Why have it look
like a long stream of letters and punctuation? Why....</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just no.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly, I just need for the code to breathe a bit. When I type
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">commands</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="nb">str</span> <span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">State</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">State</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>suddenly if feels like there's fresh air in the code, like it flows gently
out of my head, off my fingers, through the keyboard and into the buffer.</p>
<p>In my head, and to my eyes, the code is.... relaxed.</p>
<p>Do I have a rational reason for this? Nope. Then again I don't see one for
doing it the other way either; I can't think of one and I don't see one in
the source document. So, that's a warning I always turn off with <code>pylint</code>
and it's a style I carry through all my Python code; and I think that's the
important point here: anyone reading and working with my code should see the
same style all the way through. It might differ from PEP 8 on this point,
but at least it's the same all the way.</p>
<p>And, really, that's okay: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds">PEP 8 is there to be
ignored</a>.
;-)</p>
<p>PS: This is a small part of another blog post I was meaning to write, and
might still do, about my (still ongoing) experience of getting
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode"><code>lsp-mode</code></a> up and running in Emacs
and having it play nice with Python projects. I have that working, but it
was a bit of a learning curve and epic battle over a couple of days, and one
that had me first encounter
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/"><code>pycodestyle</code></a>. I may still tell the
tale...</p>
