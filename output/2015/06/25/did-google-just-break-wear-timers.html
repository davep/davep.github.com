</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I didn't pay too much attention to it when it happened but it looks like
Android Wear, on the phone side, got an update in the last 24 hours. Only
this evening did I notice that this seems to have broken something I heavily
use on my watch: timers.</p>
<p>I find the timer facility on Wear especially useful when I'm cooking, either
to ensure that different parts of the cooking process come together at a
sensible time, or when I put something on and need to go off and do something
else (perhaps come back to the office while and get on with some work as
something bakes, etc).</p>
<p>To be clear, the timer app is still there and, if I select to start a timer
"by hand" on the watch, it works as it always has done. Also, if I say
"OK Google, set a timer for five minutes" it still does the voice recognition
thing:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Android Wear Screenshot.png"></p>
<p>It's what happens next that's the problem. Before it would have started a
countdown timer. As well as vibrating the watch when the timer runs down the
timer app also has the very useful feature of showing the countdown on the watch
face. This means you can glance every so often and see how long is left to go.</p>
<p>Instead, as of today (well, this evening when I made dinner was when I first
noticed it), it starts an on-watch alarm app instead! This is utterly useless.
Sure, it does still vibrate the watch when the alarm time arrives, and the
alarm time is the right offset from when the timer was requested, but it
lacks the on-face countdown.</p>
<p>It's an alarm.</p>
<p>It's not a timer!</p>
<p>Looking in the Wear app it would appear that the correct application is
assigned to the correct action:</p>
<p><img alt="Google still understands the request" src="/attachments/2015/06/25/Screenshot_2015-06-25-22-22-03.png"></p>
<p>As such, I'm at a loss on how to fix this. I can't find anything on the watch
itself that could be done to change this, and I've tried restarting the
watch on the off chance that something went a bit odd.</p>
<p>It turns out too that I'm not alone. I
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3b3cu8/i_cant_set_a_timer_via_voice/">found a thread on reddit where others have the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>What really bugs me about this is that this is very Google. I've run into this
sort of thing so many times before, be it on Android, ChromeOS or in their
apps in general. They'll change (or screw up) something that's very simple and
straightforward and in common use, something that <em>should</em> show up in
testing pretty easily. Surely there has to be some way of pushing out an update
without screwing up the apps that are assigned to actions?</p>
<p>As much as I really like what Google offer, as much as I value their services
and global platform over the other choices, this sort of thing frustrates the
hell out of me.</p>
