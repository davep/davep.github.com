</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>For a long time now Chrome has been my web browser of choice. It has, to some
degree, become my "other emacs" (ignoring for a moment that my use of GNU
emacs has sort of lapsed the last few years). By that I mean that it's a
portable environment that serves me well on many operating systems and, for
one of my machines, actually <em>is</em> the operating system. I really appreciate how
Chrome's sync lets me feel right at home no matter which machine I'm on.</p>
<p>But I've run into one small issue that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>In some situations I find it pleasing, and I find it makes sense, that some
web "apps" open in a window of their own rather than in a Chrome tab. On Windows
and on ChromeOS this is simple enough, all I need to do is find the "app" in
the Chrome app launcher, pull up the content menu, and tell it to open as a
window.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on Windows 7" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextWin.png"></p>
<p>Nice and simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac, so well known for doing everything every other OS does but doing
it better and being easier to use.... you'd expect it's at least the same there,
right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><img alt="Chrome app context menu on OS X" src="/attachments/2015/06/18/GmailContextMac.png"></p>
<p>There's no option at all to open as a window!</p>
<p>So, on the Mac, while I'd love to be able to open Gmail as a window/app in its
own right, I'm totally out of luck, it seems. I've no idea whose "fault" this
is. It's not clear to me if this is a Chrome/Google decision or if it's about
how things have to work on a Mac. Thing is, I find it hard to believe that
it's the latter given that Google Keep runs in its own window on the Mac and
I can happily pin it to the dock.</p>

<p>It's that simple on ChromeOS too. In case you're wondering why I didn't
also illustrate that, it's because you can't take a screenshot on ChromeOS
while you've got a context menu open. O_o&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
