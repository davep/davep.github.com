</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on <a href="/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html">my iMac</a>.</p>
<p>One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:</p>
<p><img alt="Support details of the iMac" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.14.png"></p>
<p>Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.29.23.png"></p>
<p>Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o</p>
<p>I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:</p>
<p><img alt="Seems I read Spanish" src="/attachments/2015/09/10/Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 14.30.55.png"></p>
<p>About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.</p>
<p>So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.</p>
