</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Earlier on today I needed a copy of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"><code>wget</code></a> on my iMac. It's not "native" to
it so I got to wondering how you go about getting something like that onto it.
Sure, I could have just grabbed the source and built myself, but really it's
a lot nicer to use some sort of package manager.</p>
<p>A quick search lead me to <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and I was then up and
running in no time.</p>
<p>This in turn got me to thinking about how it might be fun to get some of the
software I used to use on my GNU/Linux machine up and running again. The first
one that came to mind was <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/"><code>slrn</code></a>. Sure enough
slrn is available via Homebrew and installing it was dead simple.</p>
<p>But then I was faced with a problem: I needed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">NNTP</a> server.
Way back I used to run a local one in my office that fed from and to my
ISP's. Back then my ISP was Demon Internet; these days I'm with BT. A quick
search lead me to an article or two that BT had a NNTP server, of sorts,
provided by a third party. So I did a quick check:</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.27.43.png"></p>
<p>Yay! This looked good.</p>
<p>After that I fired up <code>slrn</code> and.... problems. It kept asking me to log in,
to provide a user name and password. The only problem was that I'd read in more
than one place that a user name and password weren't needed for BT's server;
all that was required was you be on a BT IP address. Checking the slrn docs
I found <a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-manual-6.html#ss6.32"><code>force_authentication</code></a>
but ensuring that was off made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point I removed <code>slrn</code> and gave up.</p>
<p>Later, thinking it might be an issue with just <code>slrn</code> and perhaps it was worth
trying a native NNTP client, I grabbed Unison
(<a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">which is no longer supported</a>
but seems to work fine). I got that set up and ran into the same issue: it
wanted login details.</p>
<p>Finally, after a bit more digging, I stumbled on the reason why I was struggling
to make any of this work: <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51205/?s_cid=con_FURL_giganews">BT had closed support for the server back in
December last year</a>!</p>
<p>A quick search around the web and I stumbled on <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org/">Eternal September</a>.
Given all I was interested in was the good old text groups this looked perfect.
I quickly registered an account, ran up Unison again and plugged in my details
and....</p>
<p><img alt="Is the server there?" src="/attachments/2015/11/13/Screen Shot 2015-11-13 at 15.19.17.png"></p>
<p>Now that's all sorted I should try again with <code>slrn</code>. At which point I'll need
to drag out and tidy up <code>post.el</code> (<a href="http://post-mode.sourceforge.net/">the version that was being maintained
by some other people seems to have gone very stale</a>, sadly).</p><p>There are <a href="/2015/11/13/a-little-bit-of-usenet.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
