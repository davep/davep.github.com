</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For well over a year now I've been recording my VR gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg">and uploading
it to YouTube</a>. Less as a "content
creation" thing, more as a nice record of games I've played and, on
occasion, as a little bit of help to others; in the past I've watched other
folk play games I like to get ideas for approaches to them, and I've also
received the odd comment now and again where my play-through has helped
someone else.</p>
<p>A question I've had a couple of times is what I use to do the recording, so
I thought I'd make an effort to write it all down here.</p>
<p>First up, a couple of things to note: I started recording PCVR around April
2021 and the initial setup was a bit trial-and-error and Google searching
and blog reading. As such, not all of the details of <em>how</em> to set up will be
here, and I may even miss off some stuff I changed and is worthy of note; at
the same time I might mention stuff that's just an obvious default.</p>
<p>Consider this blog post as being a written version of one of my videos: it's
for my own fun and benefit and might also help me in the future should I
want to apply some of this again, and if it helps someone else that's a
lovely bonus.</p>
<h1>The Hardware</h1>
<p>While it's not exactly the point of this post, I guess it's worth mentioning
the hardware I use as of the time of writing. Given this is about PCVR, I of
course have a PC which is running Windows. The machine information within
Windows says it's a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warning: I don't do hardware. I buy it from time to time, but hardware
leaves me bored. It runs VR on a PC. This is fine.</p>
<p>The machine itself has 16 GB of memory, is running Windows 10 Home and has a
GeForce RTX 3060 for handling the graphics.</p>
<p>The headset I'm using is a~~n Oculus~~ Meta Quest 2. I've had this
since around November 2020, playing Quest-native games for the first few
months, until I cracked and got the PC mentioned here to get into PCVR.</p>
<p>The headset is connected to the PC with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08MJDNV4F/">a USB
cable</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, for recording voice, I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08T1S7NRP/?th=1">USB lapel microphone with a really
long cable</a>.</p>
<p>It should be said that, yes, sometimes, I do get a little caught up in
things with two cables hanging off me. If I could give one tip here it would
be that running the microphone cable up your trousers and shirt makes life a
ton easier. As a bonus I have the USB cable for the headset running around
the headset's strap and connected to it at the back and then running down my
back.</p>
<h1>OBS Studio</h1>
<p>The core software used is <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>. This has
got to be one of the best bits of free software I've ever used, in terms of
interface and what it delivers.</p>
<p>Years back my son used to record and upload gameplay to YouTube and I can
remember him having no end of issues using different recording software;
some working with one game but not another, some other working with a
different set of games, video and sync issues, etc... Lots of pain quite
often. With OBS Studio the only issues I've ever had have been my own
mistakes.</p>
<p>At this point I have to confess that when I set it up I didn't make a point
of keeping a recording of what I changed -- I was experimenting and not
expecting much to come of it. So what I note here are the things that feel
like they're important, and only the things that relate to recording PCVR,
not streaming it (that might end up being a different blog post).</p>
<p>That said, here are things I seem to remember as being key:</p>
<h2>Output Settings</h2>
<p>The items in the output pane in settings that I have and which might be
important are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Output Mode:</code> Simple</li>
<li><code>Recording Quality</code>: High Quality, Medium File Size</li>
<li><code>Recording format</code>: mkv</li>
<li><code>Encoder</code>: Hardware (NVENC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do remember the recording format being set to <code>mkv</code> as something that's
really important. I think it's <code>mp4</code> by default, or was when I first
installed, and if your machine crashes or OBS were to crash or something,
you could end up with footage that can't be used. Using <code>mkv</code> means you can
still use the footage (as I understand it). It does mean that once you're
finished you have to use the "remux" option under the <code>File</code> menu, but
that's a small price to pay.</p>
<p>I can say that at least once I've had to hard-reboot my machine when a game
and SteamVR and the like all got upset. I likely saved 45 minutes or more of
footage thanks to <code>mkv</code>.</p>
<h1>Video Settings</h1>
<p>Nothing really special in here, I simply have both the base and output
resolutions set to the desktop resolution. This <em>might</em> be something for me
to tinker with in the future, but so far I've not run into any problems.</p>
<h1>VR Capture</h1>
<p>Now, of course, all of the above is great and fine and all but there's the
issue of how you capture the VR gameplay. I approach this a couple of
different ways. The first is I use the <a href="https://github.com/baffler/OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin">OpenVR Capture plugin for
OBS</a>. This makes
capturing footage from SteamVR really easy. The only downside I found is
that out of the box there's no default crop setting for using a Quest 2 (or
I guess the Rift, as the Quest 2 sort of appears as a Rift to SteamVR
games). As such I remember playing trial and error with that until I was
happy I was getting as much footage as possible without having black bars
and the like.</p>
<p>Something I also like about the OpenVR Capture plugin is you can say if you
want to capture the left or right eye. Normally not that big a deal for some
things, but if you're playing a shooter and want people to see exactly what
your dominant eye is seeing, that matters.</p>
<p>Sadly, of course, not every game can be captured with that plugin. So far
I've found that any game that can't be has its own mirror window on the
desktop. In that case I use a <code>Game Capture</code> source and set it to capture
that specific window. I could of course just get it to capture the focused
window or something like that but I prefer to know that it's only grabbing
what I want it to grab.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>That's pretty much it I think. There's not a lot to it, although on occasion
a lot can go wrong. Mostly it's a wonder any of it works. I mean, think
about it, I have a computer with two screens strapped to my face, with two
controllers in my hands talking to it; it's then connected via the Oculus
Link to the Oculus Home; from which I start up SteamVR; and from the SteamVR
home I start up the game and then "live" inside the game. It's a virtual
world inside a virtual world inside a virtual world inside a real world;
with lots of software along the way, all talking at once.</p>
<p>That is then being recorded.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on occasion, it takes a reboot or five to make it all work
together.</p>
<p>Really, it's a wonder it ever works. ;-)</p><p>There are <a href="/2022/05/28/my-vr-recording-setup.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
