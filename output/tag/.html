</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>It's well over a year since I last wrote something on this blog. As
mentioned in the last post (and the one before), it's not for bad reasons or
anything like that. Being in a new job, which actually isn't all that new
now, has kept me busy in all the best ways possible.</p>
<p>There's been other stuff going on too which has drawn on my attention and
the time and motivation to blog, either random stuff, or more
development-related stuff, just hasn't been there.</p>
<p>Also... blogging via GitHub, using Jekyll, has lost a lot of its shine. It
sort of makes sense, well, sort of <em>made</em> sense, but in the end it felt like
more work than it should. Whereas most blogging systems tend to encourage
just diving in and banging on the keyboard, there's just a bit more faff
with the GitHub pages approach.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, and with no desire right now to roll my own (which
would be fun, it has to be said), I'm going to <a href="https://blog.davep.dev/">skip off over to Hashnode's
blogging system</a>. It seems to have everything I'd
want and I can slap it on a domain of mine.</p>
<p>Most of my random musings about random things really happen on Twitter, so I
can't imagine I'll be wanting to blog about normal/mundane things. What I
would like to do is write about development-related things from time to
time. So that would seem to fit even better.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of all this waffle. If you land here and it looks kind of
quiet, that's because it has been quiet for a while and I'm now going to try
and concentrate elsewhere, with a wish to do some coding-related writing now
and again.</p><p>There are <a href="/2019/10/18/time-to-move-on.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
