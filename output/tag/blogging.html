couple of days back</a> I've been thinking some
more about moving away from Jekyll. Jekyll itself has served me well since I
started this blog <a href="/2015/06/18/hello-world.html">back in 2015</a>, but I was
reminded again when installing it on the Mac Mini that it's Ruby-based and I
have very little understanding of how to get a good Ruby experience on
macOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/110643256889173912">mentioned on Mastodon that I was thinking about finally looking at
moving my blog management/generation to something
new</a>, and specifically
something Python-based and ideally some sort of site generator, I got a few
suggestions.</p>
<p>One that looks promising so far is <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. At
first glance it seems to tick a few boxes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-based (so easy for me to grok in terms of installing, and also more
  chance of being hackable).</li>
<li>Uses Markdown (curiously as an alternative, to reStructuredText, which
  looks to be the default).</li>
<li>Does article-based stuff as well as page-based stuff.</li>
<li>Lots of themes, and themes are Jinja2-based (I'm pretty familiar with
  Jinja thanks to my Django days and also <a href="https://github.com/davep/ng2web">using the library when kicking
  off <code>ng2web</code></a>).</li>
<li>RSS feed generation.</li>
<li>Syntax-highlighted code blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm not quite ready to dive in and make the move just yet (I am on a
"muck about at home" holiday this week, but I've got enough planned without
losing a day to rebooting my blog), I did do a quick experiment to see if
Pelican would work for me.</p>
<p>Key to this is can I keep the URLs for all the posts the same? If I can't
that's a non-starter.</p>
<p>Things got off to a good start with an easy install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pipx<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;pelican[markdown]&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then used the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to kick off a test site, copied in my
existing Markdown files, dived into the docs and found how to configure the
generated URLs and... yeah, within like 10 minutes I had a <em>very</em> rough
version of my blog up and going.</p>
<p>It looked like garbage, the theme really wasn't to my taste at all, but the
core of the blog was working.</p>
<p>I've nuked it all for now but a more considered evaluation is now on my TODO
list. Things I'll need to drive into properly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a base theme that's to my taste.</li>
<li>Get Disqus working it so that any old comments remain in place.</li>
<li>Get my image/attachment layout back in place.</li>
<li>Go through and tidy up all the tagging (which has been a mess with this
  blog because I never did get round to getting Jekyll to actually use
  tags).</li>
<li>Figure out the best way to do the publishing to GitHub pages.</li>
<li>Likely a bunch of other stuff I've not thought about yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, yeah, for a brief "over first coffee of the day" tinker to see if I
like it... I like!</p>
<p>Let's see how long it takes me to actually get around to making the switch.
;-)</p>

<p>When setting this up a couple of days back, I had to pin some packages
for the blog to older versions because of Ruby version issues; I'm sure
that Ruby has virtual environment solutions akin to Python, but diving
into that just for one tool... nah.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
