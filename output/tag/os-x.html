</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Last night, before heading for bed, I noticed that there was an update available
for OS X on the iMac, and also for iTunes. Despite the late hour I decided
to do the update anyway. OS X updated pretty smoothly (albeit with some rather
unhelpful progress bars that appear to give estimated times that have no
relation to reality), as did iTunes.</p>
<p>I was then told that there was an update for my iPod as well (all part of this
new thing where Apple have invented Spotify, obviously). I let that start doing
its thing and that's where things got odd. First it started the update and the
iPod appeared to insist that it wasn't plugged into the iMac, even though it
was. Then I gave it a second go (after unplugging it and plugging it in
again) and it all seemed to go through just fine, only...</p>

<p>...while the iPod was pretty sure it was now running iOS 8.4, iTunes on the iMac
had other ideas:</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.22.16.png"></p>
<p>The following morning iTunes kept insisting that it needed to do the update
so, even though the iPod was obviously up to date, I let it do it anyway. After
it'd gone through the update process again it still insisted that the iPod
was running 8.3 rather than 8.4. Until, that is, I unplgged it and plugged it
back in again.</p>
<p><img alt="When is 8.4 not 8.4, iTunes?" src="/attachments/2015/07/01/Screen Shot 2015-07-01 at 10.26.20.png"></p>
<p>So now it all seems fine. I just had to do a variation on "have you tried
turning it off and on again?"</p>
<p>Once again I find myself running into things on a Mac that are very common
elsewhere, on other operating systems, and which Mac owners would often have
you believe weren't an issue.</p><p>There are <a href="/2015/07/01/odd-ipod-update.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
