</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's been very quiet on the blogging front, I'm afraid, mostly for <a href="/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html">the
reasons I wrote about back in December last
year</a>. In that time I've been really
very busy with work (in a good way, in a <em>very</em> good way) and there's not a
whole lot of time to be toying with pet projects at home.</p>
<p>However, finding myself with a spare hour or so, I wanted to write about
something I did run into as part of some development at work, and which I
thought might be worth writing about in case it helps someone else.</p>
<p>Recently I've needed to write a library of code for loading data from Excel
Workbooks. Given that the vast majority of coding I do at the moment is in
Python, it made sense to make use of
<a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/">openpyxl</a>. The initial prototype code I
wrote worked well and it soon grew into a full-blown library that'll be used
in a couple of work-related projects.</p>
<p>But one thing kept niggling me... It just wasn't as fast as I'd expected.
The workbooks I'm pulling data from aren't that large, and yet it was taking
a noticeable number of seconds to read in the data, and when I let the code
have a go at a directory full of such workbooks... even the fan on the
machine would ramp up.</p>
<p>It didn't seem right.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of profiling and could see that the code was spending
most of its time deep in the guts of some XML-parsing functions. While I
know that an <code>xlsx</code> file is pretty much an XML document, it seemed odd to me
that it would take so much time and effort to pull the data out from it.</p>
<p>Given that I had other code to be writing, and given that the
workbook-parsing code was "good enough" for the moment, I moved on for a
short while.</p>
<p>But, a couple of weeks back, I had a bit of spare time and decided to
revisit it. I did some more searching on openpyxl and speed issues and
almost everything I found said that the common problem was failing to open
the workbook in <code>read_only</code> mode. That can't have been my problem because
I'd being doing that from the very start.</p>
<p>Eventually I came across a post somewhere (sorry, I've lost it for now --
I'll try and track it down again) that suggested that openpyxl was very slow
to read from a workbook if you were reading one cell at a time, rather than
using generators. The suggestion being that every time you pull a value form
a cell, it has to parse the whole sheet up to that cell. Generators, on the
other hand, would allow access to all the cells during one parse.</p>
<p>This seemed a little unlikely to me -- I'd have expected the code to cache
the parsing results or something like that -- but it also would explain what
I was seeing. So I decided to give it a test.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davep/openpyxl-speed-issue"><code>openpyxl-speed-issue</code></a> is a
version of the tests I wrote and ran and they absolutely show that there's a
huge difference between cell-by-cell access vs generator access.</p>
<p>Code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_row</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_column</span> <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sheet</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="p">][</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is <em>far slower</em> than something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">wb</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test Sheet&quot;</span> <span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">cell</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here's an example of the difference in time, as seen on my iMac:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>make<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">test</span>
pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="w"> </span>./read-using-generators
<span class="w">        </span><span class="m">1</span>.59<span class="w"> </span>real<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.44<span class="w"> </span>user<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.04<span class="w"> </span>sys
pipenv<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="w"> </span>./read-using-peeking
<span class="w">       </span><span class="m">25</span>.02<span class="w"> </span>real<span class="w">        </span><span class="m">24</span>.88<span class="w"> </span>user<span class="w">         </span><span class="m">0</span>.10<span class="w"> </span>sys
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the cell-by-cell approach is about 16 times slower than the
generator approach.</p>
<p>In most circumstances the generator approach would make most sense anyway,
and in any other situation I probably would have used it and never have
noticed this. However, the nature of the workbooks I need to pull data from
means I need to "peek ahead" to make decisions about what I'm doing, so a
more traditional loop over, with an index, made more sense.</p>
<p>I can easily "fix" this by using the generator approach to build up a
two-dimensional array of cells, acquired via the generator; so I can still
do what I want <em>and</em> benefit from using generators.</p>
<p>In conclusion: given that I found it difficult to find information about my
speed issue, and given that the one off-hand comment I saw that suggested it
was this wasn't exactly easy to find, I thought I'd write it all down too
and <a href="https://github.com/davep/openpyxl-speed-issue">create a repository of some test code to illustrate the
issue</a>. Hopefully someone
else will benefit from this in the future.</p>
