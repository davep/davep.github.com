I was quite late discovering Pinboard; by the looks of things I created my
account and paid my first subscription for it in early 2019. Since then I've
been a pretty avid user and found it really useful. I've even written a
couple of clients for it ([one for
Emacs](https://github.com/davep/pinboard.el) and [one for the
terminal](https://github.com/davep/tinboard)).

During that time it's had its fair share of hiccups and outages, but on the
whole I've found it a stable and useful service.

The service does have its detractors, and concerns over its long-term
stability and how well it's maintained [are fairly
common](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34062802). I half paid
attention to these, and had started to think about where I might go if there
was an issue.

While maintaining and syncing bookmarks isn't exactly a difficult or
unsolved problem, and while it's also true that it could be fun to roll my
own solution, there are a couple of things I need that would make building
my own approach a bit of a chore.

Things important to me are:

- An extension for any random browser I might find myself using
- A good mobile client for at least iOS and iPadOS
- A good API so I can write my own tools if I need to
- A clean and focused backend website

I kept these things in mind and kept an eye out but I'd never really felt
the need to actively start looking around.

Then I [stumbled on this](https://sfba.social/@peterme/112915495895055170)
after posting about [another Pinboard
outage](https://fosstodon.org/@davep/112925762265869565).

That... yeah, that was the final push I needed to start to think seriously
about where to move and how.

A couple of people suggested [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io), and from what
I could tell it was coming up as a pretty popular service that some Pinboard
users were migrating to. I had a look and it wasn't *quite* what I was
after; but close.

You see, there's two things I really like about Pinboard that Raindop didn't
seem to cover:

- Simple support for "this shit is unread". I see things, I share to
  whatever Pinboard app I have on my phone or tablet, etc, and then I review
  some time later (normally in
  [Tinboard](https://github.com/davep/tinboard)).
- Support for Private and Public pins. I've liked [having a feed of
  bookmarks I can let people see](https://pinboard.in/u:davep) and Raindrop
  doesn't have this.

I looked around at some blogs that talked about Pinboard vs Raindrop and
didn't see any that really dived into this particular aspect of migrating; I
also asked a couple of folk who'd made the move about this and they didn't
really have any insight (mainly because they didn't care about those
particular uses).

One thing I did notice though was that Raindrop *does* support making
individual collections public. So, if I was willing to sacrifice any other
uses for collections (a bookmark in Raindrop can only be in one collection),
I could simply have a *Public* and a *Private* collection and import pins
into the appropriate one. Also, unread pins could be left out of the
collections and I could use that to signify unread status.

This seemed fine as I'm heavy on the tags anyway.

Now... Raindrop has a pretty comprehensive import facility built in. I gave
it a try with Pinboard's backup file and it worked really well. That is...
really well except it just threw away the public/private/unread aspect of
the pins. There was only one thing for it then: I had to write my own
importer!

Which brings me to [`Paindrop`](https://github.com/davep/paindrop). It's a
quick hack but it does the job, and it does the import just how I wanted.
The result of the first test was pretty much spot on (in this image I'm
comparing what Raindrop says vs what Tinboard says I have in Pinboard):

Usage is pretty straightforward. You create `Public` and `Private`
collections in Raindrop, you create an app in Raindrop and get the access
token, you grab your Pinboard access token and then:

```sh
$ paindrop example:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

where the first parameter is the Pinboard access token and the second the
Raindrop access token.

If all goes well, after a few moments, the importer should finish and you
should find that all of your pins have migrated to Raindrop, all public pins
are in the `Public` collection and all private pins are in the `Private`
collection. Any pins that were marked as unread will be *Unsorted*.

Note that if you used different names for your public and private
collections you can pass those names to `paindrop` with the `--public` and
`--private` switches.

If you're looking to move your bookmarking history out of Pinboard and want
to keep the same sort of structure I had I hope Paindrop will be useful to
you too.

Paindrop can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/paindrop/). It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `paindrop`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install paindrop
```

The [source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/davep/paindrop).

PS: As for the name... originally it was `pin2rain` but then [Darren Burns
pointed out the obvious and it had to
happen](https://fosstodon.org/@darrenburns/112978377299333401).
