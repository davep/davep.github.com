I think I need to rethink the meaning of the word "certainly". Anyone still
bothering to read this blog will recall
that, [last week](/2016/10/24/virgin_east_coast_18.html), the Customer
Relations Manager at Virgin East Coast said:

> If you can leave this with me I will certainly be in contact early next
> week to try and get this resolved once and for all. In the meantime I will
> pop a further couple of tickets in the post for you, just so you have them
> incase you need to travel urgently.

That email was received last Thursday evening. It's now the following
Thursday. Personally I'd take "certainly", in the above, to mean that
there's little to no chance that I won't be contacted in the early part of
this week, and that there's little to no chance that the tickets won't
arrive in the early part of this week.

I'd have thought that "certainly" would be used to create a huge contrast
between what has gone on before, and what will follow.

But, like I say, it's Thursday the following week and I've had no call from
anyone about the Ticket Wallet app, I've had no call or email from Mike (the
Customer Relations Manager) and the tickets haven't tumbled through the
door.

I'm not surprised. I'm not in the least bit surprised. I am, however, rather
disappointed.

And, of course, I'm now going to have to chase things up *again*.
