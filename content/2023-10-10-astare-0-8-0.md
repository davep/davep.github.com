[`textual-astare`](https://github.com/davep/textual-astview) is another
Textual-based Python project that I've developed in the last year and I
don't believe I've mentioned on this blog. Simply put, it's a took for
viewing the abstract syntax tree of Python code, in the terminal.

I've just made a small update to it this evening after someone asked [for a
sensible change I've been meaning to do for a
while](https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions/12). When I
first read the request I *was* going to look at it next week, when I have
some time off work, but you know how it is when you sit at your desk and
have a "quick look".

So anyway, yeah, [v0.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/textual-astview/) is out
there and can be installed, with the main changes being:

- Updated [`textual-fspicker`](https://github.com/davep/textual-fspicker)
- Updated [`textual`](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.39.0)
- Made it so you can open a directory to browser from the command line.
- Made opening the current working directory the default.
- Tweaked the way dark/light mode get toggled so that it's now
  command-palette-friendly.

I think the code does need a wee bit of tidying -- this was one of my
earliest apps built with Textual and my approach to writing Textual apps has
changed a fair bit this year, and Textual itself has grown and improved in
that time -- but it's still working well for now.
