Although it's not planned this way, so far it looks like I'm on a "every
other day" release cycle with Tinboard right now! Today's release is a small
but handy one, I think.

Thanks to the handy little library
[`pyperclip`](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip) I've added:

- The ability to copy a bookmark's URL to the clipboard.
- URL field autofill if you go to add a new bookmark and the clipboard
  appears to have a valid URL in it.

![The code for copying to the clipboard](/attachments/2023/12/25/copy-to-clipboard.png#centre)

At the moment the copy facility is just a straightforward copy of the URL,
nothing else. At some point I may add an extended copy option, which will
open a dialog with a bunch of options of what to copy from the bookmark, and
perhaps also how to format it or something. Like, often, if I'm copying a
bookmark's URL, it's because I want to paste it into some Markdown document,
or some location that will handle Markdown markup.

Perhaps that'll turn up in v0.5.0 in a couple of days? ;-)

Tinboard can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/). The [source is available on
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/tinboard).
