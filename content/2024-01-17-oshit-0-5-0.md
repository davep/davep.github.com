Just a wee catch-up post about OSHit, [my terminal-based HackerNews
browser](https://github.com/davep/oshit). Over the past couple of weeks I've
made some small changes, so I thought I'd make mention of what I've done.

As of v0.5.0, which I released earlier today, I've:

- Added a quick way of following links while viewing a comment. While a
  comment is highlighted you can press <kbd>l</kbd> to follow a link; if
  there's more than one link in the comment a menu will be shown and you can
  select which one to follow.
- Added support for viewing polls. Polls seem to be few and far between on
  HackerNews, so when I published the first version of OSHit I didn't have
  one to hand to test any code against. Eventually one turned up and broke
  OSHit (on purpose; I wanted to see when that happened) so I could then add
  the code to load polls and show them. Right now it just shows scores; I
  might do actual charts at some point.
- Added optional item numbers in the lists; turned on/off with
  <kbd>F4</kbd>.

So far all small things, but handy little improvements. There's still a nice
TODO list in the README and I will slowly work through it. Along with
[tinboard](https://github.com/davep/tinboard) these are two applications
that have absolutely turned into "daily drivers", so they're going to get a
lot of tweaking over the next few weeks, probably even months.
