I almost feel bad admitting this. For someone my age it feels like a thing
you should not really admit, but here goes... I only saw [Little Shop of
Horrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(film)) for
the first time back in 2020. Don't ask me why. I just... never got round to
it. I've known plenty of people who have seen it and loved it. I had a
girlfriend for a while in the late 80s who was obsessed with it. She, like
plenty of people I know, would quote all the quotes from it.

And yet... yeah, I never got round to seeing it.

Until 2020. On first viewing it became really bloody obvious why so many
people seem to love it.

So you can imagine my delight when, earlier this week, I was fighting
through the Edinburgh crowds to get to my bus home and I saw this:

Oh yes please! Oh so yes please! Given my desire to try and take in [a few
more Fringe shows that I normally
would](/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html), this year, this seemed like
a perfect fit. It also solved the choice paralysis problem for at least one
week (really, have you *seen* how much there is on offer?).

So today I booked some tickets for myself and a couple of friends. Next
week's "try and see at least one Fringe show" problem is solved: I'm going
to go and see [a performance of Little Shop of
Horrors](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/little-shop-of-horrors).
