After having knocked up [obs2nlm the other day](/2026/01/10/obs2nlm.html) I
realised there was another source of sources available to me that might be
fun to throw into NotebookLM: [one or more of the Norton Guide files in my
collection](/2025/12/12/norton-guide-collection.html)!

And so, after a wee bit of hacking on a wet Sunday afternoon,
[`ng2nlm`](https://ng2nlm.davep.dev) was born.

In terms of what it does, it's pretty much the same as `obs2nlm`, only it
uses [`ngdb`](https://ngdb.davep.dev) to read the contents of a Norton Guide
and turn it into a single Markdown file which can then be used as a source
in NotebookLM.

So far it seems to be working a treat.

Here I grabbed the guide to assembly language Norton Guide, and the DOS
interrupts Norton Guide, turned them into sources, created a notebook and
let it do its thing.

I can't vouch for how valid the answer to my question is -- it's a *long*
time since I wrote any 8086 assembler code and it's a moment since I last
had to dig into DOS interrupts and the like -- but I like the result.

Probably the biggest issue I see at the moment is with the code examples: it
seems to have a habit of adding some sort of citation marker that links to
nowhere when it's emitting code. I *think* this is down to the instructions
I've given it in the source I output, at least that's what it's suggesting
when I ask it:

> **Me:** What are all the numbers in square brackets for?
>
> **NotebookLM:** The numbers in square brackets are passage indices used to
> cite which specific part of the sources supports each statement
> [Instruction]. Within the source files themselves, these markers identify
> distinct entries or sections within the Norton Guide databases.

Given I am trying to encourage it to cite its sources, I think this is where
the confusion comes from. In "normal" paragraphs it does do a good job of
citing its source *and linking to it*:

![NotebookLM citing a source](/attachments/2026/01/13/cite-source.png#centre)

so presumably, when it "thinks" it's outputting code it doesn't do the
markup to actually do the linking, and so things end up looking a little
confused.

If I ask that citations aren't included in the code, this does seem to have
the desired effect:

![No citations in the code](/attachments/2026/01/13/no-citation-in-code.png#centre)

So, given this, perhaps I can use the
[`--additional-instructions`](https://ng2nlm.davep.dev/#-a-additional-instructions)
switch for the particular source to encourage it to not add citation links
to code? Or of course I could tweak `ng2nlm` itself to include that
instruction to start with. While it's a little specific to one use case,
Norton Guide files do tend to be coding-related so it could make sense.

Anyway, in the very unlikely event that you have a need to turn one or more
Norton Guide files into sources to throw at NotebookLM or similar tools:
[`ng2nlm`](https://github.com/davep/ng2nlm) exists.
