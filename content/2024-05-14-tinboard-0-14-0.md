I've just released [Tinboard](https://github.com/davep/tinboard) v0.14.0.
This release adds a [feature that a user
requested](https://github.com/davep/tinboard/issues/49), where you can set
the default values for the privacy and read-later status of a new bookmark:

![The application settings dialog](/attachments/2024/05/15/app-settings.png#centre)

So, any time you create a new bookmark, the edit dialog will use those
values by default. It's a feature that makes perfect sense but I didn't
think to add it early on because... well, I set the defaults to my
preference.

Tinboard can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/). It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `tinboard`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install tinboard
```

The [source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/davep/tinboard).
