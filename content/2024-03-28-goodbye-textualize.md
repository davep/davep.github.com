While I have been [on the receiving end of redundancy once
before](/2017/12/12/on_to_something_new.html), that was after 21 years of
service at a company that, while it was in part about software development,
I would never have called it a "tech" company.

So, as of today, I can finally say that the "[tech
layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/tech-layoffs-2023-list/)" came
for me and I'm one of 67% of employees being let go from a tech startup.

Achievement unlocked, I guess?

To be clear: I'm not annoyed about this, I'm not even shocked about this; I
planned for this from the off and realised and recognised the gamble I was
taking [back in 2022](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1574118265063972864).

I am disappointed about this. Not in a "I'm disappointed in you" kind of
way, but disappointed for all involved and what it says about how FOSS
projects are funded and maintained.

It's been an interesting journey, and it's been a privilege to do something
I've been wanting to do since the 1990s, when I first read the GNU Manifesto
and subsequently watched the free software and open source movements develop
and grow: work on FOSS for a living. In doing this I've developed my
thoughts about the feasibility of such an endeavour, I've refined how I feel
about working in very small teams, I've learnt a lot of useful lessons I'm
going to draw on in the future (keeping a journal of my experience has been
a great move; I have a lot of notes and thoughts written down that I'll be
reviewing and distilling for myself over the coming weeks).

Most of all: it's been an absolute blast working on something that people
are actually using to build [cool
things](https://github.com/davep/transcendent-textual), and to [provide help
and guidance to those people when they've needed
it](https://textual.textualize.io/help/).

So... what happens now? Well, of course, right now, I'm looking for a new
position. If you're reading this and you are looking for someone who's kinda
handy with Python [and a bunch of other languages](https://github.com/davep)
and who loves learning new stuff, or if you know someone who is looking for
such a person, [do drop me a line](mailto:davep@davep.co.uk)!

As for what happens with Textual, and my involvement with it...

Well, what happens *with* Textual is
[Will](https://github.com/willmcgugan)'s call, of course. As for my
involvement with it: I care about FOSS and I care about Textual; I also care
about the folk who have been kind enough to use their time to explore it,
test it, build with it, commit to it and make neat stuff with it. My
intention, as long as free time allows, is to carry on being involved, both
on GitHub and in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr).

It's my sincere hope that, as a community of FOSS-friendly developers, we
see Textual over the 1.0 line and beyond.

But all that starts next week. It's a bank holiday weekend and I think I
might have deserved a run, a bit of [mucking about in
VR](https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson), a beer, and just a wee bit of
down time.
