More than ever I'm listening to music while I work. Despite having grown up
in the 80s, and so having a good vinyl collection, and then having got into
buying all the CDs in the 90s and 00s, these days I have managed to embrace
the "just stream all the things" approach. After a long time using Spotify I
finally ended up migrating to Apple Music.

One of the things I do find Apple Music does well is the whole "you seem to
like this, have you tried this?" thing; which on occasion has resulted in a
pretty neat rabbit hole of discovery.

Earlier this year this happened with female-fronted Dutch goth/rock type
bands. I don't even remember how that happened, but it's a thing that
happened and I gleefully dived right in. I came away with a few names I
didn't know before, but one album has really stuck in my head and, now that
we're just over 1/2 way through the year, I feel it's the one that gets
played more than anything else.

This keeps creeping back to the top of things I'm playing; sometimes when
I'm in "bang on the keyboard lots" coding mode (you know the sort of coding
mode: where you don't have to think too much because you have a good plan
for what you're doing, but you've got a lot of tapping away to do), plus
also often while I'm in the car.

I won't be the least it surprised to find that this ends up being my
most-played album this year. According to last.fm it's at the top of the
albums I've played (in places where I have scrobbling set up) in the last
365 days.
