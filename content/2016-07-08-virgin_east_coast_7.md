Little update on the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app saga. After
[my previous reply to them](/2016/07/06/virgin_east_coast_6.html) I got a
reply back yesterday:

While it's taken quite a while, it looks like I'm finally making some
progress. If I'm reading it right they finally acknowledge that there is a
problem and that it needs fixing. It's frustrating that I've had to go
backwards and forwards a few times to get to this point.

Monday will be interesting.
