Yesterday, realising
[it had been a week since I'd last had any contact with Virgin East Coast support](/2016/06/20/virgin_east_coast_3.html),
I dropped them a line to find out what was going on. Given that they'd
generally been pretty quick to reply and deal with things initially (albeit
in ways that didn't really seem to fix the problem) it seemed odd that
they'd gone so quiet.

I've had a reply this morning:

Honestly, this is starting to get silly now. I don't mind so much that
they've been slow in getting back to me on the problem because they've been
waiting on "second line support" to get back to them, but that doesn't seem
to really make sense in the light of them saying afterwards that my email
address doesn't even show in their system.

Really, if they can "see" that I'm not even registered in their system, why
would they have passed things to "second line support"? That makes no sense.

But, actually, it gets even worse. During
[my original phone conversion with them](/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html)
the lady I spoke to made the exact same claim. She told me that my email
address wasn't even in the system, hadn't been registered via the
website. Of course it had (I even sent the initial message for support from
their website, while logged in). I pointed this out and she went off to look
into it; she came back to say it was there now. When I asked what had
happened she mumbled something about how there'd been a problem and she'd
got someone to fix it.

No, I have no exact details about it, but quite simply she said I wasn't in
the system, I provided her good evidence I was and then she made "magic"
happen and suddenly I was visible.

But, now, apparently, I'm not visible again.

Either someone at Virgin East Coast is fibbing to me, or their system has a
bad habit of losing people's details. It's not like I'm so stupid to think
I've registered but actually haven't. I can log into the website with the
details I registered with. I've had a member of staff confirm I'm in the
system. I've had subsequent support chats take place where the person I'm
dealing with is satisfied that I exist in the system. I even had them ask me
to try and reset my password -- something I imagine isn't possible if you've
not even registered with the system yet!

This is getting really silly now. This is possibly getting beyond silly.

The serious side of this is, of course, I can't trust the Virgin East Coast
website or their booking system, so I have to continue using a third party,
which means Virgin still get to grab an extra tenner off me on every trip so
I can have WiFi and get some work done.
