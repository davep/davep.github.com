It's now a week
[since I last wrote an update](/2016/09/22/virgin_east_coast_14.html) and,
given that I'm sat on a Virgin East Coast train right now, I thought I'd do
another.

As mentioned last time, I'm currently waiting for a call from someone at
Virgin East Coast regarding the ongoing situation with the Android Ticket
Wallet application. It's
[now over 3 months since I first ran into the problem](/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html)
(and, of course, ran into all the issues of trying to get some sensible help
and response from them) and nothing has really improved:

It's now [around six weeks](/2016/08/10/virgin_east_coast_12.html) since I
was promised a call from someone who works on the application; a call that
did come the once but I couldn't answer at the time (I'm not the sort of
person to fiddle with a phone while driving) and which I attempted to return
for the better part of 2 weeks afterwards but never even got an answer to
the calls.

It's now also 3 weeks since I was told that I'd get a call from the boss of
the person who was originally supposed to call me. I've yet to receive a
call from them too. I've mentioned this to Mike Ross on a couple of
occasions now and haven't had any sort of direct reply as to what's going on
with that situation.

While I am enjoying the benefits of the tickets I was provided as
compensation from the earlier troubles (and also very much appreciating
Mike's reserving of seats for me when I need them -- I do find that booked
seats take a lot of stress out of traveling) I'd really love to get to the
bottom of the problem with the Ticket Wallet app.

Frustratingly and amusingly I suspect I'll finally get an answer around the
time I don't need to use the train quite so much.
