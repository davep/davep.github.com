Now and again Google seem to actually listen. While they do generally have a
bad habit of removing things from things and saying it's for everyone's good
(because options are bad and they can't maintain them, apparently) it seems
they *can* do the odd turnaround now and again.

One thing they removed from Android recently was the
"[until next alarm](/2015/11/12/i-miss-until-next-alarm.html)""
option when putting a device in "do not disturb" mode.

Seems they've added that back in 6.0.1:

![Google sees sense](/attachments/2015/12/17/Screenshot_20151217-112015.png)

It's a small thing, but it makes so much more sense and makes things so much
easier (even if it's a trivial thing).

Nice one Google. More of this please.
