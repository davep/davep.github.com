I'm going to file this one under "it seems really unnecessary, but it's also
kinda cool". While reading up about
[protocols](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html)
the book I'm reading introduced the `ExpressibleBy*Literal` protocols, where
the `*` is one of a number of obvious literals. For example:
`ExpressibleByStringLiteral`. As you might imagine, it lets you create a
class that can be initialised with a literal value, as opposed to needing to
appear to call the constructor for a class.

So, for a silly example:

```swift
class Hello : ExpressibleByStringLiteral {

    private let what : String

    required init( stringLiteral what : String ) {
        self.what = what
    }

    func say() {
        print( "Hello, \(self.what)!" )
    }
}
```

You could, of course, write this:

```swift
let v1 = Hello( "world" )
v1.say()
```

but because of `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` you can also write:

```swift
let v2 : Hello = "universe"
v2.say()
```

Now, sure, in this case it saves you nothing, but this does also mean that
parameters of functions whose type uses one of the ``ExpressibleBy*Literal`
protocols can be passed a literal, rather than a "long-hand" instantiated
object. For example:

```swift
func Greet( _ h : Hello ) {
    h.say()
}

Greet( "davep" )
```

I can see that being quite handy.
