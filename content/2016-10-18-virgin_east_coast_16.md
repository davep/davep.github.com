It's now almost 2 weeks
since [I last posted an update here](/2016/09/29/virgin_east_coast_15.html)
and, frustratingly, I don't really have much progress to write about.

What had been a promising start (well, middle; the actual start of this
process was as frustrating as hell; it was
only [when the MD got involved](2016/08/10/virgin_east_coast_12.html) that
things actually started to happen) has turned into more of the same: broken
promises and lack of actual results.

Only, this time, I'm not dealing with some call center. This time I'm
dealing with the office of [David Horne](https://twitter.com/DavidHorne).

Since I last wrote I've emailed Mike Ross three times. The first time was to
chase up what was happening with the promised phone call regarding the
Ticket Wallet app. Here's what I wrote 12 days ago (on 2016-10-06):

This got no reply whatsoever. Now, I appreciate that people can be busy, but
when you have an ongoing issue to resolve with someone it makes sense you at
least say something like "I'm sorry, my attention is elsewhere at the moment
-- I promise I'll get back to you as soon as possible". That's not an ideal
thing to do, especially if your job us customer relations, but at least it
lets the customer know you're there and listening.

But, no, nothing.

So 5 days ago I replied to the above, with a little chaser:

> Hi Mike. Sorry to trouble you but given it's a week since I wrote, I
> wanted to chase this up.

And still nothing.

Later this week I'll be on the trains again and, despite getting no sort of
reply whatsoever from Mike, I decided to drop a line anyway and ask for seat
reservations to be made (as had originally been offered). These were done in
no time at all.

While that is great it also tells me something rather odd: my emails are
being read and acted upon -- at least when they're a request for a seat
reservation -- but they're not being replied to.

And here's the thing that's even *more* frustrating about this. The email
where I requested the seat reservations had this on the end as a PS:

> PS: Did you receive the catch-up email I sent last week? Seeing as how I'm

That has to have been read and... given the lack of reply I can only
conclude that it was ignored. I like to think it wasn't really ignored but a
lack of reply looks *exactly* like you're being ignored.

At this point I don't know what to make of this any more. It's a simple
problem I'm trying to get to the bottom of. I've been made plenty of good
promises, almost all of them broken. On top of that I can't really escalate
the issue any more because I'm already receiving the best help that Virgin
East Coast's MD can offer, apparently.

Anyone got Richard Branson's phone number?
