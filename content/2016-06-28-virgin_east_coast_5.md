Quick update on where things are at with the attempt to get help with the
apparent inability to log into the Virgin East Coast Ticket Wallet app using
an otherwise perfectly valid account...

As mentioned [yesterday](/2016/06/27/virgin_east_coast_4.html) I had an
email from them. I replied (after writing yesterday's blog post):

I also added a couple of screenshots, with explanation, that shows me
logging in with the address they claim doesn't exist in their system.

I've had no reply to my questions so far. I've had no reply at all so far.

After posting yesterday's post I did the usual thing of tweeting it and,
obviously, mentioned [@Virgin_TrainsEC](https://twitter.com/Virgin_TrainsEC)
in the tweet.

This lead to a little exchange on twitter where I mentioned that the main
reason I was trying to switch to Virgin's own system, rather than use
someone line TheTrainLine, was so that I could get the free WiFi and save
myself a tenner each trip.

All credit to Virgin East Coast: they contacted me directly and have
provided me with 10 one-use WiFi access codes to keep me going while this
gets sorted out. It's not a solution to the problem, but it does remove the
extra cost I was trying to get rid of for the next 5 standard class round
trips (I sometimes sneak in a first class journey if the price is too good
to ignore).

So.... no still no solution, but some welcome help from them to be going on
with. Can't grumble at that.
