It pretty much all started with this:

```
 * Revision 1.1  1996/02/15 18:57:13  davep
 * Initial revision
```

That's from the rcs log [for the source for
`w3ng`](https://github.com/davep/w3ng/blob/master/w3ng.c), a tool I wrote so
I could read Norton Guide files in my web browser, served by Apache, running
on my GNU/Linux server in my office. The tool itself was written as a
[CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) tool (remember
them?).

I believe I posted about this to `comp.lang.clipper` and pretty quickly some
folk asked if it might be possible to do a version that would write the
whole guide as a collection of HTML files for static hosting, rather than
serving them from a cgi-bin utility. That seemed like a sensible idea and
so:

```
 * Revision 1.1  1996/03/16 09:49:00  davep
 * Initial revision
```

[`ng2html`](https://github.com/davep/ng2html/blob/master/ng2html.c) was born.

Fast forward around a quarter of a century and I decided it would be fun to
write [a library for Python that reads Norton Guide
files](https://blog.davep.org/ngdb.py/), and a tool called `ng2web` was the
first test I wrote of it, designed as a more flexible replacement for
`ng2html`. I've tweaked and tinkered with the tool since I first created it,
but never actually "finished" it.

That's changed today. I've just released v1.0.0 of `ng2web`.

If turning one or more Norton Guide files into static websites seems like
the sort of thing you want to be doing, [take a look at the
documentation](https://blog.davep.org/ng2web/).

`ng2web` is licensed GPL-3.0 and available [via
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/ng2web) and also [via
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ng2web/). If you have an environment that has
`pipx` installed you should be able to get up and going with:

```sh
$ pipx install ng2web
```
It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `ng2web`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install ng2web
```
