I've [just released AgiNG
v0.3.0](https://github.com/davep/aging/releases/tag/v0.3.0). The main focus
of this release was to get some searching added to the application. Similar
to what I added to [WEG](https://github.com/davep/weg) back in the day, I
wanted three types of searching:

- Current entry search.
- Current guide-wide search.
- All registered guides-wide search.

The current entry search is done with a simple modal input, and for now the
searching is always case-insensitive (I was going to add a switch for this
but it sort of felt unnecessary and I liked how clean the input is).

The search is started by pressing <kbd>/</kbd>, and if a hit is found
<kbd>n</kbd> will take you through all subsequent matches.

As always, if you're not sure of the keys, you'll find them in the help
screen or via the command palette:

Guide-wide and all-guide searching is done in the same dialog. To search
guide-wide you enter what you want to find and untick *"All Guides"*.

With that, the search will stick to the current guide.

As will be obvious, searching all guides that have been registered with
AgiNG is as simple as ticking *"All Guides"*. Then when you search it'll
take a walk through every entry of every guide you've added to the guide
directory in the application.

Global searching is accessed with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/<kbd> or via the
command palette.

With this added, I think that's most of the major functionality I wanted for
AgiNG. I imagine there's a few more tweaks I'll think of (for example: I
think adding regex search to the global search screen could be handy), but I
don't think there's any more big features it needs.

AgiNG can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aging/). It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `aging`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install aging
```
