I've no idea when this happened, and I'll admit that the advice it gives is
advice I've mostly being following anyway for quite a long time, but it seems
that ssh in the ChromeOS terminal has been removed. This is what just happened
when I tried to use it just now:

![ChromeOS ssh no longer working](/attachments/2015/06/19/Screenshot 2015-06-19 at 09.03.58.png)

To be fair, [Chrome Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en)
is pretty damn good and has served me well for the past couple or so years,
working well on the Chromebook and on Windows 7 and 8 (and also now on the Mac,
although I'm tending to use ssh in its native terminal more).

I wonder if any other of the limited features of the ChromeOS terminal (in
non-dev mode anyway) are going to go the same way?

As an aside to the above, something kind of ironic happened as I was writing
this. I opened Chrome so I could preview the post as I was writing it and
I suffered one of Chrome's rather common extension crashes. Look what one of
those extensions was (and I wasn't even using it at the time):

Not exactly the best advert for the non-optional replacement.
