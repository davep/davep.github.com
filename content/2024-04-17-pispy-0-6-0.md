Back in the very early days of the [Textual
adventure](https://blog.davep.org/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html),
within the first month or so of working on the framework, we [had a period
of
dogfooding](https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/11/26/on-dog-food-the-original-metaverse-and-not-being-bored/).
One of the projects I wrote during that time was a little tool [I called
PISpy](https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2022/12/08/be-the-keymaster/#pispy).

The initial version was pretty much a quick hack; during that dogfooding
period I did my best to try and develop a new project every couple of days.
Since then I've let PISpy descend into [bit
rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot).

In the last week or so I've turned my attention back to it and made an
effort to [tidy up the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CepsN8TDq1E),
[tidy it some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EUXA8RkN0), [and some
more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u5CfrgZWcc), and [even some
more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDCvWCZx1AM).

This morning I put the finishing touches to these changes and released
[v0.6.0](https://github.com/davep/pispy/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

[![PISpy in action](/attachments/2024/04/17/pispy-in-action.gif#centre)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/67xtMdstbx4)

PISpy can be installed with `pip` or (ideallty) `pipx` [from
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pispy-client/). It can also be installed with
Homebrew by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `pispy`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install pispy
```

The [source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/davep/pispy).
