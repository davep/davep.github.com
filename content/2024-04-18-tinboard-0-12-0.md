[Tinboard](https://github.com/davep/tinboard) has turned into a tool I use
pretty much every day; it's probably my most-used Textual/Python-developed
application at this point. This is causing me to think more and more about
how I can add things to it that are related to the core purpose, but are
also outside of the main "interface with Pinboard" thing.

A thing with keeping bookmarks for a long time is that some of them go
stale, go away. Some will just plain 404, others the whole site will
disappear. If I find myself going back to a bookmark and seeing this is the
case, I'll hit the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) and see if
there's an archive there.

So I got to thinking: what if I add the ability to perform this check into
Tinboard itself? [So I did just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDgiM6pUP2Y).

Now, in the application, if you press <kbd>w</kbd> with a bookmark
highlighted, it will check with the Wayback Machine to see if the bookmark
is in the archive. If it isn't you see this:

![No archive result](/attachments/2024/04/18/no-archive.png#centre)

On the other hand, if it *is* in the archive, you'll see something like
this:

![Is in the archive result](/attachments/2024/04/18/has-archive.png#centre)

I sense this is going to be the first step in a couple of features related
to this. I'm thinking that I may go on to add a *"swap the URL for this
bookmark with the Wayback Machine archive URL"* feature, which will be handy
for those bookmarks that have one away, and it would also be useful to look
at the options for a *"please archive a copy of this bookmark"* feature.

But, for now, v0.12.0 is available and has this handy (for me anyway) first
step.

Tinboard can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/). It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `tinboard`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install tinboard
```
