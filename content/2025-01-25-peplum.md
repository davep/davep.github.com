I seem to be back in the swing of writing handy (for me) little
terminal-based applications again. Having not long since [released
Braindrop](/2025/01/03/braindrop.html) (which I'm still working on and
tinkering with; it'll get more features in the near future, for sure), I had
an idea for another tool I'd like to have: something for looking through,
searching, and filtering [Python PEPs](https://peps.python.org).

As with anyone who is interested in what's happening with Python itself, I
subscribe to the RSS feed of the latest Python PEPs, but I also wanted
something that would let me look back at older ones in a way that worked
*"just so"* (*"just so" being "what feels right for me"*, of course). Having
finished the main work on Braindrop I realised that the general layout of
its UI would work here, as would the filtering and searching approach I
used.

From this idea [Peplum](https://github.com/davep/peplum) was born!

![Peplum in action](/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum.png)

In this first release I've simply concentrated on all things to do with
grabbing the list of PEPs and presenting them in a useful way; adding
various forms of filtering them; adding the ability to search the metadata;
that sort of thing. I aim to keep developing this out over the next few
weeks and months, adding things like the ability to make notes, to locally
view the text of a PEP, perhaps even to mark PEPs as unread and read, etc.

As I mentioned earlier, much of the design was driven by what I did with
Braindrop, so once again I've tried my very best to make it
keyboard-friendly and as much as possible keyboard-first. This sometimes
means having to work against how Textual works, but generally that isn't too
tricky to do. I'm once again making heavy use of the command palette and
also ensuring that all commands that have corresponding keyboard bindings
are documented in the help screen.

There's enough common code between Peplum and Braindrop, when it comes to
this aspect of building a Textual application, that I'm minded to spin it
out into a little library of its own. I'm going to sit on this code for a
wee while and see how it develops, but I can see me taking this approach
with future applications and doing this will stop the need to copy and
paste.

It might also be useful to others building with Textual.

Also as with Braindrop, themes are a thing, and the theme setting is sticky
so you can set it the once and stick with that you like. Here's some
examples:

![Nord](/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-nord.png)
![Catppuccin Latte](/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-catppuccin-latte.png)
![Tokyo Night](/attachments/2025/01/25/peplum-tokyo-night.png)

That's a small selection of the themes, with more to explore.

While working on this project I managed to find a couple more bugs in
Textual, including [a fun way to get `transparent` backgrounds to get out of
sync](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5488) and also a way to
get [an easy crash out of `OptionList` if it's set to `width:
auto`](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5489).

What was even more fun was I sort of [discovered a bug in the Python PEP
API](https://fosstodon.org/@davep/113843011699020404). Thanks to
[Hugo](https://fosstodon.org/@hugovk@mastodon.social) noticing my *"huh,
weird"* post on Fosstodon, there's [now an issue for
it](https://github.com/python/peps/issues/4211) as well as [a PR in the
works](https://github.com/python/peps/pull/4226). In retrospect I should
have raised an issue myself; instead I fell into that *"they obviously know
what they're doing so it must be like this for a reason"* trap.

Lesson relearned: it's always better to ask and get an answer, than to
assume a thing is how it is for a reason you don't know; which I guess is a
version of [Linus' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) really.

So that's v0.1.0 out in the wild. I'm pleased with how it's turned out and
there's more to come. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and available [via
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/peplum) and also [via
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/peplum/). If you have an environment that
has `pipx` installed you should be able to get up and going with:

```sh
$ pipx install peplum
```
It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `peplum`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install peplum
```

I'm going to be making good use of this and working on it more; I hope it's
useful to someone else. :-)
