While [my time working on Textual might have come to an
end](/2024/03/28/goodbye-textualize.html), my time working *with* Textual
hasn't. Three days back [I experimented with Textual's newly-added "inline
mode"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U66oHFLWmG4):

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U66oHFLWmG4?si=kCQba6vMoxpKMtBG"
        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

In doing so I extended the application so that it's possible to run
`tinboard add` and quickly enter a new bookmark and then carry on in the
terminal, without needing to "go fullscreen". I'll admit it's of limited
use, but it seemed like a good shakedown of the feature and in working on it
I was able to discover a couple of bugs
([#4385](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4385),
[#4403](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/4403)).

The effect of this is this:

Tinboard can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/). It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `tinboard`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install tinboard
```

The [source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/davep/tinboard).
