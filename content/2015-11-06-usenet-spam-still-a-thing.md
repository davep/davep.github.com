This just turned up in email a little earlier:

![Yay! Spam!](/attachments/2015/11/06/Screen Shot 2015-11-06 at 13.16.30.png)

What's of particular interest is the email address this was sent to. It was
one that I only ever (to my knowledge) used for posts to Usenet. While my
gmail spam folder is filled with emails to that and other addresses I used
for Usenet over the years this is the first bit of "proper" spam I've had
to it in a long time.

It's signficant that it's some sort of [Xbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBase)-related
thing too. I think the Usenet group I posted to more than any other will have
been [comp.lang.clipper](news:comp.lang.clipper). Unless I had some lapse of
judgement at some point in the late 1990s or early 2000s (I think I only got
the davep.org domain in 1999, now I think about it) the address this was sent
to was used nowhere else.

I've also never been a "Visual Objects and/or Vulcan.NET user". While I did
once own a copy of Visual Objects (two copies actually -- a beta and then a
final release) it wasn't in a way that I'd have been on some mailing list and
even if I had the address in question wouldn't have been the one used.

So, yeah, great way to impress me with a new product: make your first contact
with me look exactly like some old Usenet spam.

**Edit to add:** I've since had it confrimed by the sender of the email that
my address was indeed pulled from [comp.lang.clipper](news:comp.lang.clipper).
