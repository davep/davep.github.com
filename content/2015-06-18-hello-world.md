Hello, world.

So I've decided that it's time I had a blog again. An actual blog. Not a set
of posts on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts) or a torrent
of 140-character thoughts on [twitter](https://twitter.com/davepdotorg) but
an actual blog.

Part of the reason for this is that there's a couple of personal coding projects
I want to have a go at over the next few months and writing about them as I
work on them might be fun. Another reason is that I've being wanting to explore
the business of hosting a blog on GitHub pages for quite some time and now's
the perfect time to do it.

So how am I doing this? Well, for starters, I recently acquired an iMac. The
reasons for how and why I chose to do this are varied and mostly uninteresting
but what it does mean is that, for the first time in quite a long time, I
have a Unix desktop machine again. This fact alone means it's nice and easy
for me to play with the likes of Git (or, at the moment more
[GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) than the command line git), ruby,
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (along with
[a rather nifty package for quickly kicking off a blog post](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll)).
So that's how I'm doing it. Writing it all locally and pushing it up to
GitHub and hosting it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

As this goes on I imagine much will change. I've started out with a basic
setup, created by simply using:

```sh
davep@Ariel:~/blogging$ jekyll new davep.github.com
```

From now on I'll be playing with styles and my own layouts to see what I can
come up with and what I like (although, I most say, for the most part I'm
actually liking the clean look it delivers out of the box).

One thing that's obviously missing right now is a facility for commenting.
That's something I'll look into should I feel it's necessary -- from what I've
seen elsewhere it's easy enough to make use of something like
[disqus](https://disqus.com/). **Update:** This has now happened.

One other thing I might look at doing is putting this behind my own domain.
For the moment it's only available via github.io and I guess it might look
nicer if it was actually available via a URL that looks like the name I've
attached to the blog. **Update:** This has now happened.

Anyway, that's it for now. Time to push this up and think some more about
where it'll go from here.
