I just realised that it's been a while since I [last posted an
update](/2023/12/25/tinboard-0-4-0.html) about `tinboard`. This is probably
my most-used Textual-based application, and one I'm constantly tinkering
with, and just this morning I published v0.10.0.

Often the changes are small tweaks or fixes to how it works, sometimes
they're simply updates to the version of Textual used, making use of some
new feature or other; I've yet to add another "major" feature so far. They
will come, but so far the ideas I have for the application haven't actually
felt that necessary. Although I say so myself it does what I need it to do
and it does it really well.

So, as a quick catch-up of what's changed since v0.4.0 (which was the last
version I posted about):

- v0.5.0 was released 2024-01-04; this included all the tags of a bookmark
when doing full-text searching.
- v0.6.0 was released 2024-01-10; it fixed a small bug where the tag
suggestion facility got confused by trailing spaces in the input field.
- v0.7.0 was released 2024-02-02; this updated the minimum Textual version to
v0.48.2 and removed all the custom changes to the Textual `TextArea` widget,
making use of the updates to `TextArea` that version of Textual made
available.
- v0.8.0 was released 2024-02-18; this fixed a crash on startup caused by a
newer release of Textual (the fault was in `tinboard`; the update to Textual
helped reveal the problem).
- v0.9.0 was released 2024-02-29; it simply added support for using
<kbd>Esc</kbd> at the top level of the application to quit (I like to camp
on <kbd>Esc</kbd> to GTFO).

Then, just now, I released v0.10.0. This release makes full use of [some
work I recently did to enhance Textual's `CommandPalette`
widget](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/4154), which added a
"discover" system. The change in `tinboard` is that all of the [command
palette
providers](https://github.com/davep/tinboard/tree/main/tinboard/commands)
now have `discover` methods too. The result of this change is that when you
open the command palette in `tinboard` (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) you
can see *every* possible command right away.

Tinboard can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/). The [source is available on
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/tinboard).
