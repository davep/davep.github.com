Following on from [the initial full release a couple of days
ago](/2023/12/19/tinboard.html), I've just [released v0.2.0 of
Tinboard](https://github.com/davep/tinboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0). There's
just one small change in this, but I think it's a really useful one.

In the top-left corner of the screen there's a menu of main filters, letting
you switch between seeing all bookmarks, or a combination of read, unread,
public, private, etc... In using the application I quickly realised that it
would be handy to have bookmark counts in that menu.

So I added that:

![Counts in the filters menu](/attachments/2023/12/21/filters-menu.png#centre)

These counts are a little different from those in the tags list, in that
they always show the number of matching bookmarks amongst *all recorded
bookmarks*, not just those currently on display (and so subject to any sort
of filter that's in play).

I *think* this is the right approach here. I know for sure that that's what
I want from this, and I am writing this for me after all...

What's handy about this is that it makes it easier for me to see how many
bookmarks haven't been tagged, and also how many I haven't looked back over
and marked as read. This is already helping me get to untagged-zero.

Tinboard can be installed with `pip` or (ideally) `pipx` [from
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tinboard/). The [source is available on
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/tinboard).
