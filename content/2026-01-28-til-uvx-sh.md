In the past few months, like a lot of folk in the Python world, I've been
won over by [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). When it comes to managing my
own projects my journey over the past few years as been
[`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), then
[`rye`](https://rye.astral.sh), and then when rye was killed off I finally
swapped to `uv` (later than I should have, I realised in hindsight). At each
step I've found each tool cleaner, easier to work with and more
feature-rich.

There's no doubt in my mind that `uv` has done the most work to make
installing Python-based tools (or at least PyPI-based tools) [as
friction-free an experience as
possible](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/).

Now I've discovered [uvh.sh](https://uvx.sh). The thing with `uv` is the
person installing your application first needs to get and install `uv`; this
site removes that friction. Now if someone wants to install
[obs2nlm](https://obs2nlm.davep.dev) (for example) they should be able to
just do:

```sh
curl -LsSf uvx.sh/obs2nlm/install.sh | sh
```

and away they go (assuming they have [curl](https://curl.se) installed,
which is generally going to be far more likely than having `uv` installed).

Of course, there are [the usual caveats and
concerns](https://www.djm.org.uk/posts/protect-yourself-from-non-obvious-dangers-curl-url-pipe-sh/)
about the *"just pipe this stuff via `sh` trust me bro"* approach, but if
you are comfortable with suggesting this kind of install method it looks
worth adding this to an application's installation documentation.

I think I'm going to start mentioning it as an option.
