My [experiment with coding with an
agent](/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html) continues, and from the
point of view of the usability of the results, I'd say it's going well. From
the point of view of learning more about this sort of tool and the pitfalls:
I'd also say it's going well.

The one thing I'm really starting to get an appreciation for is just how
much it employs a sort of *brute force and ignorance* approach to getting to
a solution for some sort of problem. I noticed this on and off as I watched
the agent's chat, as it worked away.

One example I enjoyed was when it was trying to add a new dependency to
[BlogMore](https://blogmore.davep.dev/). For reasons I should probably try
and understand[^1] it knew it should be using `uv` to add a dependency and
it knew how to use it to update the lock file, but it didn't have `uv` to
hand:

> The lock file (uv.lock) needs to be updated to include rcssmin. Since uv
> isn't available, I'll need to note this in the PR. The lock file should be
> generated by uv when the pyproject.toml is updated.

So it decided the best solution was probably to... "hand-edit" the lock
file.

> The lock file needs to be updated with rcssmin. Since uv is not available
> in this environment, I need to update it manually or find another way.
>
> I need to update the uv.lock file to include rcssmin. The uv.lock file needs to include:
>
> 1. The rcssmin package entry with hashes
> 2. The rcssmin dependency in the blogmore package section
>
> Let me look at the PyPI page for rcssmin 1.2.2 to get the hash.

It then grabs `rcssmin` from PyPI and checks out the information it wants;
after which it goes:

> I need to update the `uv.lock` file with the rcssmin package information.
> The `uv.lock` file uses SHA256 hashes. Let me look at the existing format
> in more detail to understand what I need to add, and then I'll query PyPI

So... around this point it has some sort of plan for hand-patching the lock
file, but also recognises that this is a dodgy approach and it should be
using `uv` to update the lock file.

I also really like the part where it says it has two options, then goes on
to provide an exhaustive list of... one.

After this it runs this code:

```python
import json, urllib.request
url = 'https://pypi.org/pypi/rcssmin/json'
try:
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url, timeout=10) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    v = '1.2.2'
    releases = data['releases'].get(v, [])
    for r in releases:
        print(f'filename: {r[\"filename\"]}')
        print(f'  url: {r[\"url\"]}')
        print(f'  sha256: {r[\"digests\"][\"sha256\"]}')
        print(f'  size: {r[\"size\"]}')
        print(f'  upload_time: {r[\"upload_time_iso_8601\"]}')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error: {e}')
```

after which it concludes:

> Now I have all the information I need to update the uv.lock file. I need to add:
>
> 1. The rcssmin package entry in the lock file
> 2. Add rcssmin to the blogmore package dependencies

I mean... okay, I guess. Again, I'll admit that I'm still getting used to
setting this sort of thing up and working with it (and keep in mind none of
this was done locally; this is all via GitHub Copilot, up on GitHub), but
it's kind of funny and wild that the approach taken was to recognise that
using `uv` to remake the lock file was the best approach so... let's
hand-edit the lock file.

But that's not the best part. This is where it gets really fun. It had
decided that the lock file *must* be in alphabetical order. Okay, sure, why
not:

> The lock file has packages sorted alphabetically, so rcssmin should go
> between pygments and python-dateutil (since "r" comes before "py"
> actually... no, wait - "r" comes after "p" in the alphabet. Let me check
> the order again).

Since "r" comes before "py."

**Since "r" comes before "py."**

o_O

O_o

Extra credit here for giving me a good giggle. I really appreciate the way
that it catches itself mid-sentence and remembers how the alphabet actually
works.

As to the outcome of all of this? Sure, [the feature I wanted to
add](https://github.com/davep/blogmore/issues/158) [got
added](https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/161); it worked away and got
to a working solution in the end. But the route it took was, I think it's
fair to say, a *"brute force and ignorance"* approach.

I've not been spending too much time reading the agent's own chatter, but
when I have I've found myself amused by the dead ends it'll wander down and
then work its way back out. There is, without question, a recognisable
process here: I believe it would be a dishonest developer who says they've
*never* had times in the past, or just one of those off days, where they've
fallen down a rabbit hole of a solution, only to realise it's the right
solution implemented in the worst possible way. There's also a resemblance
here to how more junior developers work a problem until they really develop
their skills.

I think I'm going to keep an eye on the agent chat a bit more from now on.
While I imagine things will only improve as these tools improve, for the
moment it's a good source of coding comedy.
