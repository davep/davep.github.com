title: Dot Files
---

Like lots of people, I have a collection of "dot files"[^1] that I keep in
easily-accessible repositories. On the off chance that the content of them
are useful to anyone, here's a list of some (most, ideally all!) of them.

- [Emacs](https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d)
- [Fish](https://github.com/davep/fish)
- [Kitty](https://github.com/davep/kitty)
- [Python REPL](https://github.com/davep/.pythonrc.d)

[^1]: Lots of them don't actually start with a dot these days, of course.
    Most aren't just a file either.
