## About the site

A blog that has wandered from place to place, but has (hopefully) settled
back here. Mostly it's to do with
[tech](/category/tech.html)/[coding](/category/coding.html) stuff, sometimes
perhaps gaming and video-making stuff, and on occasion [personal
stuff](/category/life.html).

Expect a bit of a mix.

## About me

Initially self-taught back in the early 1980s, I started programming on a
ZX81 and I've been in love with software development ever since. My
"primary" language has drifted over the years, but as it has I've made an
effort to get to know and work with plenty of others.

Most weekends you'll find me playing [VR](/tag/vr.html) games, and
[recording and publishing the
results](https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson/videos).

Many evenings you'll find me [streaming flat-screen gameplay from my
PS5](https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson/streams).

When I'm not [in VR](https://www.youtube.com/user/daveporg) I'm likely out
running, or tinkering with [personal code
projects](https://github.com/davep).
