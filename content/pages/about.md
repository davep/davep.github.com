## About the site

My personal blog which covers [a handful of main topics](/categories.html)
and wanders through [all sorts of subjects](/tags.html). Mostly you'll see
me writing about coding and Python and a bit of Emacs and so on; but
sometimes there will be more random thoughts and personal stuff.

The site itself is all written in Markdown, generated with
[BlogMore](https://github.com/davep/blogmore), and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## About me

Initially self-taught back in the early 1980s, I started programming on a
[ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) and I've been in love with
software development ever since. My "primary" language has drifted over the
years, but as it has I've made an effort to get to know and work with plenty
of others.

When I have the time (although it's not so available at the moment) I love
playing [VR](/tag/vr.html) games, and [recording and publishing the
results](https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson/videos).

Occasionally, some evenings, you'll find me [streaming flat-screen gameplay
from my PS5](https://www.youtube.com/@DavePearson/streams).

When I'm not doing any of those things I'm very likely tinkering with
[personal code projects](https://github.com/davep).
