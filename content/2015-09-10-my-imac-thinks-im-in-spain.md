While on the phone earlier I was doing that thing you often do when chatting
with someone where you don't have to concentrate on something in front of you:
I was randomly clicking around stuff on a machine. In this case I was
faffing around on [my iMac](/2015/06/27/my-first-couple-of-weeks-with-an-imac.html).

One of the places I landed was in the About dialog, looking at the support
details:

Out if idle curiosity I clicked the "OS X Support" link, which opened my
browser and took me to Apple's website. Only.... it didn't take me to a part
of the site that was that useful to me:

Yes, for reasons best known to Apple or my iMac, I apparently need my help to
be in Spanish. O_o

I could understand this if I had my system set to Spanish, which I don't:

About the only "non-standard" thing I have in my setup is the date, which I've
set to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) style rather than
the usual UK style. I even experimented with changing that to the default on
the remote chance that it was tickling some sort of odd bug in OS X.

So, yes, another wonderful example of Apple stuff "just working" and being
good for mortals. Well, for interesting values of "working" anyway.
