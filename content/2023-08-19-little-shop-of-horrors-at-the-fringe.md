As mentioned [just over a week
back](/2023/08/10/little-shop-of-horrors.html), last night I went to see a
Fringe show that was a production of *The Little Shop of Horrors*. Before
going I had no idea what to expect (in terms of how it would be done, not
what the content would be): I wasn't clear if it would be a really small
affair, or something on a bigger stage with reasonably high production
values (what can I say? It was LSoH, it was a Fringe show, it was booked
knowing nothing else).

When we got there and got into the venue it was... small, oh so very small!
No real set to speak of. The cast who were about to kick off the performance
didn't really seem to have much of a costume going on. So, without
judgement, I settled down to expect the next 90 minutes or so to be... a
Fringe experience.

First impressions were oh so wrong! While there was (for obvious reasons) a
lack of any real set, the effort that went into the performance really
worked and I absolutely enjoyed every single moment. Also, because it was a
production of the musical (which I haven't seen), rather than an adaption of
the movie (which I have), I got to experience a fresh ending (spoilers!).

The seats were uncomfortable. The room was down in the basement, with no
ventilation, and so was uncomfortably hot. Physically it wasn't a great
space to be. And yet I really wasn't wishing for it to be over. I think that
says a lot about the show itself.

I think special mention has to be given to the Audrey II models, of which
there were three different sizes. Someone put some real effort into them.

So, yeah, a fun night, topped and tailed with pre-show dinner and post-show
drinks with friends. I couldn't have asked for more.

Unless I last-moment book anything else over the next week, [there's one
more show to go](/2023/08/15/mythos-ragnarok-booked.html) in my [push to go
and see at least one show per week of the
Fringe](/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html).

PS: Sadly no photos. I wasn't sat in a great spot to take photos.
