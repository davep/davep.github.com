As I've mentioned a [few times on this blog](/tag/norton-guide.html), I've
long had a bit of a thing for [writing tools for reading the content of
Norton Guide files](https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/). I first used
Norton Guides back in the early 1990s thanks to the release of Clipper 5,
and later on in that decade I wrote my first couple of tools to turn guides
into HTML (and also write a Windows-based reader, then rewrote it, wrote one
for OS/2, wrote one for GNU/Linux, and so on).

One tool ([`ng2html`](https://github.com/davep/ng2html)) got used by a few
sites on the 'net to publish all sorts of guides, but it's not something I
ever got into doing myself. Amusingly, from time to time, because I had a
credit on those sites as the author of the conversion tool, I'd get random
emails from people hoping I could help them with the topic of whatever guide
they'd been reading. Sometimes I could help, often not.

From what I've recently been told two of the biggest sites for this sort of
thing (they might even have been the same site, or one a copy of the other,
I didn't really dive into them too much and wasn't sure who was behind them
anyway) have long since gone offline. This means that, as far as I can tell,
a huge collection of knowledge from the DOS days is a lot harder to get to,
if it hasn't disappeared altogether.

This makes me kind of sad.

So I had an idea: having [recently polished up my replacement for
ng2html](/2025/03/24/ng2web.html), why not use that to build my own site
that publishes the guides I have? So I set about it.

There's one wrinkle to this though. While the other sites seemed to just
publish every NG file they got their hands on, I'd prefer to try and do it
like this: publish every guide I have in my collection *that I have a
licence or permission to publish*; or as near as possible[^1]

Given all of this,
[norton-guides.davep.dev](https://norton-guides.davep.dev) has been born.
The repository that drives it [is on
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/norton-guides), and [I have a wiki
page](https://github.com/davep/norton-guides/wiki) that lists all the guides
I have that I could possibly publish, showing what I know about the
copyright/licence of each one and what the publishing state is.

So with this, I'm putting out a call for help: if you remember the days of
Norton Guide help files, if you have Norton Guide help files I don't have,
and especially if you are the copyright-holder of any of these files and you
can extend me the permission to open them up, or if you know the right
people and can get me in touch with them, DROP ME A LINE!

I'd also love to have others join me in this... quest. So if you want to
contribute to the repository and help build it up I'd also love to hear from
you.

[^1]: I will possibly be a little permissive when it comes to things that I
    believe contain public domain information to start with.
