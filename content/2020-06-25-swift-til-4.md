Some languages favour a ["one way to do
it"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) approach, some favour
["there's more than one way to do
it"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it).
I'm not sure I'm at a point where I have a feel for what Swift's approach
is, but I'm getting the impression it's more the latter than the former.

If there was one thing that made me think that, it was when I found out that
Swift's `bool` type has a `toggle` method.

```swift
var cool = false

print( cool )
cool = !cool
print( cool )
cool.toggle()
print( cool )
```

giving:

```sh
$ swift run
false
true
false
```

I can see a number of reasons why that's actually going to be handy -- the
main one being when you want to throw around a toggling method -- but it
still struck me as rather odd on first reading. I also think it's worth me
making a personal note about it because `foo.toggle()` isn't going to stand
out as much as `foo = !foo` when reading code. At least not for a short
while.
