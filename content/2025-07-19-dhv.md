Back in the very early days of my involvement with
[Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/), while looking for fun things to
build to test out the framework and find problems with it, I created
[`textual-astview`](https://github.com/davep/textual-astview). The idea was
pretty simple: exercise Textual's
[`Tree`](https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tree/) widget by using it to
display the output of Python's [abstract syntax tree
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html).

While the code still works, Textual has moved on a lot, as has my approach
to building applications with Textual, and so I've been wanting to do a
ground-up rewrite of it. At the same time I was also thinking that it might
be interesting to build a tool that provides other ways of understanding how
your Python source gets turned into runnable code; with this in mind I've
ended up building a terminal-based application called DHV.

The idea is pretty straightforward: you type in, paste in, or load up,
Python code, and you get a real-time display of what the [resulting
bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html) and abstract syntax
tree would be.

If you've ever wondered what a particular bit of code looks like under the
hood, or wondered if one particular approach to a problem is "more
efficient"[^1] than another, or just wondered to yourself if `1+1` ends up
being a complex operation or simply gets turned into `2`, this tool might be
useful to experiment and see.

As of now DHV only works with Python 3.13. The main reason for this is that
the Python `dis` module is a bit of a moving target and has had some
noticeable interface changes over the past few versions. When I find some
time I might work on making DHV a little more backward-compatible. But for
now keep this in mind: when you're looking at the results for some code
you're looking at what Python 3.13 (or later) would do, earlier Pythons may
differ.

DHV is licensed GPL-3.0 and available [via
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/dhv) and also [via
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dhv/). If you have an environment that has
`pipx` installed you should be able to get up and going with:

```sh
pipx install dhv
```

If you're a fan of
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and friends
you can install it like this:

```text
uv tool install --python 3.13 dhv
```

[^1]: I'm sure many of us have worked with that person who claims *"this is
    more efficient"* without providing any evidence; this might just be the
    tool to let you check that assertion.
