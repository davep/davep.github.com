It's Tuesday morning. That means it's the day after
[Virgin said they'd call me back to deal with the refund issue from last Friday](/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html).
I've not had a call back. That's the second time now I've been told they'll
call me back on a specific date and I've had nothing.

Right now I'm missing a callback about the refund *and* some sort of update
on the ticket wallet issue (which was promised "very soon"
[back on July 15th](/2016/07/29/virgin_east_coast_9.html)).

I'm also waiting for some sort of contact from another party in the
organisation that I was promised via DM on twitter last Friday. No sign of
that either (although no timescale was given for that).

It's starting to get a little tedious, always having to be the one to chase
things up.

But chase them up I will...
