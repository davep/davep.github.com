The run of writing new terminal-based tools that I want still keeps going.
First there was [Braindrop](/2025/01/03/braindrop.html), then there was
[Peplum](/2025/01/25/peplum.html), and now, released today, there's
[Hike](https://github.com/davep/hike).

Hike is yet another terminal-based Markdown browser. While it's far from the
first, and unlikely to be the last, it's mine and it looks and works exactly
how I need. Perhaps it'll be your sort of thing too?

This initial release has a bunch of handy features, including things like:

- A command line where file names, URLs and commands can be entered.
- A persistent history for the command line.
- A local file browser.
- A simple bookmarking system.
- A browsing history.
- Commands for quickly loading and viewing files held on GitHub, GitLab,
  Codeberg and Bitbucket.

As there's a lot to discover in the application, I've tried to make the help
screen as comprehensive as possible:

and there's also the command palette to help with discovering commands and
the keys that are associated with them:

Once again, themes are supported so no matter your taste you should find
something that's easy on your eyes:

Hike is licensed GPL-3.0 and available [via
GitHub](https://github.com/davep/hike) and also [via
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hike/). If you have an environment that has
`pipx` installed you should be able to get up and going with:

```sh
$ pipx install hike
```
It can also be installed with
`Homebrew` by tapping `davep/homebrew` and then installing `hike`:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install hike
```

Expect to see more updates in the near future; this is very much an ongoing
tinker project.
