In about a week's time I'll have had a GitHub account for 15 years! I can't
even remember what motivated me to create one now, but back in October 2008
I grabbed the `davep` account...

...and then made my [first repo](https://github.com/davep/dict.rb).

My use of the site after that was *very* sporadic. It looks like I'd add or
update something once or twice a year, but I wasn't a heavy user.

Then around the middle of 2015 I seem to have started using it a lot more.

This very much shows that during those years I was working on personal stuff
that I was making available in case anyone found it useful, but also leaning
heavily on GitHub as a (*a*, not *the*) place to keep backups of code I
cared about (or even no longer cared about). Quite a lot of that green will
likely be me having a few periods of [revamping my Emacs
configuration](/category/emacs.html).

The really fun part though starts about a year ago:

It's pretty obvious when I started working at Textualize, and working on a
FOSS project full time. This is, without a doubt, the most green my
contribution graph has looked. It looks like there's a couple of days this
year where I haven't visited my desk at all, and I think this is a good
thing (I try really hard to have a life outside of coding when it comes to
weekends), but I'm also delighted to see just how busy this year looks.

I really hope this carries on for a while to come.

Apparently, as of the time of writing, I've made 12,588 contributions that
are on GitHub. What's *really* fun is the fact that my first contribution
pre-dates my GitHub account by 9 years!

This one's pretty easy to explain: this is back from when I was involved
with
[Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_(programming_language)).
Back then we were using SourceForge to manage the project (as was the
fashion at the time), and at some point in the past whoever is maintaining
the project has pulled the full history into GitHub.

My [contribution history on
GitHub](/attachments/2023/10/01/contributions.png) is actually older than my
adult son. I suspect it's older than at least one person I work with. :-/ [^1]

[^1]: I'm imformed that this isn't the case[^2]; apparently I'm either bad at
    estimating people's ages, or bad at remembering them; or both.
[^2]: Although it's not *too* far off. :-/
