While I'm still [in blog-tinkering
mode](/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html) (long may it last!), I
thought it might be handy to keep a page kicking around that has links to
the small collection of "dot file" repositories I have.

Like many people, I keep these in a central location (in my case [up on
GitHub](https://github.com/davep)) so that I can very quickly spin up a
familiar work environment on a new machine (new machines are something that
doesn't happen *too* often, but it's always good to be able to get going
quickly when it does).

So, depending on browser type/size, either above here or off to the side,
there should now be a permanent link to [a page of links to those
repositories](/pages/dot-files.html).

As I look at it now it's actually surprising to me how much of my
"comfortable" environment is encapsulated in so few tools, and configured
with so few collections of files. There are other tools I use a lot too, but
most of them either have their own sync systems, or they have so few
configuration options (and are likely in a format that isn't easy to
grab/store) that it's not worth the bother.

This feels like a good thing, really.

One thing that's not amongst all of this, partly because it's not that
interesting, but also partly because the repository is private, is a single
bash script called `myenv`. On a new machine, once I've got enough of a
setup that I can clone from GitHub, I drag this down and run the script and
most of the rest of the environment follows.

It's quite satisfying when I need to use it.
