![Demo of textual-canvas](/attachments/2023/07/16/textual-canvas.png#centre)

Given that for a good chunk of this year I've been a bit lax about writing
here, there's a couple or so coding projects I've not written about (well,
not on *here* anyway -- I have spoken lots about them [over on
Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@davep)). One such project is
[`textual-canvas`](https://pypi.org/project/textual-canvas/).

As the name might suggest, it's a "canvas" for Textual applications, which
provides a pretty basic interface for drawing pixels, lines and circles --
and of course any other shape you are able to build up from those basics.

I've just [released a quick
update](https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/releases/tag/v0.2.0) after
it was [requested that I add a `clear` method to the `Canvas`
widget](https://github.com/davep/textual-canvas/discussions/1); a request
that makes perfect sense.
