I can't quite remember *where* I found this this week, I think it might have
been via a comment on some article on the [orange
site](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)[^1], but I stumbled on a really
handy bit of free (as in beer) software called [Quiche
Reader](https://quiche.works/reader/).

It's really simple and I feel *exactly* the sort of thing I need. Over the
years I've tried all sorts of "save to read later" tools and systems; be it
things like Pocket, or tools now built into the browser these days, even
adding URLs to [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) (back
when I used that) or (these days) Apple Reminders.

Nothing ever quite stuck. Normally I'd end up slapping stuff to read into
these systems and then never reading them.

Quiche Reader, so far, feels like the perfect approach.

It's quite simple: if I see something I want to read a bit later I save it
into the application (which will sync to my other devices via iCloud). Then,
when I go to Quiche Reader, I *have* to read the article or delete it and
move on. This is sort of what I'd do anyway, saving stuff up for months on
end until one day I'd declare saved reading bankruptcy and then start the
whole cycle again.

Now I can look at the saved article stack and I'm forced to either read the
thing, or be honest with myself that if I'm not gonna read it now, I'm
probably never going to.

It does have a "pause" facility (or something like that, I forget the name)
where you can throw an article to the back of the queue; but even then that
means it'll keep popping back to the top again.

I'll see how it goes; but so far I feel like this is the best *"I'll save
this to read later"* tool I've found yet.

[^1]: I know, I KNOW! But there's so few places left to aimlessly scroll on
    the bus now!
