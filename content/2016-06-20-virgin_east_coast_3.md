Another update to the saga of trying to get the Virgin East Coast Ticket
Wallet app up and running.

Late on yesterday afternoon (a Sunday, it has to be said, so that's some
dedication to solving the problem) I got a reply to
[the email I'd sent them previously](http://blog.davep.org/2016/06/18/virgin_east_coast_2.html). It
didn't contain anything in response to what I'd written (so it looks like
I'm never going to find out what a TOC is! *sadface*) but it did say this:

> To Dave Pearson,

I'll admit that I wasn't convinced by this plan. There was no explanation as
to why I'd want to change my password, or why I'd want to pretend that I'd
forgotten my password (I hadn't forgotten it, obviously), there wasn't a
suggestion that something had been changed or fixed such that this would
tickle a solution into working. It appeared to imply that I'd actually
forgotten my password and that I should go about setting it again.

Fair enough... I did. It didn't make a jot of difference. Same problem. I've
written back to say so.

The actual act of saying I'd forgotten my password was a little odd. I did
the obvious thing of going to the
[main website](https://www.virgintrainseastcoast.com/) and saying I wanted
to sign in.

Once clicked, that took me to the actual login page, which has the link to
say you've forgotten your password.

When you click on that link you get taken to.... a login page!

There you then have to say, again, that you've forgotten your password. Only
once you've done that do you get somewhere where you can say you've actually
forgotten your password.

Not horrific, of course, but a rather odd route, needing to click pretty
much the same link twice to say the same thing.

Anyway, I tried it, it didn't work, they've had an email to say as much. Now
I wait for the next step.
