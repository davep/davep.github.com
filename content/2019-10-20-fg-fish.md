These days [fish](https://fishshell.com/) is my shell of choice. I started
out with [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) back in the 1990s, went
through a bit of a
[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)/[oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) phase, but
earlier this year finally settled on fish.

At some point I might write a post about my fish config, and why fish works
well for me. But that's an idea for another time.

In this post I thought I'd share a little snippet of code that can come in
handy now and again.

Sometimes I find myself inside a git repo, in the shell, and I want to get
to the "[forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29)" for
that repo. This is most often either on [GitHub](https://github.com/), or in
a [company-local installation of GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).
To get there quickly I wrote
[`gh.fish`](https://gist.github.com/davep/3bac3b30e45a3560c265150e609219db):

```
##############################################################################
# Attempt go visit the origin hub for the current repo.

function gh -d "Visit the repo in its origin hub"

    # Check that there is some sort of origin.
    set origin (git config --get remote.origin.url)

    # If we didn't get anything...
    if not test "$origin"
        # ...complain and exit.
        echo "This doesn't appear to be a git repo with an origin"
        return 1
    end

    # Open in the browser.
    open "https://"(string replace ":" "/" (string replace -r '\.git$' "" (string split "@" $origin)[ 2 ]))

end

### gh.fish ends here
```

The idea is pretty simple: I see if the repo has an origin of some
description and, if it has, I [slice and dice
it](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#string) into something
that looks like the URL you'd expect to find for a GitHub or GitLab repo.
Finally I use
[`open`](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#open) to open the
URL in the environment's browser of choice.
