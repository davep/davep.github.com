[Following on](/2020/06/22/swift-til-1.html) with writing little notes to
myself so I remember some key things as I learn about Swift...

I sort of feel like this will make reading code a little harder, so it's one
I want to keep in mind. When calling an instance method, if it's not
ambiguous, you can omit `self.` from the call. For example:

```swift
class Foo {
    private func inner() -> String { "Foo" }
    func outer() -> String { inner() + self.inner() }
}

print( Foo().outer() )
```

This makes me feel a little uneasy, and I strongly suspect I'll always use
`self.` when writing such code: I'm a big fan of the idea that we write code
for people, not for compilers.
