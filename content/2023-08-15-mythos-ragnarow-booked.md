That's a third show booked! This means that, [as I
hoped](/2023/08/07/off-to-see-nick-harper.html#off-to-see-nick-harper), I'm
going to manage at least one show a week for the Fringe!

Now, this one could be seen as a cheat, sorta, kinda. I've seen this show
before. But I liked it so much last year I *have* to see it again! The odd
thing about it was it's not something I would have gone for on my own, it's
technically not really my thing, but I got talked into it and I'm so glad I
was!

So a year back [MariÃ«lle](https://artisan.chat/@supermarielle) told me about
this wrestling show at the Fringe and how she wanted to go but nobody else
was interested and I was all *"yebbut wrestling though?"* and didn't think
much more about it. Eventually though, after some persuasion (I mean, an
hour or so at a show and some beers afterwards, how bad could it be
really?), I agreed to go. I expected to find it meh.

Holy shit was it so much fun! Like, [seriously so much
fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37r1CqMKLzM). I'd never realised that
wrestling was the best way to tell the tales from Norse mythology; turns out
that wrestling is absolutely the best way to tell the tales from Norse
mythology.

So [we're off back again this
year](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mythos-ragnarok). All booked,
not this weekend, the weekend after.

There might even be a beer afterwards. Perhaps not *quite* so many as last
year though.
