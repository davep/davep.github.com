For anyone who doesn't know, today is the day for [EmacsConf
2019](https://emacsconf.org/2019/). As you might gather from the name, it's
a conference all about Emacs, the joys of Emacs, Emacs Lisp and other
Emacs-related things.

Better still, it's an online conference (although there do appear to be a
couple of related physical gatherings around the world).

I've got snacks and drinks in and no plans for my Saturday, and I hope to
follow the whole thing from start to finish.

If Emacs is your thing, or knowing more about Emacs is your thing, be sure
to check it out!
