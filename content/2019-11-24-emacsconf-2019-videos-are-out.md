At the start of this month [I spent a very enjoyable Saturday afternoon
watching EmacsConf 2019](/2019/11/02/emacsconf-2019.html). If you missed it,
or even if you didn't, you might like to know that [the announcement has
gone out](https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacsconf-discuss/2019-11/msg00002.html)
that almost all of the videos are [now available for
watching](https://emacsconf.org/2019/videos).

While I mean nothing negative about any other video, I think the two that
stand out the most for me, in terms of things that grabbed my interest, were
[*How a Completely Blind Manager/Dev Uses Emacs Every
Day*](https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/08.html) and [*Emacs as my Go To
Script Language*](https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/15.html).

I seem to recall that both those talks were hit with technical issues (many
talks on the day were -- part of the enjoyment for me was how the whole
conference was an experiment in using Free Software to host the whole
thing), but they're well worth a watch despite this.

If you have any sort of interest in Emacs I'd highly recommend dipping into
the whole collection.

I really hope there's going to be a 2020 EmacsConf.
