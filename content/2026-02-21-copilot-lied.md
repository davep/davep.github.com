This morning, with [my experiment with
Copilot](/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html) having settled down a
little bit, I thought I might try and use the result for another little
experiment. For a long time now I've maintained a (currently lapsed)
photoblog. It was always very much tied to *"the site formerly known as
twitter"* and, since I fully erased my account after the site turned into a
[Nazi bar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar), I've not done anything
to update how it gets populated.

So I got to thinking: I have a full backup of all the images in a couple of
places; perhaps with a bit of coding (and some help from "the AIs") I can
revive it using [BlogMore](https://blogmore.davep.dev)?

I tinkered for a wee bit and mostly got something going (albeit I'm going to
have to do some work to back-port the actual dates and times of some earlier
images, and there's a load of work to do to somehow pull out all the tags).
But then I hit a small hitch.

When building BlogMore I made the decision to let it write both the code
*and* the documentation. It documented a couple of features I never asked
for, but which seemed sensible so I never questioned. On the other hand
neither did I test them at the time (because they weren't important to what
I needed).

It's the exact reason I added this warning at the start of the
documentation:

> [!warning]
> BlogMore is an experiment in using GitHub Copilot to develop a whole
> project from start to finish. As such, almost every part of this
> documentation was generated by Copilot and what it knows about the
> project. Please keep this in mind.
>
> From what I can see at the moment the documentation is broadly correct,
> and I will update and correct it as I work through it and check it myself.
> Of course, I will welcome reports of problems or fixes.

With this warning in mind, and with the intention of working through the
documentation and testing its claims, I decided to test out one of the
features when building up the new photoblog.

Whereas with this blog I keep all the posts [in a flat
structure](https://github.com/davep/davep.github.com/tree/main/content),
this time around I thought I'd try out this (taken from the
Copilot-generated BlogMore documentation):

BlogMore is flexible about how you organise your posts. Here are some common patterns:

**Flat structure** (all posts in one directory):
```
posts/
  ├── hello-world.md
  ├── python-tips.md
  └── web-development.md
```

**Note:** Files can be date-prefixed (e.g., `2026-02-18-hello-world.md`) and BlogMore will automatically remove the date prefix from the URL slug. The post will still use the `date` field from frontmatter for chronological ordering.

**Organised by date**:
```
posts/
  ├── 2024/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   │   └── hello-world.md
  │   └── 02/
  │       └── python-tips.md
  └── 2025/
      └── 01/
          └── web-development.md
```

**Organised by topic**:
```
posts/
  ├── python/
  │   ├── decorators.md
  │   └── type-hints.md
  └── web/
      ├── css-grid.md
      └── javascript-tips.md
```

Using the hierarchy approach, especially with dates, seemed ideal! I'd drop
the actual images in such a hierarchy, and also drop the Markdown posts in a
parallel hierarchy too. Perfect!

So I set it all up to do that, fired up `blogmore serve`, visited the URL
and... `No posts yet`. What the hell?

So I checked the code for BlogMore and, sure enough, despite the fact the
documentation was selling me on this handy way to organise my posts, no such
feature existed!

As an experiment [I then asked Copilot what the heck was going
on](https://github.com/davep/blogmore/issues/129). Much as I expected,
rather than coming back with an answer to the question, [it went right ahead
and fixed it instead](https://github.com/davep/blogmore/pull/130). Which is
fine, that's where I would have taken this, but I do wish it would answer
the question first.

So, yeah, unsurprisingly Copilot flat out lied[^1] in the documentation. I'm
not in the least bit shocked by this and, as I said, I fully expected this.
But it was amusing to have an example of this turn up so early in the
documentation, in such a glaring way, and in a way that was so easily fixed
(really, it was just a swap of
[`Path.glob`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob)
to
[`Path.rglob`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob)).

As I play with this more it's going to be fun to see what other bold claims
turn out to not be true; or perhaps even the reverse: what neat features
lurk in the code that haven't been documented.

[^1]: Yes, as I mentioned yesterday, that's an anthropomorphism. Folk who
    take such things as an indication that you don't understand "AI" might
    want to think about what it is to be a human when communicating.
