For [about 2 and a half years
now](/2023/07/05/the-switch-has-been-made.html) this blog has been built
with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com). For the most part I've enjoyed using
it, it's been easy enough to work with, although not exciting to work with
(which I think is a positive thing to say about a static site generator).

There were, however, a couple or so things I didn't like about the layout I
was getting out of it. One issue was the archive, which was a pretty boring
list of titles of all the posts on the site. It would have been nice to have
them broken down by date or something, at least.

Of course, there are lots of themes, and it also uses templates, so I could
probably have tweaked it "just so"; but every time I started to look into it
I found myself wanting to "fix" the issue by building my own engine from
scratch.

Thankfully, every time that happened, I'd come to my senses and go off and
work on some other fun personal project. Until earlier this week, that was.

The thing is... I've been looking for a project where I could dive into the
world of "AI coding" and "Agents" and all that nonsense. Not because I want
to abandon the absolute thrill and joy I still get from writing actual code
as a human, but because I want to understand things from the point of view
of people who champion these tools.

The only way I'm going to have an informed opinion is to get informed; the
only way to get informed is to try this stuff out.

So, here I am, with my blog now migrated over to
[BlogMore](https://blogmore.davep.dev); a project that gives me a
blog-focused static site generator that I 100% drove the development of, but
for which I wrote almost none of the code.

At the moment it's working out well, as a generator. I'm happy with how it
works, I'm happy with what it generates. I also think it's 100%
backwards-compatible when it comes to URLs and feeds and so on. If you do
see anything odd happening, if you do see anything that looks broken, [I'd
love to hear about
it](https://github.com/davep/blogmore/discussions/categories/q-a).

As for this being a "100% AI" project, and how I found that process and how
I feel about the implications and the results... [that's a blog post to
come](/2026/02/20/five-days-with-copilot.html).

I took lots of notes.
