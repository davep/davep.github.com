This is actually the second release of OSHit since [I first announced it a
week back](/2024/01/01/oshit.html), and I'll get to that other release in a
moment.

I've just published v0.2.0, which isn't a very substantial release, but
which bumps the required version of Textual to
[v0.47.1](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.1) and
has some fun with [the new nested CSS
feature](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v0.47.0).

Underlying the point of this release was me taking a *"real world"*
application of mine and nesting as much of the CSS within it as possible, in
part to get a feel for how and when it's useful, but also to give it a
proper test in a *"proper"* application. In doing so [I think I've found one
bug](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/3969).

Dogfooding is always a good idea.

The main visible change in this release is I've played around with the look
of the comments dialog a bit:

![OSHit you have comments](/attachments/2024/01/07/oshit-comments.png)

I'm still narrowing this down, but I think I prefer this look to what I
started out with.

Another change I made was also to the comments dialog. Before, if you
performed the *"expand comments"* action on a comment card that already had
its comments expanded, it would move focus to the first child comment; this
was a deliberate choice that felt right at the time. Having used the app for
a few days now I've realised that making it an open/close toggle is far more
useful. So that's what I've done.

Now... as for [the previous
release](https://github.com/davep/oshit/releases/tag/v0.1.1) I mentioned
above. That was a fun one.

Back when I released v0.1.0 some joker decided that it would be fun to
[submit the blog post about it to the Orange
Site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38831083). The comments there
went as you'd expected:

- Some riffed off the opening paragraph, ignoring the tool itself.
- Some riffed off the opening paragraph in self-reflective way.
- Some riffed off the opening paragraph in a *"I never see the problem"*
  way.
- One or two did the usual *"why even bother building that when
  `$TOOL_OF_CHOICE` exists?"* dance to show their terminal purity.
- One or two posted genuinely useful links to other similar projects.
- The biggest tree of comments was kind of a fight.

One comment caught my eye though; someone reported having a problem running
it. My initial thought on reading it was *"my dude, seriously, you're going
to report the problem in some random comment on HN rather than raise an
issue with the author?!?"*.

For once [I was wrong to be so cynical](https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues/2).

So, yeah, that was the reminder I needed that I'd been intentionally
reckless while writing the original code, and hadn't [gone back to the API
code I'd written and made it behave](https://github.com/davep/oshit/pull/4)
before doing the initial release.

All of which is to say: if you run into a problem with some FOSS project, be
like [@mihaitodor](https://github.com/mihaitodor). Issue that thing so the
developer gets to know about it; don't assume they'll be reading some random
comment section, social media site or Discord server!

That and don't make 500+ HTTP requests at once; that might not end well for
some.
