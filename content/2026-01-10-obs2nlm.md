I'm sure I've mentioned a couple of times before that I've become quite the
fan of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). For the past few years, at any given
point, I've had a couple of vaults on the go. Generally I find such vaults a
really useful place to record things I'd otherwise forget, and of course as
a place to go back and look things up.

But... even then, it's easy enough to forget what you might have recorded
and know that you can even go back and look things up. Also I tend to find
that I can't quite figure out a good way of getting a good overview of what
I've recorded, over time.

Meanwhile: I've been playing around with Google's
[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) as a tool to help research and
understand various topics. After doing this with my recent winter break
coding project (more on that in the future) I realised I really should get
serious about taking this approach with my Obsidian Vaults.

I'm sure this is far from novel, I'm sure lots of people have done similar
things already; in fact I'd quickly dabbled with the idea [a few months
ago](https://github.com/davep/vault2source), had a bit of a laugh at some of
the things the "studio" made of a vault, and promptly forgot about it.

This time though I got to thinking that I should try and take it a little
more seriously.

And so [obs2nlm](https://obs2nlm.davep.dev) was born.

The idea is simple enough: enumerate all the Markdown files in the vault,
wrap them in boundary markers, add some instructions to the start of the
file to help NotebookLM "comprehend" the content better, throw in a table of
contents to give clues to the structure of the vault, and see what happens
when you use the resulting file as a source.

So far it's actually turning out to be really helpful. I've been using it to
get summaries regarding my work over the past 18 months or so and it's
helped me to consolidate my thoughts on all sorts of issues and subjects.

It's not perfect, however. I've had it "hallucinate" some stuff when making
things in the studio (most notably in the slide deck facility); for me
though I find this an acceptable use of an LLM. I *know* the subject it's
talking to me about and I know when it's making stuff up. This, in turn,
makes for a useful lesson in how and when to not trust the output of a tool
like this.

Having tested it out with a currently-active vault, I'm now interested to
find out what it'll make of some of the archived vaults I have. Back in 2024
[I wrote a couple or so tools for making vaults from other
things](/2024/11/04/markdown-all-the-things.html) and so I have a vault of a
journal I kept in [Journey](https://journey.cloud) for a number of years, a
vault of a journal I'd kept before then in [Evernote](https://evernote.com),
and I also have a vault of all the tweets I wrote before I abandoned
Twitter. I also have a vault that was dedicated to recording the daily
events and thoughts of my time working at
[Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/). It's going to be fun seeing what
NotebookLM makes of each of those; especially the last one.

Anyway, if Obsidian is your thing, and if you are dabbling with or fancy
dabbling with NotebookLM, perhaps
[obs2nlm](https://github.com/davep/obs2nlm) will be handy for you.
