The other day I stumbled on a tip about Evernote. It
was
[a snippet of information in a bigger post on the Evernote blog](https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/10/28/one-student-made-productivity-habit/)
so I saved it to Evernote (obviously) to take a look at later.

The tip was that Ctrl-Cmd-B in Evernote (on the Mac) will format a body of
text as source code. While I'm not in the habit of using Evernote to store
code, not even snippets of code (that's something far better served
by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)), it seemed like something worth
committing to memory.

This morning, while finally in front of a suitable machine, I took a look.
Sure enough, there's the menu option.

Handy! So I created a test note with some code in it so that I could see how
it formatted it. I was curious to see if it just did simple fixed text or if
it offered options to highlight various languages (I didn't hold out much
hope for the latter, but it was worth a look).

That's when it got odd.

After I created a note and went to format some code, the menu option
disappeared!

From what I can tell, once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. At
least, not until you actually close down Evernote and start it up again.

Frustratingly, none of this is the case in the Windows version. While the
key combination is different there, the menu option is available and stays
available.

The version of Evernote I have (on my iMac and my Macbook) is 6.9.2. The
version number on Windows is 6.4.2 (after checking for updates -- I'm going
to guess that the Mac and Windows version numbers don't match on purpose).

Goodness knows what's going on here. All I can imagine is that it has
something to do
with
[a thread I found on Evernote's support forum](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/97731-code-block-in-evernote-for-mac/) that
suggests that code block formatting is some sort of test/beta feature and
can only be enabled via a settings option that *isn't* available via the
version downloaded from the Apple App Store.

So, at some point, I guess I'm going to have to uninstall Evernote from the
Macbook and the iMac, reinstall from the Evernote website itself, and try
this again. All of which seems a bit silly when *the menu option is there
and visible when I run Evernote up!*

**Edit to add:** Sure enough, removing the App Store version and installing
the version from Evernote's own website, and *then* going into preferences
and enabling the option, sorted it. It's still really odd they'd promote the
facility via the blog and not mention it, and also very odd that the option
would always show until the first time you're in a position to use it, and
then it'd disappear.
