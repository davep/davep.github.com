I honestly can't remember when I was first introduced to the idea of
RSS/Atom feeds, and the idea of having an aggregator or reader of some
description to keep up with updates on your favourite sites. It's got to be
over 20 years ago now. I can't remember what I used either, but I remember
using one or two readers that ran locally, right up until I met [Google
Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader). Once I discovered that
I was settled.

As time moved on and I moved from platform to platform, and wandered into
the smartphone era, I stuck with Google Reader (and the odd client for it
here and there). It was a natural and sensible approach to consuming news
and updates. It also mostly felt like a solved problem and so felt nice and
stable.

So, of course, I was annoyed when Google killed it off, [like so many useful
things](https://killedbygoogle.com).

When this happened I dabbled with a couple of alternatives and, at some
point, finally settled on [TheOldReader](https://theoldreader.com). Since
then it's been my "server" for feed subscriptions with me using desktop and
mobile clients to work against it.

But... I never found anything that worked for me that ran in the terminal.
Given [I've got a thing for writing terminal-based
tools](/tag/terminal.html) it made sense I should have a go, and so
[OldNews](https://github.com/davep/oldnews) became my winter break project.

I've written it as a client application for [the API of
TheOldReader](https://github.com/theoldreader/api), and only for that, and
have developed it in a way that works well for me. All the functionality I
want and need is in there:

- Add subscriptions
- Rename subscriptions
- Remove subscriptions
- Add folders
- Rename folders
- Remove folders
- Move subscriptions between folders
- Mark read/unread
- Read articles (that provide actual content in their feeds)

Currently there's no support for starring feeds or interacting with the
whole "friend" system (honestly: while I see mention of it in the API, I
know nothing of that side of things and really don't care about it). As time
goes on I might work on that.

As with all of my other terminal-based applications, there's a rich command
palette that shows you what you can do, and also what keyboard shortcuts
will run those commands. While I do still need to work on some documentation
for the application (although you'd hope that anyone looking for an RSS
reader at this point would mostly be able to find their way around) the
palette is a good place to go looking for things you can do.

Plus there's a help screen too.

If themes are your thing, there's themes:

![Textual Light](/attachments/2026/02/11/textual-light.png)
![Nord](/attachments/2026/02/11/nord.png)

That's a small selection, and there's more to explore.

Also on the cosmetic front there's a simple compact mode, which toggles
between two ways of showing the navigation menu, the article lists and the
panel headers.

OldNews has been a daily-driver for a wee while now, while also under active
development. I think I've covered all the main functions I want and have
also shaken out plenty of bugs, so today's the day to call it v1.0.0 and go
from there.

If you're a user of TheOldReader and fancy interacting with it from the
terminal too then it's out there to try out. It's licensed GPL-3.0 and
available [via GitHub](https://github.com/davep/oldnews) and also [via
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/oldnews/). If you have an environment that
has `pipx` installed you should be able to get up and running with:

```sh
$ pipx install oldnews
```

It can also be installed using
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```sh
uv tool install oldnews
```

If you don't have `uv` installed you can use [uvx.sh](https://uvx.sh) to
perform the installation. For GNU/Linux or macOS or similar:

```sh
curl -LsSf uvx.sh/oldnews/install.sh | sh
```

or on Windows:

```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://uvx.sh/oldnews/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Once installed, run the `oldnews` command.

Hopefully this is useful to someone else; meanwhile I'll be using it more
and more. If you need help, or have any ideas, please feel free to [raise an
issue](https://github.com/davep/oldnews/issues) or [start a
discussion](https://github.com/davep/oldnews/discussions).
