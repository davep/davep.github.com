        </div>
        
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Both at work and at home I use Emacs by <a href="https://github.com/davep/longmacs.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keeping a copy running all the
time</a>, and use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>emacsclient</code> to open
files inside
it</a>
(including on remote machines thanks to a bit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ssh</code></a> and heavy use of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>tramp</code></a> -- I might write this up at
some point). This works really well, but does mean I tend to build up a lot
of buffers over time.</p>
<p>Having lots of buffers open isn't generally an issue, and if I'm working on
lots of different files in a project during the course of a hacking session
it's actually a good thing. But, quite often, I want to tidy up the buffer
list, clearing it back to near-zero buffers open. Many years ago, when I had
a "proper" tower system running 24/7, with Emacs open all the time, I'd use
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MidnightMode" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>clean-buffer-list</code> as part of
<code>midnight</code></a>. Along the way
that fell out of favour with me, likely because I drifted into using
machines that had Emacs open all the time but where the machine wasn't awake
all the time.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to have some fun rolling my own solution, and
<a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>nuke-buffers</code></a> was born.</p>
<p>Rather than try and do things in an automated way, this was designed to be
<a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/ffc863ca0fb669d2f6639bda62e81764c35767ce/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L98-L107" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bound to a key (or
two)</a>
and then be run when I wanted, being as harsh as possible about cleaning up
the buffer list. Since first writing it it's worked well for me.</p>
<p>These days I tend to let the buffer list build up as I work on a new
feature, or chase down a bug, etc. Then, once I've made the final commit for
that period of focus, I'll hit the <code>nuke-buffer</code> key combo as the final act
of confirming that I've done the job. So not only does this help tidy my
Emacs session a bit, it also feels like a physical form of punctuation --
back in less sensible days, when I had some terrible habits, it would have
been when I'd reach for the celebratory cigarette; buffer-tidying feels far
more wholesome. ;)</p>
<p>The way the code works is, of course, mostly directed at how I work -- it's
highly likely it wouldn't make sense for many other people. The main aim is
to kill as many buffers as possible, but without disturbing anything else.
The list of buffers it gathers for nuking avoids buffers that are <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L60-L62" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visiting

(obviously), avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L56" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">any "special"

and also avoids <a href="https://github.com/davep/nuke-buffers.el/blob/d018499b78968f074565c076068f657a1631aa07/nuke-buffers.el#L58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">any buffer in a list of names to
avoid</a>.</p>
<p>I've being using this on a daily basis for around 2.5 years now and it's
done the job without ever losing me any work.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>At the start of this year, as part of a much bigger process to review the
work that had taken place over the previous 12 months, I was asked (at work)
to provide some information about how much time I'd spent on various
projects. Now, for me, there's really only one project, but there's lots of
different tools and libraries that I've written to support the main work I
do. All of these are split into different repositories in the
company-internal instance of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitLab</a>. This meant
that getting a rough idea of what I was working on and when would be easy
enough -- it's all there in the commit history.</p>
<p>Given that this information would make up a couple of slides at most during
a far bigger presentation, I wanted something that would be snappy and easy
for non-developers to follow and understand. I spent a bit of time pondering
some options and decided that (ab)using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gantt
chart</a> layout would make sense.</p>
<p>That choice was made all the more easier given that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#mermaid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitLab
supports</a> the use of
<a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mermaid charts</a> within its
Markdown. This meant I could quickly write some code that took the git log
of each repository, turned it into mermaid code, and then render it (by
hand, this was all about getting things done quickly) via GitLab.</p>
<p>This sounded like it could be a fun personal project. The result was some
Python code called <a href="https://github.com/davep/git2gantt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">git2gantt</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the output isn't anything too clever, it's just code
that can be used to create a plot via mermaid. For example, running
git2gannt over itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>gantt
  title git2gantt output
  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

  section git2gantt
  Development: devgit2gantt20190208, 2019-02-08, 2019-02-13
  Development: devgit2gantt20190214, 2019-02-14, 2019-02-15
  Development: devgit2gantt20190303, 2019-03-03, 2019-03-04
  Development: devgit2gantt20191203, 2019-12-03, 2019-12-04
</code></pre></div>

<p>Usage is pretty straightforward: <img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at
13.18.12.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.18.12.png" />
As you can see, it can be run over multiple repos at once, and there's also
an option to have it consider every branch within each repository. Another
handy option is the ability to limit the output to just one author --
perhaps you just want to document what you've done on a repo, not the
contributions of other people.</p>
<p>Also especially handy, if you don't want to bore people with too much
detail, is the "fuzz" option. This lets you tell <code>git2gannt</code> how relaxed you
want it to be when it tries to decide how long a run of work on a repo
lasted. So, perhaps, you're working on and off on a library that supports
some other system you're documenting, but you might only be making changes
every other day or so. With the correct fuzz value you can make it clear you
were working <em>on</em> the library for a couple of weeks, despite there only
being a commit every other day.</p>
<p>An example of running the output over a handful of projects would look
something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png" src="/attachments/2019/12/08/Screenshot 2019-12-08 at 13.34.41.png#centre" /></p>
<p>This is one of those tools I knocked up quickly to get a job done, and
haven't quite got round to finishing off fully. One thing I'd really like to
do is add mermaid support directly within it, so that it actually has the
option to emit plots, not just mermaid code (or, perhaps, drop the mermaid
approach and use something else entirely).</p>
<p>Meanwhile though, if you're looking for something quick and dirty that will
help you visualise what you've been working on and when for a good period of
time... perhaps this will help.</p>

            <p>While it does seem that they're a little out of fashion these days, in some
circles anyway, I'm still an avid fan of <code>make</code> and make files. Even in
environments where I don't need a <code>Makefile</code> to actually build anything,
I'll use one (or more) to help create handy shortcuts for getting stuff
done.</p>
<p>Looking at the main <code>Makefile</code> for one of my major work projects, there's 45
targets that help fire off various jobs (all of them <a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">self-documenting using
a variation on an approach I read a while
back</a>).</p>
<p>In most cases the targets aren't real targets. That's to say, they don't
build the thing they're called. They are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">phony
targets</a>.
So, as makes sense, I make a point of marking them all as such. I follow the
convention that has the <code>.PHONY</code> marker appear on the line before the
target; this feels cleaner to me and easier to follow and maintain.</p>
<p>But.... I'm lazy. And I use Emacs. Typing out <code>.PHONY foo</code> all the time
feels like far too much work. So, some time ago, I quickly threw together
<a href="https://github.com/davep/make-phony.el" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>make-phony.el</code></a>.</p>
<p>With this I could be <em>really</em> lazy. I could type out the <code>Makefile</code> target
and then, with my cursor on it, press a key combination and have the
<code>.PHONY</code> marker put in place.</p>
<p>Does it save much time? Yeah, probably not really. But it was a fun little
exercise and an excuse to write a little bit of Emacs Lisp.</p>
<p>There's one thing I made a point of doing in the heart of this too: using
<code>rx</code>. For anyone who doesn't know of it, think of it as a very Lispy way of
writing regular expressions. I won't even try and explain it all here
<a href="http://francismurillo.github.io/2017-03-30-Exploring-Emacs-rx-Macro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">because others have done an excellent job
already</a>.
What I will do is say this: if you're in the habit of writing some Emacs
Lisp, or even tinkering with your configuration, and you find yourself
writing a regular expression, consider looking at <code>rx</code> -- it's well worth
the time to get to know it.</p>
<p>Slowly, as time goes on, I'm weeding out "vanilla" regular expressions from
my config and code and moving over to using <code>rx</code>. I feel, quite rightly I
think, that <a href="https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/b3185a1dbaa0a16f540465844b84c5e1c6a77180/init.d/packages/init-packages-melpa.el#L117-L126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">something like
this</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rx</span>
<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">or</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; Ignore hidden files.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">bol</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; I never want to edit the desktop.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Desktop/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">;; Ignore compiled files.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">or</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;pyc&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;elc&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">group</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;.egg-info/&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">eol</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is much easier to write, read and maintain, than this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;\\(^\\.\\)\\|\\(Desktop/$\\)\\|\\(\\.\\(?:\\(?:\\(?:el\\|py\\)c\\)\\)$\\)\\|\\(\\.egg-info/$\\)&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>I mean, even <em>if</em> the regular expression above can be written in a more
efficient way (and I imagine it can), as someone working in a Lisp
environment, I'd much sooner write and work with the <code>rx</code> version.</p>
