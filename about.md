After a long time away from it, and mostly with an emphasis on natting about
things on places like [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+DavePearson/posts),
I'm finally having a crack at a return to blogging.

This site won't be anything terribly interesting, just somewhere where I can
ramble on about coding, things I'm experimenting with, and assorted nonsense.
It also serves as a vehicle for me to get back into constantly using
things like Markdown, ruby, HTML and JavaScript for my own fun.
