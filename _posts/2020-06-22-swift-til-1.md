As [I mentioned
yesterday](/2020/06/21/a-second-attempt-to-learn-swift.html),
I'm going to make a small series of posts where I write down things that
I've stumbled on while getting to know Swift that are, for me personally,
worthy of note, different, unusual, cool, or just simply "WTF!?!".

Because learning new stuff is fun.

My first one is that you can use keywords as identifiers if you "escape"
them with backticks. Kind of like this:

```swift
let `let` = "let"

print( `let` )
```

I'm struggling to imagine a situation where I'd ever want to do this. I'm
still unsure if my reaction is "that's cool" or "WTF?!?".
