It's been over a week now
[since I last had contact with customer services](/2016/06/28/virgin_east_coast_5.html)
and there's still been no word. So, earlier today, I sent off an email.
Short and sweet, requesting that I possibly get an answer to the questions
I'd asked them:

> Hi, it's over a week now since I answered the couple of questions you

Later on in the day I got a reply:

At this point I'm starting to seriously consider the idea that I'm being
trolled. To start with, there's this bit:

> concerning the tickets that you have not booked with us yet

It's hard not to read that as sarcasm. Any way I look at it it comes across
as sarcasm. Sure, of course I've not booked any tickets direct with them
(although I have booked lots of tickets with them this year via other
websites) because of the issue -- that's the damn issue!

Anyway, possible over-sensitivity on my part aside...

The reply *still* seems to think that the problem is that I'm not seeing
tickets I've not booked inside the Ticket Wallet app. That isn't the
problem. The problem, as I clearly stated from the very start, is that I
can't even log into the app. I. CAN'T. LOG. IN!

I've said this plenty of times. I've made it very clear that this is the
problem. And still I'm being asked:

> please confirm what page you get to in the ticket wallet app

I'm really wondering what part of "I can't even log into the app" is so hard
to understand.

On the other hand, at least I've now got my second confirmation of the fact
that I do actually have an account on their website, after being told I
don't. I suppose that's something.

Meanwhile.... the Ticket Wallet app is
[*still*](/2016/06/17/virgin_east_coast.html) telling me that my user name
or password are incorrect.

PS: "Thank you for your email dated 6th June 2016" -- it's July, not June.
