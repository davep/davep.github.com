This post is *very* much a case of me writing it down to try and get it all
straight in my head, and to make sure it sticks. The other day I was reading
about Swift's types and type-equality checks, and as I'd expect from plenty
of other languages I've worked with, there's a way for checking that two
types are the same, such that super/subclasses aren't taken into account,
and a way where they are. So, given this silly code:

```swift
class Animal {}

class Cat : Animal {}

print( Cat.self == Animal.self )          // False
print( Cat.self is Animal.Type )          // True
print( type( of: Cat() ) is Animal.Type ) // True
```

it's made clear that `==` checks for strict equality and a super/subclass
relationship isn't taken into account. On the other hand `is` does take it
into account.

Only... what's with this whole `.self` sometimes and `.Type` other times
business? That took a little bit of writing code and playing to get
comfortable with. Here's how I understand it now (and do feel free to
correct me below if I'm way off):

Given the above code, `Animal.Type` is the type of a value that expresses
the type of `Animal`. On the other hand, `Animal.self` is a value that is
the type of an `Animal`. Yeah, I know, that still reads oddly. But written
as code:

```swift
let feline : Cat.Type = Cat.self
```

I think it makes a lot more sense. And having got there I felt I better
understood it. I'm not 100% sure I'm 100% with it, but I'm getting there.
