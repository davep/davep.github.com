`gh.fish`, which [I wrote about yesterday](/2019/10/20/fg-fish.html),
actually sprang from something I initially wrote for Emacs. I'm often
spending my time switching between Emacs and the command line (which is fast
and easy -- I normally work on macOS and have Emacs and
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) running full screen, and I can switch
between them without ever taking my hands off the keyboard), so it makes
sense to have some handy commands repeated in both places.

So, originally, I'd written
[`gitweb.el`](https://github.com/davep/gitweb.el) to open the current repo's
"forge" in the web browser.

As with the fish version, how it works is quite simple. I use
[`shell-command-to-string`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Synchronous-Processes.html)
to call git and find the origin URL for the current repo, and then
manipulate it a bit to turn it into a normal browser-friendly URL. Finally,
if I get something workable, I use
[`browser-url`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Browse_002dURL.html)
to have the resulting page open in the browsing environment of choice.

I have the command [bound to a key combination that's similar to the ones I
use with magit and
forge](https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d/blob/8f1be3a03e4be98155571939fe5d6fbb54de487f/init.d/packages/init-packages-delpa.el#L51-L54),
so in terms of muscle-memory it's easy for me to remember what to press when
I quickly want to skip over from a magit view to the repo forge itself.

Similar to what I wrote [a couple of days back](/2019/10/19/pypath-el.html),
I think this again illustrates how handy Emacs is as a work environment.
While it's absolutely true that there are other development environments out
there that offer similar extensibility, Emacs is the one I'm comfortable
with, and it has a *long* history of offering this.
