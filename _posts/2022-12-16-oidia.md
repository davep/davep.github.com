Another little thing that's up on PyPi now, which is the final bit of
fallout from [the Textual dogfooding
sessions](/2022/12/01/new-things-on-pypi.html), is a little project I'm
calling ODIA.

The application is a streak tracker. I'm quite the fan of streak trackers.
I've used a few over the years, both to help keep me motivated and honest,
and also to help me track that I've avoided unhelpful things too. Now, most
of the apps I've used, and use now, tend to have reminders and counts and
stats and are all about "DO NOT BREAK THE STREAK OR ELSE" and that's mostly
fine, but...

To keep things simple and to purely concentrate on how to build Textual
apps, I made this a "non-judgement" streak tracker. It's designed to be
really simple: you add a streak, you bump up/down the number of times you
did (or didn't do) the thing related to that streak, for each day, and
that's it.

No totals. No stats. No reminders and bugging. No judgement.

Here it is in action:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe
        width="560" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kz8eUzO9-8"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

When I started it, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to store the data.
Throwing it in a SQLite database held some appeal, but that also felt like a
lot of faff for something so simple. Also, I wanted to make the data as easy
to get at, to use elsewhere, and to hack on, as possible. So in the end I
went with a simple JSON file.

On macOS and GNU/Linux `streaks.json` lives in `~/.local/share/oidia`, on
Windows it'll be in... I'm not sure off the top of my head actually; it'll
be in whatever directory [the handy `xdg`
library](https://pypi.org/project/xdg/) has chosen. and because it's JSON
that means that something like this:

ends up looking like this:

```json

            "2022-11-28": 1
        }
    },
    {
        "title": "Run 5k",
        "days": {
            "2022-12-03": 2,
            "2022-12-05": 1,

            "2022-11-28": 2
        }
    },
    {
        "title": "Run 10k",
        "days": {
            "2022-12-03": 1,
            "2022-11-28": 1
        }
    }
]
```

Of course, it remains to be seen how well that actually scales; possibly not
so well over a long period of time, but this was written more as another way
to explore Textual than anything else. Even then, it would be pretty trivial
to update to something better for holding the data.

If this seems like your thing (and I will be supporting it and onward
developing it) you [can find it over on
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/oidia/), which means it can be installed with
`pip` or the ever-handy `pipx`:

```sh
$ pipx install oidia
```
